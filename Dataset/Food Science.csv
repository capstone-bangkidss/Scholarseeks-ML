The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of water temperature (88, 92, 96 and 98°C) on the final quality of three types of EG (Arabica, Robusta Natural blend and Robusta Torrefacto blend) in order to select the optimal temperature. Volatile compound (analysed by Static headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) and sensory flavour profiles were the most relevant parameters, whereas physicochemical, taste and mouthfeel parameters were not very useful for selecting the water temperature. For Arabica and Robusta Natural blend ECs, 92°C was the optimal water temperature. For Robusta Torrefacto blend EC the overall acceptability might lead to the selection of 88°C as the ideal water temperature, but the high percentages of key odorants related to toasty and earthy/musty flavours and the 'not hot enough' perception dictated the selection of 92°C in this case as well. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Arabica coffee; Coffee aroma; Espresso coffee; Extraction temperature; Robusta coffee; Sensory flavour profile; Torrefacto roast","Coffea arabica; Coffea canephora; coffee; food science","","","","","","","Petracco M., Technology I.V., Beverage preparation: Brewing trends for the new millenium, Coffee Recent Developments, pp. 140-164, (2001); Illy A., Viani R., Espresso Coffee: The Chemistry of Quality, (1995); Nunes F.M., Coimbra M.A., Duarte A.C., Delgadillo I., Foamability, foam stability, and chemical composition of espresso coffee as affected by the degree of roast, J Agric Food Chem, 45, pp. 3238-3243, (1997); Maeztu L., Andueza S., Ibanez C., De Pena M.P., Bello J., Cid C., A multivariate method for differentiation of espresso coffees from different botanical varieties and types of roast by foam, taste and mouthfeel characteristics, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 4743-4747, (2001); Maeztu L., Sanz C., Andueza S., De Pena M.P., Bello J., Cid C., Characterization of espresso coffee aroma by HS-GC-MS and sensory flavor profile, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 5437-5444, (2001); Navarini L., Rivetti D., Cappuccio R., Abatangelo A., Petracco M., Suggi-Liverani F., Effects of water composition and water treatment on espresso coffee percolation, Proc 19th Int Sci Colloq on Coffee, (2001); Nicoli M.C., Dalla Rosa M., Lerici C.R., Influences of some processing conditions on solid-liquid extraction of coffee, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 23, pp. 386-389, (1990); Camenga H.K., Eggers R., Hinz T., Steer A., Waldmann C., Extraction in coffee-processing and brewing, Proc 17th Int Colloq on the Chemistry of Coffee, pp. 219-226, (1997); Dalla Rosa M., Barbanti D., Nicoli M.C., Produzione di caffè tostao ad alta resa.

In this respect, cyclodextrins (CDs) could be of interest because they are tasteless, non-caloric and odourless molecules with several valuable characteristics, such as a capacity to separate chiral compounds and solubilize or stabilize bioactive compounds (BaC). Scope and approach: This review represents a revision of the state-of-the-art of CDs and their uses in the food industry. Key findings and conclusions: We analysed their metabolism and regulatory aspects of current applications of CDs: as carriers, for removing components, to produce or extract BaC, their use as nanosensors or in food packaging. We study how inclusion complexed are formed referring to the most common techniques and parameters Moreover, how inclusion complexes are formed will be studied with reference to the most common techniques and parameters. In conclusion, their applications in the food and other industries will increase in the coming years without a doubt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclodextrins; Food industry; Nanosensor; Nutraceuticals; Packaging; “Free products”","Stereochemistry; Bioactive compounds; Chiral compounds; Food industries; Food packaging; Food science; Inclusion complex; Regulatory aspects; State of the art; Cyclodextrins","","","","","Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia; Consejería de Empleo, Universidades, Empresa y Medio Ambiente of the CARM; Fundación Séneca-Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia; Fundación Séneca, (19893/GERM/15); Universidad de Murcia, (R-1042/2015); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation , project AGL 2017-86526-P (MCI/AEI/FEDER, UE) and by the “ Programa de Ayudas a Grupos de Excelencia de la Región de Murcia, Fundación Séneca, Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia (Spain) ” (Project 19893/GERM/15 ).

Recently, a lot of researches and review works have been done focusing on the ink's properties, printer design, and printing parameters. However, few articles specifically describe 3D models and slicing methods used in food printing. This work introduced the requirements for 3D printing models in some specific areas, discussed the critical parameter settings in the model slicing processes, and discussed the possible use of numerical techniques in the model building and printing of food 3D printing. The objective of this review is to increase researchers' focus on 3D printing models and slices in order to optimize the printing process and to provide some useful information for future research. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.","3D food printing; model; model building; numerical technique; slicing","3D printers; Food processing; Numerical methods; Printing presses; 3-D printing; 3d food printing; 3D printing process; 3d-modeling; 3D-printing; Food science; Ink properties; Numerical techniques; Slicing; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; article; three dimensional printing; 3D modeling","","","","","","","A 3D piece of cake, (2018); Autodesk 123d apps, (2018); Tinkercad, (2018); Azam R.S.M., Zhang M., Bhandari B., Yang C., Effect of different gums on features of 3D printed object based on vitamin-D enriched orange concentrate, Food Biophysics, 13, 3, pp. 250-262, (2018); Balasubramanian A., Bettinger C.J., Shape recovery kinetics in vascularized 3D-printed polymeric actuators, Advanced Engineering Materials, 17, 9, pp. 1287-1293, (2015); Baronio G., Harran S., Signoroni A., A critical analysis of a hand orthosis reverse engineering and 3d printing process, Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 2016, (2016); Budmen I., Understanding shells, layer height and infill, (2013); The first high-end restaurant in the netherlands with 3D-printed food on the menu, (2018); Campos A., Molins C., Trubat P., Alarcon D., A 3D FEM model for floating wind turbines support structures, Energy Procedia, 137, pp. 177-185, (2017); Chen C., Lu T.J., Fleck N.A., Effect of inclusions and holes on the stiffness and strength of honeycombs, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 43, 2, pp. 487-504, (2001); Chen T., Lin H., Zhao H., Chen X., Wu T., Li G., Xie L., Agglomerate size evolution in modular twin-screw extruder: Modeling and validation with caco3/lldpe compounding experiments, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 134, 47, (2017); Chua C.K., Leong K.F., 3D Printing and additive manufacturing: Principles and applications, (2014); Chung B., Would you eat 3D-printed meat? 7 Vegetarians and vegans reflect, (2013); D'Angelo G., Hansen H.N., Hart A.J., Molecular gastronomy meets 3D printing: Layered construction via reverse spherification, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 3, 3, pp. 152-159, (2016); Dankar I., Haddarah A., Omar F.E.L., Sepulcre F., Pujola M., 3D Printing technology: The new era for food customization and elaboration, Trends in Food Science & Technology, 75, pp. 231-242, (2018); Derossi A., Caporizzi R., Ricci I., Severini C., Chapter 3—Critical variables in 3D food printing, Fundamentals of 3D food printing and applications, pp. 41-91, (2019); Dhanasekharan K.M., Kokini J.L., Design and scaling of wheat dough extrusion by numerical simulation of flow and heat transfer, Journal of Food Engineering, 60, 4, pp. 421-430, (2003); Interview with Nico Kläber (moléculaire) electrolux design lab finalist, (2009); Emin M.A., Schuchmann H.P., Analysis of the dispersive mixing efficiency in a twin-screw extrusion processing of starch based matrix, Journal of Food Engineering, 115, 1, pp. 132-143, (2013); Feng C., Zhang M., Bhandari B., Materials properties of printable edible inks and printing parameters optimization during 3D printing: A review, Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, pp. 1-8, (2018); Filali A., Khezzar L., Siginer D., Nemouchi Z., Graetz problem with non-linear viscoelastic fluids in non-circular tubes, International Journal of Thermal Sciences, 61, pp. 50-60, (2012); Godoi F.C., Prakash S., Bhandari B.R., 3D Printing technologies applied for food design: Status and prospects, Journal of Food Engineering, 179, pp. 44-54, (2016); Goyanes A., Wang J., Buanz A., Martinez-Pacheco R., Telford R., Gaisford S., Basit A.W., 3D Printing of medicines: Engineering novel oral devices with unique design and drug release characteristics, Molecular Pharmaceutics, 12, 11, pp. 4077-4084, (2015); Halterman T., Survey says?

Even the Vatican and Catholic Church, led by Pope Francis of the Holy See, have weighed in on the immoral nature of what humans have been doing to the earth, its biodiversity, natural environment, and climate. The demand and market for protein, especially from animal sources, is exploding worldwide and as developing nations grow and industrialize, this will only increase. However, already 70% of agricultural land and 30% of all land on earth are utilized to raise animals. The good news is that insects offer a very promising and likely much more environmentally sustainable yet vastly unexplored alternative to other animal-based livestock and indeed are attractive alternatives to many plant and other food and agricultural commodities as well. It is becoming clear that insects can be mass produced with much lower utilization levels of land, water, fertilizer, pesticide, feed, energy, and other resources. These efficiencies are also likely have benefits toward reducing climate change and the destruction of biodiversity and the natural environment. With over 1 million described species on Earth and over 2000 already eaten in various parts of the world, the potential from this diverse resource is seemingly endless. With the recent realization of this fact, a transformative new industry is emerging to capitalize on this promising resource—the insect-based food industry. This new industry is already making substantial inroads toward developing vast new products from the world’s largest and most diverse group of organisms: insects. These can come in many highly useful forms such as powders, pastes, liquids, oils, and the like. Indeed, governments, the media, and even celebrities have also taken notice and have begun supporting the development of insects as a sustainable protein source. In this chapter, we will begin by providing some background on the insect industry as it has developed to date. We will then discuss a number of recommendations for this emerging industry such as marketing strategies, value propositions for insects as food ingredients, a detailed discussion on various critical aspects of food processing to consider with insects, and recommendations on terminology use for this emerging industry going forward, which will improve prospects for marketing and overall success. Later we describe certain needs the industry has in order to grow, such as more and larger farms and elements of infrastructure necessary for success. We conclude with remarks and recommendations for the industry going forward as well as governments and others wishing to support it. This is the most exciting time to be involved in this emerging and transformative new industry, as we work toward establishment of a family and suite of new commodities derived from the largest and most diverse, yet most underutilized, group of organisms on the planet: Class Insecta. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Food science and its associated nutritional health issues have been increasingly debated. Lipids, as complex metabolites, play a key role both in food and human health. Taking advantages of mass spectrometry (MS) by combining its high sensitivity and accuracy with extensive selective determination of all lipid classes, MS-based lipidomics has been employed to resolve the conundrum of addressing both qualitative and quantitative aspects of high-abundance and low-abundance lipids in complex food matrices. In this review, we systematically summarize current applications of MS-based lipidomics in food field. First, common MS-based lipidomics procedures are described. Second, the applications of MS-based lipidomics in food science, including lipid composition characterization, adulteration, traceability, and other issues, are discussed. Third, the application of MS-based lipidomics for nutritional health covering the influence of food on health and disease is introduced. Finally, future research trends and challenges are proposed. MS-based lipidomics plays an important role in the field of food science, promoting continuous development of food science and integration of food knowledge with other disciplines. New methods of MS-based lipidomics have been developed to improve accuracy and sensitivity of lipid analysis in food samples. These developments offer the possibility to fully characterize lipids in food samples, identify novel functional lipids, and better understand the role of food in promoting healt. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®","application; food science; lipidomics; mass spectrometry; nutritional health","Dietary Fats; Food Analysis; Food Technology; Lipid Metabolism; Lipidomics; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Lipids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolites; lipid; Continuous development; High sensitivity; Lipid analysis; Lipid composition; Living standards; Research trends; Science and Technology; Selective determination; fat intake; food analysis; food handling; lipid metabolism; lipidomics; mass spectrometry; procedures; Health","","lipid, 66455-18-3; Dietary Fats, ; Lipids, ","","","Agricultural Industry System of Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China; National Key R&D Program of China; Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, MOA, (CARS‐49 01702020); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFD0901101)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFD0901101) and the Agricultural Industry System of Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China (CARS-49 01702020).

Although there is a long history of public engagement in agriculture and food science, the term ‘citizen science’ has rarely been applied to these efforts. Similarly, in the emerging field of citizen science, most new citizen science projects do not focus on food or agriculture. Here, we convened thought leaders from a broad range of fields related to citizen science, agriculture, and food science to highlight key opportunities for bridging these overlapping yet disconnected communities/fields and identify ways to leverage their respective strengths. Specifically, we show that (i) citizen science projects are addressing many grand challenges facing our food systems, as outlined by the United States National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as broader Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations Development Programme, (ii) there exist emerging opportunities and unique challenges for citizen science in agriculture/food research, and (iii) the greatest opportunities for the development of citizen science projects in agriculture and food science will be gained by using the existing infrastructure and tools of Extension programmes and through the engagement of urban communities. Further, we argue there is no better time to foster greater collaboration between these fields given the trend of shrinking Extension programmes, the increasing need to apply innovative solutions to address rising demands on agricultural systems, and the exponential growth of the field of citizen science. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The kinetics of potassium sorbate release followed Fick's law of diffusion, as shown by diffusional exponent characteristic n-value and high correlation coefficients between experimental and theoretical data. The effects of solution pH at the film surface (3.8, 5.2 and 7.0) and temperature (5, 25 and 40°C) on diffusion were investigated. Diffusion was found to be unaffected by adjacent solution pH in the range of values tested, but a decrease in temperature from 40 to 5°C resulted in a reduction of diffusion coefficients from 4.24×10-13 to 1.29×10-13 m2/s at pH 5.2. © 2004 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

Studies on the isolation and characterisation of peptides and proteins allow compilation of data sets on their structures and properties/activities. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modelling provides methodology to find mathematical expressions for such relationships which may then be useful for estimating activities of any related compound and for predicting structures of high activity. Methodology for transforming peptide and protein structures into data sets are presented, and research relevant for food science and technology are discussed in this review. Peptide QSAR modelling has been especially useful for antimicrobial, ACE-inhibitory and bitter tasting peptides, but could easily be expanded to other areas within food research. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 124, Sweden","Glycerol, a major by-product of ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is of significant importance to the wine, beer, and ethanol production industries. To gain a clearer understanding of and to quantify the extent to which parameters of the pathway affect glycerol flux in S. cerevisiae, a kinetic model of the glycerol synthesis pathway has been constructed. Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD+-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (Cv1J) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (RDHAPJ = 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (RATPJ = -0.21 to -0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (RNADHJ = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.","","Glycerol; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Enzymes; Ethanol; Fermentation; Phosphates; Wine; adenosine triphosphate; alcohol; glycerol; glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; biotechnology; food science; alcohol metabolism; article; beer; catalysis; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; fermentation; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; wine; yeast; Kinetic parameters; Glycerol","","Glycerol, 56-81-5","","","","","Albers E., Larsson C., Liden G., Niklasson C., Gustafsson L., Influence of the nitrogen source on Saccharomyces cerevisiae anaerobic growth and product formation, Appl.

In the human digestive tract, the resident flora generally prevents the establishment of ingested lactic acid bacteria, the presence of which is therefore transient. The aim of this work was to determine if L. casei DN-114 001 survives during transit and how this bacterium behaves in the digestive environment. We used the human flora-associated (HFA) mouse model. L. casei DN-114 001 was genetically modified by the introduction of erm and lux genes, encoding erythromycin resistance and luciferase, respectively. For this modified strain (DN-240 041), light emission related to luciferase expression could easily be detected in the contents of the digestive tract. When inoculated into the digestive tract of HFA mice, L. casei (DN-240 041) survives but is eliminated with the same kinetics as an inert transit marker, indicating that it does not establish itself. In pure culture of L. casei, luciferase activities were high in the exponential and early stationary growth phases but decreased to become undetectable 1 day after inoculation. Viability was only slightly reduced even after more than 5 days. After transit in HFA mice, luciferase activity was detected even when 5-day-old L. casei cultures were given to the mice. In culture, the luciferase activity could be restored after 0.5 to 7 h of incubation in fresh medium or milk containing glucose, unless protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of chloramphenicol or rifampin. These results suggest that in HFA mice L. casei DN-240 041, and thus probably L. casei DN-114 001, is able to initiate new protein synthesis during its transit with the diet. The beneficial properties of L. casei-fermented milk for human health might be related to this protein synthesis in the digestive tract.","","Animals; Cell Division; Culture Media; Digestive System; Gastrointestinal Transit; Genes, Reporter; Humans; Lactobacillus casei; Luciferases; Mice; Models, Animal; Protein Biosynthesis; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus casei; Posibacteria; Biosynthesis; Dairy products; Digestive system; Health; Proteins; luciferase; bacterium; food science; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bacterial growth; colony forming unit; controlled study; digestive system; DNA modification; enzyme activity; fermented product; intestine flora; intestine transit time; Lactobacillus casei; mouse; nonhuman; protein synthesis; Digestive tract; Bacteria","","Culture Media, ; Luciferases, EC 1.13.12.-","","","","","Alpert C.A., Siebers U., The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators, J.

The fish were either sedated with a low dose of MS-222 (14.3 mg L-1) (unstressed groups) or exposed to the air for 3 min (stressed groups) before being submerged in a benzocaine bath (150 g L -1). The fish were then killed by a blow to the head, their gills cut, filleted and finally stored at either 4 or 20°C. The stressed groups had significantly lower pH values after slaughter (pH = 7.0) than the unstressed groups (pH = 7.3). This difference was maintained until post rigor for the fish stored at 4°C, but at 20°C it was immediately overshadowed by a decrease in pH caused by temperature-dependent processes. The length contraction and changes in registered colour values were more pronounced at both the higher temperature and the higher level of pre-slaughter stress. Again temperature dominated, but significant and consistent effects were registered from stress. No significant effects of stress on texture post rigor were observed. It is concluded that high storage temperature masks the majority of effects caused by pre-slaughter stress on the measured variables. Stress management protocols, however, are important when the fillets are kept at the common storage temperature of 4°C. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cod; Fillet; Quality; Rigor; Stress; Temperature","Gadus morhua; fish culture; food science; mariculture; quality control; storage; stress","","","","","","","Abe H., Okuma E., Rigor-mortis progress of carp acclimated to different water temperatures, Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 57, pp. 2095-2100, (1991); Ackman R.G., The influence of lipids on fish quality, Journal of Food Technology, 2, pp. 169-181, (1967); Ando M., Toyohara H., Shimizu Y., Sakagushi M., Post-mortem tenderization of fish muscle proceeds independently of resolution of rigor mortis, Bulletin of the Japanese Society of Scientific Fisheries, 57, pp. 1165-1169, (1991); Azam K., Mackie I.M., Smith J., The effect of slaughter method on the quality of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) during ice storage, International Journal of Food Science and Technology, 24, pp. 69-79, (1989); Bjornevik M., White Muscle Fibre Distribution in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo Salar) and Atlantic Cod (Gadus Morhua) As Affected by External Factors, and Relation to Flesh Quality, (2003); Bjornevik M., Karlsen O., Johnston I.A., Kiessling A., Effect of sustained exercise on white muscle structure and flesh quality in farmed cod (Gadus morhua L.), Aquaculture Research, 34, pp. 55-64, (2003); Cole R.G., Alcock N.K., Handley S.J., Grange K.R., Black S., Carney D., Day J., Ford S., Jerret A.R., Selective capture of blue cod Parapercis colias by potting: Behavioural observations and effects of capture method on peri-mortem fatigue, Fisheries Research, 60, pp. 381-392, (2003); Einen O., Morkore T., Rora A.M.B., Thomassen M.S., Feed ration prior to slaughter - A potential tool for managing product quality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), Aquaculture, 176, pp. 85-104, (1999); Elvevoll E.O., Sorensen N.K., Osterud B., Ofstad R., Martinez I., Processing of marine foods, Meat Science, 43, pp. 265-275, (1996); Esaiassen M., Nilsen H., Joensen S., Skjerdal T., Carlehog M., Eilertsen G., Gundersen B., Elvevoll E., Effects of cathing methods on quality changes during storage of cod (Gadus morhua), Lebensmittel-Wissenschaft Und- Technologie, 37, pp. 643-648, (2004); Hunter R.S., Description and measurement of white surfaces (A report of Inter-Society Color Council Subcommittee on Problem 19: A study of near-white surfaces), Journal of the Optical Society of America, 50, (1958); Jerret A.R., Holland A.J., Cleaver S.E., Rigor contraction in rested and partially exercised Chinook salmon white muscle as affected by temperature, Journal of Food Science, 63, pp. 53-56, (1998); Khan A.W., Some factors causing variation in the texture of similar muscles from comparable animals, Meat Science, 1, pp. 15-39, (1977); Kiessling A., Espe M., Ruohonen K., Morkore T., Texture, gaping and colour of fresh and frozen Atlantic salmon flesh as affected by pre-slaughter iso-eugenol or CO<sub>2</sub> anaesthesia, Aquaculture, 236, pp. 645-657, (2004); Lauritzsen K., Akse L., Johansen A., Joensen S., Sorensen N.K., Olsen R.L., Physical and quality attributes of salted cod (Gadus morhua L.) as affected by the state of rigor and freezing prior to salting, Food Research International, 37, pp. 677-688, (2004); Loughna P.T., Goldspink G., Muscle protein synthesis rates during temperature acclimation in a eurythermal (Cyprinus carpio) and a stenothermal (Salmo gairdneri) species of teleost, Journal of Experimental Biology, 118, pp. 267-276, (1985); Love R.M., The Chemical Biology of Fishes, 2, (1980); Lowe T.E., Ryder J.M., Carragher J.F., Wells R.M.G., Flesh quality in snapper, (Pagrus auratus) affected by capture stress, Journal of Food Science, 58, pp. 770-773, (1993); Morkore T., Hansen S.J., Rorvik K.-A., Product Quality of Farmed Cod.

Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf1p, Atf2p and Lg-Atf1p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF1 and ATF2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf1p and Atf2p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, octyl acetate, and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf2p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf1p. The atf1Δ atf2Δ double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf1p and Atf2p are responsible for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50% of the wild-type strain), propyl acetate (50%), and isobutyl acetate (40%), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF1 and ATF2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes.","","Acetyltransferases; Esters; Fermentation; Gene Deletion; Genes, Fungal; Kinetics; Plasmids; Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Eukaryota; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Alcohols; Beverages; Esters; Gas chromatography; Genes; Volatile organic compounds; Yeast; acetic acid isobutyl ester; alcohol acetyltransferase; ester; gene product; heptyl acetate; hexyl acetate; isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase; octyl acetate; pentyl acetate; phenyl ethyl acetate; propyl acetate; unclassified drug; food science; microbiology; yeast; alcoholic beverage; allele; article; atf1 gene; atf2 gene; beer; biotransformation; brewing; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme mechanism; fermentation; fungal gene; fungal strain; gas chromatography; gene control; gene deletion; gene expression; gene function; gene mutation; gene overexpression; lg atf1 gene; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; reaction analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; volatilization; wine; yeast cell; Intracellular reactions; Microbiology","GENBANK: AY242062, AY242063, AY242064, AY242065, AY242066","acetic acid isobutyl ester, 110-19-0; hexyl acetate, 142-92-7; pentyl acetate, 628-63-7; propyl acetate, 109-60-4; Acetyltransferases, EC 2.3.1.-; alcohol O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.84; ATF2 protein, S cerevisiae, EC 2.3.1.84; Esters, ; Proteins, ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, ","","","","","Alvarez P., Malcorps P., Sa Almeida A., Ferreira A., Meyer A.M., Dufour J.P., Analysis of free fatty acids, fusel alcohols and esters in beer: An alternative to CS2 extraction, J.

Plant proteases have been used in medicine, detergent manufacturing, and food science for many years, but their production is diminishing in favor of those of microbial origin because lower production costs. Papain, bromelain, and ficin are the most frequently employed plant proteases, although new proteases with new and more appealing physicochemical properties for industry are still emerging. DNA technology and genetic engineering shall play, without a doubt, an important role for the production of these proteases at the industrial level. The present review focuses on the applications of traditional plant proteases as well as new proteases discovered during the last 20 years, some of which have already been genetically engineered either to increase production or to strengthen some of their physicochemical properties. The review also refers to the protease classification, action pattern, and main characteristics. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Applications; Genetic engineering; Industrial enzymes; Plant proteases; Protein engineering","Biodegradation; Catalysts; Enzymes; Genetic engineering; Industrial applications; Industry; Bromelain; DNA technology; Engineered plants; Food science; Industrial enzymes; Main characteristics; Microbial origins; Physicochemical property; Plant protease; Production cost; Protein engineering; Manufacture","","","","","Ramon Areces Foundation; Xunta de Galicia","Acknowledgments The authors wish to express their deepest appreciations to Prof. V.

Cider was inoculated with oocysts and exposed to 14.32 mJ of UV irradiation/cm2. Oocyst viability was assessed with the gamma interferon gene knockout (GKO) mouse and infant BALB/cByJ mouse models. All GKO mice challenged with UV-treated cider demonstrated no morbidity or mortality, and infant BALB/c mice challenged with treated cider were negative for the presence of C. parvum. In contrast, the GKO mice challenged with non-UV-treated inoculated cider died and the parasite was detected in the ileums of all challenged infant mice. This study shows that UV irradiation can be used to inactivate C. parvum in fresh apple cider.","","Animals; Beverages; Cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium parvum; Interferon Type II; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Knockout; Rosales; Ultraviolet Rays; Animalia; Cryptosporidium; Cryptosporidium parvum; Malus x domestica; Protozoa; Fruits; Genes; Irradiation; Microorganisms; food science; irradiation; microbiology; animal experiment; apple juice; article; controlled study; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium parvum; flavor; fruit juice; gastroenteritis; knockout mouse; mouse; nonhuman; oocyst; ultraviolet irradiation; Parasites; Microbiology","","Interferon Type II, 82115-62-6","","","","","Arrowood M.J., Hurd M.R., Mead J.R., A new method for evaluating experimental cryptosporidial parasite loads using immunofluorescent flow cytometry, J.

Scope and approach: An overview about the concept of nutricosmetics is here presented, and how food and skin convergence trends the cosmetic industry. Examples of recently developed products are given. Key findings: Food ingredients are being included in cosmetics and other personal care products with the aim of bringing into cosmetic products certain benefits of food ingredients. Moreover, due to the recommendation of the circular economy implementation, an approach to economic growth that is in line with sustainable environmental and economic development, a large number of food industry wastes are being recovered as added-value products by more sustainable and innovative extraction processes to be incorporated into cosmetic products amongst others. Although the potential of bioactive compounds extracted from food is already known, the specific biological activity is now being studied and reported. Conclusions: Natural active food-derived ingredients are marketed as having several benefits on the skin. Their incorporation in food supplements and cosmetics is a reality already marketed. The truth about the benefits of food ingredients in cosmetics is not always properly discussed. The trend of “beauty from within” by oral supplementation is now accompanying the other trend that is “from the kitchen table to the skin”, that refers to the possibility to create cosmetics with the ordinary ingredients one have in the kitchen. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antioxidants;

The volatile components of the raw fish belong to a limited number of groups of compounds. Raw black bream has a higher presence of acids than raw trout, while the latter contains more alcohols, hydrocarbons, esters and phenol derivatives; both contain similar concentrations of saturated aldehydes. The volatiles of the smoked fish basically comprise the compounds also detected in the raw fish together with others produced during the processing. Smoke components detected in both smoked fish species were mainly phenol, guaiacol and syringol derivatives, ketones, acetic acid and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Smoked black bream contained a higher number and higher concentrations of smoke components than smoked rainbow trout. Large variations in concentrations of smoke components in the smoked fish samples indicated that the smoking process had not been totally homogeneous. The presence of autoxidatively derived compounds, such as unsaturated aldehydes, was mainly detected in some smoked bream samples, showing that this degradation process is not occurring homogeneously. The usefulness of the applied techniques for the study of volatile components of raw and smoked fish is shown. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Raw and smoked fish; Solid phase microextraction; Volatile components","Brama; Hyperoglyphe porosa; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae; fish; food science","","","","","","","Girard B., Nakai S., Species differentiation by multivariate analysis of headspace volatile patterns from canned Pacific salmon, J Aquat Food Prod Technol, 2, pp. 51-68, (1993); Medina I., Satue-Gracia M.T., Frankel E.N., Static headspace gas chromatographic analyses to determine oxidation of fish muscle lipids during thermal processing, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 76, pp. 231-236, (1999); Reinert K.H., Hunter J.V., Sabatino T., Dynamic heated headspace analyses of volatile organic compounds present in fish tissue samples, J Agric Food Chem, 31, pp. 1057-1060, (1983); Josephson D.B., Lindsay R.C., Enzymatic generation of volatile aroma compounds from fresh fish, ACS Symp Ser, 317, pp. 201-226, (1996); Lindsay R.C., Flavour of fish, Seafoods: Chemistry, Processing Technology and Quality, pp. 75-84, (1994); Girard B., Nakai S., Static headspace gas chromatographic method for volatiles in canned salmon, J Food Sci, 56, pp. 1271-1274, (1991); Refsgaard H.H.F., Haahr A.M., Jensen B., Isolation and quantification of volatiles in fish by dynamic headspace sampling and mass spectrometry, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 1114-1118, (1999); Cardinal M., Berdague J.L., Dinel V., Knockaert C., Vallet J.L., Effet de différentes techniques de fumage sur la nature des composés volatils et les caractéristiques sensorielles de la chair de saumon, Sci Alim, 17, pp. 679-696, (1997); Vejaphan W., Hsieh T.C.-Y., Williams S.S., Volatile flavor components from boiled crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) tail meat, J Food Sci, 53, pp. 1666-1670, (1988); Milo C., Grosch W., Changes in the odorants of boiled trout (Salmo fario) as affected by the storage of the raw material, J Agric Food Chem, 41, pp. 2076-2081, (1993); Milo C., Grosch W., Detection of odor defects in boiled cod and trout by gas chromatography-olfactometry of headspace samples, J Agric Food Chem, 43, pp. 459-462, (1995); Milo C., Grosch W., Changes in the odorants of boiled salmon and cod as affected by the storage of the raw material, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 2366-2371, (1996); Le Guen S., Prost C., Demaimay M., Characterization of odorant compounds of mussels (Mytilus edulis) according to their origin using gas chromatography-olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, J Chromatogr A, 896, pp. 361-371, (2000); Piveteau F., Le Guen S., Gandemer G., Baud J.-P., Prost C., Demaimay M., Aroma of fresh oysters, Crassostrea gigas: Composition and aroma notes, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 4851-4857, (2000); Le Guen S., Prost C., Demaimay M., Evaluation of the representativeness of the odor of cooked mussel extracts and the relationship between sensory descriptors and potent odorants, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 1321-1327, (2001); Le Guen S., Prost C., Demaimay M., Critical comparison of three olfactometric methods for the identification of the most potent odorants in cooked mussels (Mytilus edulis), J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 1307-1314, (2000); Serot T., Regost C., Prost C., Robin J., Arzel J., Effect of dietary lipid sources on odour-active compounds in muscle of turbot (Psetta maxima), J Sci Food Agric, 81, pp. 1339-1346, (2001); Prost C., Serot T., Demaimay M., Identification of the most potent odorants in wild and farmed cooked turbot (Scophthalamus maximus L), J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 3214-3219, (1998); Ruiz J., Cava R., Ventanas J., Jensen M.T., Headspace solid phase microextraction for the analysis of volatiles in a meat product: Dry-cured Iberian ham, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 4688-4694, (1998); Jelen H.H., Wlazly K., Wasowicz E., Kaminski E., Solid-phase microextraction for the analysis of some alcohols and esters in beer: Comparison with static headspace method, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 1469-1473, (1998); Wilkes J.G., Conte E.D., Kim Y., Holcomb M., Sutherland J.B., Miller D.W., Sample preparation for the analysis of flavours and off-flavours in foods, J Chromatogr A, 880, pp. 3-33, (2000); Guillen M.D., Manzanos M.J., Zabala L., Study of a commercial liquid smoke flavouring by means of GC/MS and FTIR, J Agric Food Chem, 43, pp. 463-468, (1995); Sun Pan B., Kuo J.M., Flavour of shellfish and kamaboko flavorants, Seafoods: Chemistry, Processing Technology and Quality, pp. 85-114, (1994); Flavors and Fragrances, (1998); Bendoraitis J.G., Brown B.L., Hepner L.S., Isoprenoid hydrocarbons in petroleum.

Alcohol-soluble (A1 and A2) and glutelin (G1 and G2) fractions were isolated and compared in terms of their amino acid and protein compositions. The average proportions of nitrogen content between total alcohol-soluble proteins (TASP) and total glutelins (TGlu) in the pseudocereals amaranth and soybean were about 1.8:26.9 and 14.9:12.3 respectively. In the cereals maize and wheat these proportions were 47.8:33.2 and 44.7:31.2 respectively. The sum of essential amino acids was 47.6 and 60.3g per 100g protein in amaranth and soybean respectively. The highest contents of methionine, lysine and arginine were found in the pseudocereals. The relatively high content of essential amino acids shows that pseudocereals could be used as a nutrient substitute for cereals. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Amino acids; Cereals; Proteins;

While many bacteria have been characterised as probiotics, only one yeast variety, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii, has been recognised to be part of this group, regardless of the importance of yeasts in the food industry. In this work, we have studied the probiotic or health-beneficial potential of 130 yeast strains isolated from food belonging to the collection of the Institute of Food Science Research CIAL (CSIC-UAM). To that end, the response of these yeasts to physiological conditions during consumption has been assessed through measuring their capacity to grow at 37 °C and to survive the gastrointestinal transit conditions. Almost 50% of the yeast analysed could thrive at the host intestine temperature, and of these, almost 37% had growth kinetic parameters higher at 37 °C than at 25 °C. In addition, about 95% of the strains could survive the exposition to conditions simulating the gastrointestinal transit. The yeast strains were also analysed for exhibiting auto-aggregation phenotype, antioxidant activity and the production of killer peptides, this only found in 8.5% of the strains analysed. These properties could be regarded as additional interesting features for selecting new probiotic strains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Antioxidant activity; Gastrointestinal transit; Killer peptides; Probiotics; Yeasts","Antioxidants; Automotive industry; Peptides; Physiological models; Probiotics; Veterinary medicine; Yeast; Animal health; Anti-oxidant activities; Food industries; Food science; Gastrointestinal transit; Physiological condition; Probiotic strain; Yeast strain; Food microbiology","","","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (AGL2012-35814, RM2011-00003-00-00)","This work has been funded by the Spanish MINECO (projects RM2011-00003-00-00 and AGL2012-35814 ).

DNA templates for PCR experiments were directly extracted from the cheese as well as bulk cells harvested from a variety of viable-count media. The variable V3 and V4-V5 regions of the 16S genes were analyzed. Closest relatives of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcusfaecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus sp. were identified by sequencing of the DGGE fragments. Fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes were developed to detect Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments, and their specificity for the species occurring in the community of Stilton cheese was checked in FISH experiments carried out with reference cultures. The combined use of these probes and the bacterial probe Eub338 in FISH experiments on Stilton cheese sections allowed the assessment of the spatial distribution of the different microbial species in the dairy matrix. Microbial colonies of bacteria showed a differential location in the different parts of the cheese examined: the core, the veins, and the crust. Lactococci were found in the internal part of the veins as mixed colonies and as single colonies within the core. Lactobacillus plantarum was detected only underneath the surface, while Leuconostoc microcolonies were homogeneously distributed in all parts observed. The combined molecular approach is shown to be useful to simultaneously describe the structure and location of the bacterial flora in cheese. The differential distribution of species found suggests specific ecological reasons for the establishment of sites of actual microbial growth in the cheese, with implications of significance in understanding the ecology of food systems and with the aim of achieving optimization of the fermentation technologies as well as preservation of traditional products.","","Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterococcus; Enterococcus faecalis; Enterococcus faecalis; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus curvatus; Lactobacillus curvatus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis; Leuconostoc; Leuconostoc mesenteroides; Leuconostoc mesenteroides; Posibacteria; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus equorum; Staphylococcus equorum; Staphylococcus sp.; Streptococcus; Dairy products; DNA; Ecology; Electrophoresis; Fermentation; Fluorescence; Optimization; ribosome DNA; Stilton cheese; bacterium; community structure; food science; microbial community; article; bacterial flora; bacterial growth; bacterium colony; bacterium identification; cheese; DNA determination; DNA template; Enterococcus faecalis; fermentation; fluorescence in situ hybridization; food composition; gel electrophoresis; gene sequence; genetic variability; Lactobacillus curvatus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Lactococcus lactis; Leuconostoc; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oligonucleotide probe; polymerase chain reaction; preservation; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus equorum; Microbiology","GENBANK: AF498046, AF498047, AF498059, AF498060, AF498061, AF498062, AF498063, AF498064, AF498065, AF498066, AF498067, AF498068, AF498069, AF498070, AF498072, AF498073, AF498075, AF498076, AF498077, AF498078, AF498079, AF498080, AF498081, AF502284, AF498048, AF498049, AF498050, AF498051, AF498052, AF498053, AF498054, AF498055, AF498056, AF498057, AF498058","","","","","","Albenzio M., Corbo M.R., Rehman S.U., Fox P.F., De Angelis M., Corsetti A., Sevi A., Gobetti M., Microbiological and biochemical characteristics of Canestrato Pugliese cheese made from raw milk, pasteurized milk or by heating the curd in hot whey, Int.

The liquid-holding capacity of farmed halibut muscle varied throughout the season. A significant increase in liquid loss was observed in July and August, indicating that the quality is lower in these months. The liquid loss (LL) increased with decreasing pH at pH lower than 6.3, whereas at higher pH, the LL was independent of pH. In the farmed halibut, the average muscle pH 6.14 varied from 5.90 to 6.64. Average muscle pH in the wild halibut (6.41) varied from 6.33 to 6.49. The fat content in the wild halibut muscle was <0.2% throughout the sampling period, while in the farmed halibut, it varied from 3.5% to 7.4%. The fatty acid composition in the muscles of halibut can be explained by the amount of fat in the muscle and the dietary fatty acids. The fatty acids present in the muscle of wild halibut are consistent with a very low fat content mostly made up by structural phospholipids. Although the proportions of the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are lower in the farmed than in the wild halibut, the total amounts are much higher. It was evident from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the sensory and chemical data that the differences were mainly seen in textural attributes and that chemical and sensory analysis described the same quality properties. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The diets were fed between 7 and 28 days of age, and both the gross response and mechanisms involved were evaluated. The highest level of BM in the diet resulted in longer (P < 0.01) jejunal villi than those observed at other levels of supplementation. The RNA content of the ileal mucosal homogenate was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in chicks raised on diets supplemented with 3.0 and 5.0g BMkg-1 diet than in other groups. The protein/DNA ratio of the jejunal mucosal homogenate was also higher (P < 0.05) in chicks fed the 1.0g BMkg-1 diet than in chicks fed the other diets. The protein/RNA and RNA/DNA ratios in ileal homogenates were significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by the presence of BM in the diet. There were significantly greater specific activities of maltase (P < 0.01), leucine aminopeptidase (P < 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.001) in the jejunum as a result of supplementation with BM. Digestive enzyme activities in the ileum were unaffected. L-Tryptophan uptake by jejunal brush-border membrane vesicles was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in chicks raised on the 5.0g BMkg-1 diet than in the other chicks. The supplement led to minor improvement in body weight but no improvement in feed conversion ratio. These effects were related to changes in digestive enzyme activities and, perhaps, amino acid transport. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Bio-Mos™; Body growth; Broiler chickens; Intestinal function; Mannan oligosaccharide","age; alkaline phosphatase; alpha glucosidase; chicken; concentration (parameters); cytosol aminopeptidase; diet; DNA; enzyme activity; food analysis; intestine; lupin; mannan; nutrient uptake; oligosaccharide; protein; sorghum; tryptophan; food science","","","","","","","Fleming S.E., A study of relationships between flatus potential and carbohydrate distribution in legume seeds, J Food Sci, 46, pp. 794-798, (1981); Saini H.S., Knights E.J., Chemical constitution of starch and oligosaccharide components of 'Desi' and 'Kabuli' chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seed types, J Agric Food Chem, 32, pp. 940-944, (1984); Irish G.G., Barbour G.W., Classen H.L., Tyler R.T., Bedford M.R., Removal of the alpha galactosides of sucrose from soybean meal using either ethanol extraction or exogenous alpha galactosidase and broiler performance, Poultry Sci, 74, pp. 1484-1494, (1995); Bailey J.S., Blankenship L.C., Cox N.A., Effect of fructooligosaccharide on Salmonella colonization of the chicken intestine, Poultry Sci, 70, pp. 2433-2438, (1991); Monsan P.F., Paul F., Oligosaccharide feed additives, Biotechnology in Animal Feeds and Feeding, pp. 233-245, (1995); Choi K.H., Namkung H., Paik I.K., Effects of dietary fructooligosaccharides on the suppression of intestinal colonization of Salmonella typhimurium in broiler chickens, Kor J Anim Sci, 36, pp. 271-284, (1994); Okumura J., Furuse M., Kawamura T., Toyoshima K., Sugawara M., Suzuki T., Seo G., Soga H., Effects of glucooligosaccharide and biobacteria on egg production rate and cecal bacterial population in the chicken, Jpn Poultry Sci, 31, pp. 189-194, (1994); Coon C.N., Leske K.L., Akavanichan O., Cheng T.K., Effect of oligosaccharide free soybean meal on true metabolizable energy and fiber digestion in adult roosters, Poultry Sci, 69, pp. 787-793, (1990); Leske K.L., Jevne C.J., Coon C.N., Effect of oligosaccharide additions on nitrogen corrected true metabolizable energy of soy protein concentrate, Poultry Sci, 72, pp. 664-668, (1993); Perry F.G., Biotechnology in animal feeds and feeding, an overview, Biotechnology in Animal Feeds and Feeding, pp. 1-15, (1995); Oyarzabal O.A., Conner D.E., In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria, Poultry Sci, 74, pp. 1418-1425, (1995); Terada A., Hara H., Sakamoto J., Sato N., Takagi S., Mitsuoka T., Mino R., Hara K., Fujimori I., Yamada T., Effects of dietary supplementation with lactosucrose (4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose) on cecal flora, cecal metabolites, and performance in broiler chickens, Poultry Sci, 73, pp. 1663-1672, (1994); Waldroup A.L., Skinner J.T., Hierholzer R.E., Waldroup P.W., An evaluation of fructooligosaccharide in diets for broiler chickens and effects on salmonellae contamination of carcasses, Poultry Sci, 72, pp. 643-650, (1993); Official Methods of Analysis, 15th edn., pp. 781-782, (1990); Englyst H.N., Quigley M.E., Hudson G.J., Cummings J.H., Determination of dietary fibre as non-starch polysaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography, Analyst, 117, pp. 1707-1714, (1992); Iji P.A., Hughes R.J., Choct M., Tivey D.R., Intestinal structure and function of broiler chickens on wheat-based diets supplemented with a microbial enzyme, Asia-Aust J Anim Sci, 14, pp. 54-60, (2001); Bradford M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding, Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254, (1976); Lemmens J.W.T.J., Nucleic acid levels, cellular activity and growth during the puerulus stage of the Western Rock Lobster (Panulirus cygnus (George); Decapoda: Palinuridae), J Exp Marine Biol Ecol, 194, pp. 143-156, (1995); Waterlow J.C., Garlick P.J., Millward D.J., Protein turnover and growth, Protein Turnover in Mammalian Tissues and in Whole Body, pp. 529-594, (1978); Shirazi-Beechey S.P., Smith M.W., Wang Y., James P.S., Postnatal development of lamb intestinal digestive enzymes is not regulated by diet, J Physiol, 437, pp. 691-698, (1991); Dahlqvist D., Method for assay of intestinal disaccharidases, Anal Biochem, 7, pp. 18-25, (1964); Forstner G.G., Sabesin S.M., Isselbacher K.J., Rat intestinal microvillus membranes.

G1K 7P4, Canada","In this study, we report that Lactococcus lactis strains producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) are sensitive to virulent phages. Eight distinct lytic phages (Q61 to Q68) specifically infecting Eps+ strains were isolated in 47 buttermilk samples obtained from 13 North American factories. The eight phages were classified within the 936 species by the multiplex PCR method, indicating that these phages are not fundamentally distinct from those infecting Eps- L. lactis strains. The host range of these phages was determined with 19 Lactococcus strains, including 7 Eps+ and 12 Eps- cultures. Three phages (Q62, Q63, and Q64) attacked only the Eps+ strain SMQ-419, whereas the five other phages (Q61, Q65, Q66, Q67, and Q68) infected only the Eps+ strain SMQ-420. The five other Eps+ strains (H414, MLT2, MLT3, SMQ-461, and SMQ-575) as well as the 12 Eps- strains were insensitive to these phages. The monosaccharide composition of the polymer produced by the seven Eps+ strains was determined. The EPS produced by strains MLT3, SMQ-419, and SMQ-575 contained glucose, galactose, and rhamnose. The EPS fabricated by H414 contained only galactose. The EPS made by MLT2, SMQ-420, and SMQ-461 contained glucose and galactose. These findings indicate that the sugar composition of the EPS has no effect on phage sensitivity. The plasmid encoding the eps operon was cured from the two phage-sensitive strains. The cured derivatives were still phage sensitive, which indicates that EPS are not necessary for phage infection. Phage adsorption assays showed that the production of EPS does not confer a significant phage resistance phenotype.","","Bacteriophages; Lactococcus lactis; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Polysaccharides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Posibacteria; Streptococcus; unidentified bacteriophage; Adsorption; Bioassay; Derivatives; Glucose; Polymers; Polysaccharides; galactose; glucose; polysaccharide; rhamnose; food science; microbiology; adsorption; article; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolate; carbohydrate analysis; carbohydrate metabolism; Lactococcus lactis; phage display; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; Phage-host interactions; Bacteriophages","","Polysaccharides, ","","","","","Ackermann H.-W., Cantor E.D., Jarvis A.W., Lembke J., Mayo J.A., New species definitions in phages of Gram-positive cocci, Intervirology, 22, pp. 181-190, (1984); Albert M.J., Bhuiyan N.A., Rahman A., Ghosh A.N., Hultenby K., Weintraub A., Nahar S., Kibriya A.K.M.G., Ansaruzzaman M., Shimada T., Phage specific for Vibrio cholerae O139 Bengal, J.

We describe the characterization and cloning of the O. oeni ftsH gene, encoding a protease belonging to the ATP binding cassette protein superfamily. The O. oeni FtsH protein is closest in sequence similarity to the FtsH homologue of Lactococcus lactis. The O. oeni ftsH gene proved to be stress-responsive, since its expression increased at high temperatures or under osmotic shock. O. oeni FtsH protein function was tested in an Escherichia coli ftsH mutant strain, and consistent with the O. oeni ftsH gene expression pattern, the O. oeni FtsH protein provided protection for the E. coli ftsH mutant against heat shock. O. oeni and Bradyrhizobium japonicum FtsH proteins also triggered E. coli resistance to wine toxicity. Genes homologous to O. oeni ftsH were detected in many other lactic acid bacteria found in wine, suggesting that this type of gene constitutes a well-conserved stress-protective molecular device.","","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bradyrhizobium japonicum; Bradyrhizobium japonicum; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Lactobacillus delbrueckii; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis; Oenococcus oeni; Oenococcus oeni; Posibacteria; Prokaryota; Bacteria; pH effects; Toxicity; Wine; adenosine triphosphate; lactic acid; mutant protein; protein; protein FtsH; proteinase; unclassified drug; Growth-inhibitory compounds; bacterium; food science; microbiology; antibiotic resistance; article; bacterial genetics; gene cassette; genetic analysis; genetic code; heat shock; high temperature; infection prevention; Lactobacillus delbrueckii; molecular biology; molecular cloning; nonhuman; Oenococcus; osmosis; protein analysis; protein binding; protein expression; protein family; protein function; sequence homology; stress; toxicity; wine; Genes","GENBANK: AY196466","adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; lactic acid, 113-21-3, 50-21-5; protein, 67254-75-5; proteinase, 9001-92-7","","","","","Akiyama Y., Ogura T., Ito K., Involvement of FtsH in protein assembly into and through the membrane.

The population biology of O. oeni is poorly understood and remains unclear. For a better understanding of the mode of genetic variation within this species, we investigated by using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) with the gyrB, pgm, ddl, recP, and mleA genes the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among 18 O. oeni strains isolated in various years from wines of the United States, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. These strains have also been characterized by ribotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region (ISR). Ribotyping grouped the strains into two groups; however, the RFLP analysis of the ISRs showed no differences in the strains analyzed. In contrast, MLST in oenococci had a good discriminatory ability, and we have found a higher genetic diversity than indicated by ribotyping analysis. All sequence types were represented by a single strain, and all the strains could be distinguished from each other because they had unique combinations of alleles. Strains assumed to be identical showed the same sequence type. Phylogenetic analyses indicated a panmictic population structure in O. oeni. Sequences were analyzed for evidence of recombination by split decomposition analysis and analysis of clustered polymorphisms. All results indicated that recombination plays a major role in creating the genetic heterogeneity of O. oeni. A low standardized index of association value indicated that the O. oeni genes analyzed are close to linkage equilibrium. This study constitutes the first step in the development of an MLST method for O. oeni and the first example of the application of MLST to a nonpathogenic food production bacteria.","","Alleles; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Sequence; DNA, Bacterial; Fermentation; Gram-Positive Cocci; Leuconostoc; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Recombination, Genetic; Ribotyping; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Variation (Genetics); Wine; Bacteria (microorganisms); Oenococcus oeni; Posibacteria; Prokaryota; Decomposition; Fermentation; Genes; Microbiology; Wine; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) B; protein ddl; protein mleA; protein pgm; protein recP; RNA 16S; RNA 23S; unclassified drug; bacterium; biotechnology; food science; genetic variation; population structure; allele; article; bacterial strain; controlled study; DNA polymorphism; gene amplification; genetic heterogeneity; genetic linkage; genetic recombination; genetic variability; housekeeping gene; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Oenococcus; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; population structure; restriction fragment length polymorphism; ribotyping; sequence analysis; Allelic diversity; Genetic variation; Intergenic spacer region (ISR); Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP); Ribotyping; Microorganisms","GENBANK: AJ618989, AJ618990, AJ618991, AJ618992, AJ618993, AJ618994, AJ618995, AJ618996, AJ618997, AJ618998, AJ618999, AJ619000, AJ619001, AJ619002, AJ619003, AJ619004, AJ619005, AJ619006, AJ619007, AJ619008, AJ619009, AJ619010, AJ619011, AJ619012, AJ619013, AJ619014, AJ619015, AJ619016, AJ619017, AJ619018, AJ619666, AJ619667, AJ619668, AJ619669, AJ619670, AJ619671, AJ619672, AJ619673, AJ619674, AJ619675","Bacterial Proteins, ; DNA, Bacterial, ","","","","","Brito L., Pavela H., Presence and analysis of large plasmids in Oenococcus oeni, Plasmid, 41, pp. 260-267, (1999); Britz T.J., Tracey R.P., The combination effect of pH, SO<sub>2</sub>, ethanol and temperature on the growth of Leuconostoc oenos, J.

The general purpose of this review is to introduce poly-lactic acid (PLA), a compostable, biodegradable thermoplastic made from renewable sources. PLA properties and modifications via different methods, like using modifiers, blending, copolymerizing, and physical treatments, are mentioned; these are rarely discussed together in other reviews. Industrial processing methods for producing different PLA films, wrappings, laminates, containers (bottles and cups), are presented. The capabilities of PLA for being a strong active packaging material in different areas requiring antimicrobial and antioxidant characteristics are discussed. Consequently, applications of nanomaterials in combination with PLA structures for creating new PLA nanocomposites with greater abilities are also covered. These approaches may modify PLA weaknesses for some food packaging applications. Nanotechnology approaches are being broadened in food science, especially in packaging material science with high performances and low concentrations and prices, so this category of nano-research is estimated to be revolutionary in food packaging science in the near future. The linkage of a 100% bio-originated material and nanomaterials opens new windows for becoming independent, primarily, of petrochemical-based polymers and, secondarily, for answering environmental and health concerns will undoubtedly be growing with time. © 2010 Institute of Food Technologists®.","","Biodegradable polymers;

Box 1627, Finland","The interaction between two Fusarium mycotoxins, zearalenone (ZEN) and its derivative ά-zearalenol (α-ZOL), with two food-grade strains of Lactobacillus was investigated. The mycotoxins (2 μg ml-1) were incubated with either Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG or L. rhamnosus strain LC705. A considerable proportion (38 to 46%) of both toxins was recovered from the bacterial pellet, and no degradation products of ZEN and ά-ZOL were detected in the high-performance liquid chromatograms of the supernatant of the culturing media and the methanol extract of the pellet. Both heat-treated and acid-treated bacteria were capable of removing the toxins, indicating that binding, not metabolism, is the mechanism by which the toxins are removed from the media. Binding of ZEN or α4́-ZOL by lyophilized L. rhamnosus GG and L. rhamnosus LC705 was a rapid reaction: approximately 55% of the toxins were bound instantly after mixing with the bacteria. Binding was dependent on the bacterial concentration, and coincubation of ZEN with ά-ZOL significantly affected the percentage of the toxin bound, indicating that these toxins may share the same binding site on the bacterial surface. These results can be exploited in developing a new approach for detoxification of mycotoxins from foods and feeds.","","Aflatoxins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Estrogens, Non-Steroidal; Lactobacillus; Trichothecenes; Zearalenone; Zeranol; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fusarium; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Posibacteria; Bacteria; Degradation; Detoxification; High performance liquid chromatography; Metabolism; alpha zearalenol; mycotoxin; zearalenone; bacterium; food science; article; bacterial membrane; bacterium culture; binding site; detoxification; estrogen activity; food contamination; high performance liquid chromatography; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; nonhuman; protein binding; protein interaction; protein metabolism; temperature dependence; Bacterial surfaces; Microbiology","","Aflatoxins, ; Estrogens, Non-Steroidal, ; Trichothecenes, ; zearalenol, ; Zearalenone, 17924-92-4; Zeranol, 26538-44-3","","","","","Boswald C., Engelhardt G., Vogel H., Wallnofer P.R., Metabolism of the Fusarium mycotoxins zearalenone and deoxynivalenol by yeast strains of technological relevance, Nat.

This focusing of consumer interest on the food supply, and also extensive research and technological developments in food science will provide further opportunities for new product development. The Food-Based Dietary Guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Union (EU) legislation on health claims play an important role in regulating information to the public about a wholesome diet and for improving the availability and affordability of nutritious food choices to consumers. More specifically, the food industry can contribute by reducing the number of energy-dense products; by improving the nutrient profile of processed food through the reduction of salt, added sugar, trans-fatty acid, and saturated fat content. As a result, food science and technology are prompted to create a new framework for these food-based dietary guidelines, principally in the areas of food physics, methods of food storage and preservation, nutrient restoration and fortification of foods, and the development of health-focused designer foods and functional foods. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of some further opportunities for new product development and nutrition research. Some topics related to the energy reduction of foods include: dilution and structure design, carbohydrate and/or fat substitutes, and inhibition of enzymes in carbohydrate and/or fat digestion; additionally, regulation of some metabolic functions with food-derived bioactive peptides and probiotics, and enrichment of foods with bioactive compounds are reviewed in this overview as the most promising issues. © 2011 Institute of Food Technologists ®.","","Enzyme inhibition; Food supply; Health; Laws and legislation; Nutrients; Nutrition; Organic compounds; Product development; Saturated fatty acids; Sugars; Bioactive compounds; Bioactive peptides; Consumer interests; Dietary Guidelines; Energy reduction; European union; Fat contents; Fat substitute; Food industries; Food science; Food science and technology; Functional foods; Metabolic function; New product development; Probiotics; Research and technological development; Structure design; Technological applications; Trans fatty acid; World Health Organization; Food storage","","","","","","","Acosta E., Bioavailability of nanoparticles in nutrient and nutraceutical delivery, Curr Opin Colloid In, 14, pp. 3-15, (2009); Akillioglu H.G., Karakaya S., Effects of heat treatment and in vitro digestion on the angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of some legume species, Eur Food Res Technol, 229, pp. 915-921, (2009); Allgood G., Kuter D.J., Roll K.T., Taylor S.L., Zorich N.L., Postmarketing surveillance of new food ingredients: results from the program with the fat replacer Olestra, Regul Toxicol Pharm, 33, pp. 224-233, (2001); Anal A.K., Singh H., Recent advances in microencapsulation of probiotics for industrial applications and targeted delivery, Trends Food Sci Tech, 18, pp. 240-251, (2007); Anglei J.P.F., Ribeiro L.R., Angeli J.L.F., Mantovani M.S., Protective effects of β-glucan extracted from barley against benzo[a]pyrene-induced DNA damage in hepatic cell HepG2, Exp Toxicol Pathol, 61, pp. 83-89, (2009); Annan N.T., Borza A.D., Truelstrup L., Encapsulation in alginate-coated gelatin microspheres improves survival of the probiotic Bifidobacterium adolescentis 15703T during exposure to simulated gastro-intestinal conditions, Food Res Int, 41, pp. 184-193, (2008); Anton S.T., Martin C.K., Han H., Coulon S., Cefalu W.T., Geiselman P., Williamson D.A., Effects of stevia, aspartame, and sucrose on food intake, satiety, and postprandial glucose and insulin levels, Appetite, 55, pp. 37-43, (2010); Apostolidis E., Lee C.M., In vitro potential of Ascophyllum nodosum phenolic antioxidant-mediated α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition, J Food Sci Technol, 75, pp. 97-102, (2010); Arcia P.L., Costell E., Tarrega A., Inulin blend as prebiotic and fat replacer in dairy desserts: optimization by response surface methodology, J Dairy Sci, 94, 5, pp. 2192-2200, (2011); Ardevol A., Blade C., Salvado M.J., Arola L., Changes in lipolysis and hormone-sensitive lipase expression caused by procyanidins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord, 24, pp. 319-324, (2000); Arimi J.M., Duggan E., O'Riordan E.D., O'Sullivan M., Lyng J.G., Microwave expansion of imitation cheese containing resistant starch, J Food Eng, 88, pp. 254-262, (2008); Ashwell M., Concepts of functional foods, (2002); Azorin-Ortuno M., Urban C., Ceron J.J., Tecles F., Allende A., Tomas-Barberan F.A., Espin J.C., Effect of low inulin doses with different polymerisation degree on lipid metabolism, mineral absorption, and intestinal microbiota in rats with fat-supplemented diet, Food Chem, 113, pp. 1058-1065, (2009); Bayarri S., Chulia I., Costell E., Comparing λ-carrageenan and an inulin blend as fat replacers in carboxymethyl cellulose dairy desserts.

The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2. The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review. Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid. This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers. Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity. On the other hand, commercial farming - limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas - was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market. Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries. The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms. The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems – in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs. © 2020","COVID-19 pandemic; Food security; Food sovereignty; Subsistence farming; Sustainable development goals; System resilience","Nepal; agricultural policy; agriculture; expert system; farming system; food availability; food science; food security; grassland; health impact; literature review; policy making; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","Institute for Study and Development Worldwide; Nepalese Association of Agriculture, Forestry and Environment","We acknowledge Nepalese Association of Agriculture, Forestry and Environment in Australia (NEPAFE) for hosting the panel discussions and the Institute for Study and Development Worldwide (IFSD), Sydney for in-kind support in literature review, virtual discussions, and interviews.

The use of neutron techniques in combination with traditional characterisation techniques used in food science can provide a unique insight into novel food materials, providing the knowledge to develop new formulations. As these methods have traditionally been poorly utilised in food science research, this paper highlights the potential of neutron scattering techniques in this arena and provides some recent examples in its application across food components with an outlook of some potentially interesting applications.

A recent national survey revealed that 36% of preschool children in Sri Lanka have vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol <0.2 μg ml-1). In view of its well-established association with child morbidity and mortality, this is a reason for concern. One of the main fruits which has been recommended for prevention of vitamin A deficiency in Sri Lanka is papaya (Carica papaya L). In this study the carotenoid profiles of yellow- and red-fleshed papaya were analysed by medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) and UV-vis spectrophotometry. A section of yellow-fleshed papaya showed small carotenoid globules dispersed all over the cell, whereas in red-fleshed papaya the carotenoids were accumulated in one large globule. The major carotenoids of yellow-fleshed papaya were the provitamin A carotenoids β-carotene (1.4 ± 0.4 μg g-1 dry weight (DW)) and β-cryptoxanthin (15.4 ± 3.3 μg g-1 DW) and the non-provitamin A carotenoid ζ-carotene (15.1 ± 3.4 μg g-1 DW), corresponding theoretically to 1516 ± 342 μg kg-1 DW mean retinol equivalent (RE). Red-fleshed papaya contained the provitamin A carotenoids β-carotene (7.0 ± 0.7 μg g-1 DW), β -cryptoxanthin (16.9 ± 2.9 μg g-1 DW) and β-carotene-5,6-epoxide (2.9 ± 0.6 μg g-1 DW), and the non-provitamin A carotenoids lycopene (11.5 ± 1.8 μg g-1 DW) and ζ-carotene (9.9 ± 1.1 μg g-1 DW), corresponding theoretically to 2815 ± 305 μg kg-1 DW mean RE. Thus the carotenoid profile and organisation of carotenoids in the cell differ in the two varieties of papaya. This study demonstrates that carotenoids can be successfully separated, identified and quantified using the novel technique of MPLC. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carica papaya; Carotenoids; Dispersion; Structure","Sri Lanka; Carica papaya; carotenoid; food science; fruit; vitamin deficiency","","","","","","","De Pee S., West C.E., Dietary carotenoids and their role in combating vitamin A deficiency: Review of the literature, Eur J Clin Nutr, 50, pp. 85-126, (1996); De Pee S., West C.E., Muhilal K.D., Hautvast J.G.A.J., Lack of improvement in vitamin A status with increased consumption of dark green leafy vegetables, Lancet, 346, pp. 75-81, (1995); Bendich A., Non-provitamin A activity of carotenoids: Immunoenhancement, Trends Food Sci Technol, 2, pp. 127-130, (1991); Matthews-Roth M.M., Recent progress in the medical applications of carotenoids, Pure Appl Chem, 63, pp. 147-156, (1991); Kinsky N.I., Carotenoids as antioxidant, Nutrition, 17, pp. 815-817; Report of the Survey on Vitamin A Deficiency and Selected World Summit Goals for Children in Sri Lanka 1995/96, (1998); Speek A.J., Speek-Saichua S., Schreurs W.H.P., Total carotenoid and β-carotene contents of Thai vegetables and the effect of processing, Food Chem, 27, pp. 245-257, (1988); Yamamoto H., Differences in carotenoid composition between red- and yellow-fleshed papaya, Nature, 201, pp. 1049-1050, (1964); Philip T., Chen T.S., Quantitative analyses of major carotenoid fatty acid esters in fruits by liquid chromatography: Persimmon and papaya, J Food Sci, 53, pp. 1720-1722, (1988); Cano M.P., De Ancos B., Loboy M.G., Monreal M., Effects of freezing and canning of papaya slices on their carotenoid composition, Z Lebensm Untersuch Forsch, 202, pp. 279-284, (1996); Pepping F., Vencken C.M.J., West C.E., Retinol and carotene content of foods consumed in East Africa determined by high performance liquid chromatography, J Sci Food Agric, 45, pp. 359-371, (1988); Godoy H.T., Rodriguez-Amaya D.B., Occurrence of cis-isomers of provitamin A in Brazilian fruits, J Agric Food Chem, 42, pp. 1306-1313, (1994); Kimura M., Rodiguez-Amaya D., Yokoyama S.M., Cultivar differences and geographic effects on the carotenoid composition and vitamin A values of papaya, Lebens Wiss Technol, 24, pp. 415-418, (1991); Rodriguez-Amaya D.B., A Guide to Carotenoid Analysis in Foods, pp. 15-16, (1999); Ershov I.V., Dmitrovski A.A., Bykhovskii V.I., The character of the interaction of beta-carotene-15,15′ -dioxygenase from rabbit small intestine with lycopene, 15,15′ -dehydro-beta-carotene, lutein, and astaxanthine, Biokhimiia, 58, pp. 733-739, (1993); La Placa M., Pazzaglia M., Tosti A., Lycopenaemia, J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 14, pp. 311-312, (2000)","U.G.

Box 20, Netherlands","The dairy starter bacterium Lactococcus lactis is able to synthesize folate and accumulates large amounts of folate, predominantly in the polyglutamyl form. Only small amounts of the produced folate are released in the extracellular medium. Five genes involved in folate biosynthesis were identified in a folate gene cluster in L. lactis MG1363: folA, folB, folKE, folP, and folC. The gene folKE encodes the biprotein 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase and GTP cyclohydrolase I. The overexpression offolKE in L. lactis was found to increase the extracellular folate production almost 10-fold, while the total folate production increased almost 3-fold. The controlled combined overexpression of folKE and folC, encoding polyglutamyl folate synthetase, increased the retention of folate in the cell. The cloning and overexpression of folA, encoding dihydrofolate reductase, decreased the folate production twofold, suggesting a feedback inhibition of reduced folates on folate bisynthesis.","","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis; Posibacteria; Streptococcus; Biosynthesis; Cells; Cloning; Genes; Metabolism; 2 amino 4 hydroxy 6 hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase; folic acid; guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I; phosphotransferase; unclassified drug; Metabolic engineering; food science; microbiology; amino acid metabolism; article; bioavailability; dietary intake; folic acid deficiency; gene cluster; gene overexpression; glycolysis; Lactococcus lactis; metabolic engineering; molecular cloning; negative feedback; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; strain difference; Enzymes","GENBANK: AY156932","folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I, 37289-19-3; phosphotransferase, 9031-09-8, 9031-44-1","","","","","Alm L., Effect of fermentation on B-vitamins content of milk in Sweden, J.

The inhibitory effect on bacterial growth increased proportionally to the CO2 concentration in the packaging, maximum inhibition being achieved with 100% CO2 (P < 0.05). Seabass slices stored in CO2-enriched atmosphere had lower total volatile base, trimethylamine, ammonia and formaldehyde contents than those stored in air (P < 0.05). However, increases in lightness and exudate loss were observed for samples packaged in high-CO2 atmosphere, suggesting the denaturation of both muscle and pigment proteins by carbonic acid formed. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) increased as the CO2 concentration increased (P <0.05). However, odour, flavour and overall acceptability of CO2-enriched packaged samples, particularly with 80 and 100% CO2, were acceptable throughout storage for 21 days. Chemical and microbial changes in all samples were generally in agreement with sensory panel evaluations. The shelf-life of seabass slices packaged in 80-100% CO2 atmosphere could be extended to more than 20 days at 4°C, compared with 9 days for those packaged in air. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Modified atmosphere; Packaging; Seabass; Shelf-life","Bacteria (microorganisms); atmosphere; fish; food safety; food science; storage","","","","","","","Judprasong K., Nutritive value of commonly consumed fish: proximate composition, fatty acid and cholesterol, pp. 41-87, (1996); Reddy N.R., Villanueva M., Kautter D.A., Shelf-life of modified atmosphere packaged fresh tilapia fillets stored under refrigeration and temperature abuse conditions, J Food Protect, 58, pp. 908-914, (1995); Pedrosa-Menabrito A., Regenstein J.M., Shelf life extension of fresh fish: A review.

The different proportion of Arabica and Robusta coffee in the blend A80:R20 versus A20:R80 influenced the amounts of 20 chemical families of volatile compounds. Aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, pyrroles, pyrazines, furans, thiazoles, thiophenes, esters, oxazoles, lactones, sulphur compounds, pyridines, alkanes, alkenes, phenolic compounds, benzenic compounds, acids, pyranones and terpenes were present in higher quantities in the sample containing 80% of Arabica coffee, whereas sulphur compounds were more abundant in the coffee with 80% of Robusta. Sensory differences were also found between the two blends of coffee in the burnt, caramel, nutty, earthy and roasty notes. Torrefacto coffee, widely consumed in Spain, is obtained by roasting coffee with sugar. Higher quantities of ketones, alcohols, pyrazines, furans, pyridines, alkanes, phenolic compounds, pyranones and terpenes were found in the blend A20:R80 50% Torrefacto coffee versus A20:R80 natural roasted coffee. These differences in the volatile fraction were perceived by our panellists in the intensities of the nutty, roasty, earthy, burnt and caramel notes. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Sensory analysis; Static headspace; Torrefacto coffee; Volatile compounds","Coffea arabica; Coffea canephora; coffee; food processing; food science; sugar; volatile organic compound","","","","","","","Parliament T.H., Stahl H.D., What makes that coffee smell so good?, Chem Technol, 8, pp. 38-47, (1995); Correia A.M.N.G., A influência da torra na evoluçao dos ácidos clorogénicos do café, (1990); Bell J., Spain's great fertile ground for new ideas in coffee, Tea Coffee Trade J, 12, pp. 31-35, (2000); Vitzthum O.G., Weisemann R., Becket R., Kohler H.S., Identification of an aroma key compound in Robusta coffees, Café, Cacao, Th é, 34, pp. 27-33, (1990); Tipler A., Spragg R.A., Aries R.E., Lidiard D.P., The characterization of coffee using headspace extraction, capillary gas chromatography, selective detection systems, pattern recognition software and principal component analysis, Proceedings of the 13th International Symposium on Capillary Chromatography, pp. 337-347, (1991); Bicchi C.P., Binello A.E., Pellegrino G.M., Vanni A.C., Characterisation of roasted coffee by S-HSGC and HPLC-UV and principal component analysis, J Agric Food Chem, 41, pp. 2324-2328, (1993); Hernandez C.V., Rutledge D.N., Multivariate statistical analysis of gas chromatograms to differentiate cocoa masses by geographical origin and roasting conditions, Analyst, 119, pp. 1171-1176, (1994); Mosca A.I., Composiqao quimica do aroma do café e sua correlacçao com origem e controlo de qualidade, (1994); Liardon R., Ott U., Application of multivariate statistics for the classification of coffee headspace profiles, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 17, pp. 32-38, (1984); Kallio H., Leino M., Koullias K., Kallio S., Kaitaranta J., Headspace of roasted ground coffee as an indicator of storage time, Food Chem, 36, pp. 135-148, (1990); Shimoda M., Shibamoto T., Isolation and identification of headspace volatiles from brewed coffee with an on-column GC-MS method, J Agric Food Chem, 38, pp. 802-804, (1990); Bicchi C.P., Panero O.M., Pellegrino G.M., Vanni A.C., Characterization of roasted coffee and coffee beverages by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography and principal component analysis, J Agric Food Chem, 41, pp. 2324-2328, (1997); Pollien P., Ott A., Montigon F., Baumgartner M., Munoz-Box R., Chaintreau A., Hyphenated headspace-gas chromatography-sniffing technique: Screening of impact odorants and quantitative aromagram comparisons, J Agric Food Chem, 45, pp. 2630-2637, (1997); Mayer F., Czerny M., Grosch W., Sensory study of the character impact aroma compounds of a coffee beverage, Eur Food Res Technol, 211, pp. 272-276, (2000); Sanz C., Ansorena D., Cid C., Bello J., Optimising headspace temperature and time sampling for identification of volatile compounds in ground roasted Arabica coffee, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 1364-1369, (2001); Blank I., Sen A., Grosch W., Aroma impact compounds of Arabica and Robusta coffee.

The ecology of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial sauerkraut fermentations was investigated. Brine samples were taken from four commercial sauerkraut fermentation tanks over a 60- or 100-day period in 2000 and 2001. A total of 171 phage isolates, including at least 26 distinct phages, were obtained. In addition, 28 distinct host strains were isolated and identified as LAB by restriction analysis of the intergenic transcribed spacer region and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. These host strains included Leuconostoc, Weissella, and Lactobacillus species. It was found that there were two phage-host systems in the fermentations corresponding to the population shift from heterofermentative to homofermentative LAB between 3 and 7 days after the start of the fermentations. The data suggested that phages may play an important role in the microbial ecology and succession of LAB species in vegetable fermentations. Eight phage isolates, which were independently obtained two or more times, were further characterized. They belonged to the family Myoviridae or Siphoviridae and showed distinct host ranges and DNA fingerprints. Two of the phage isolates were found to be capable of infecting two Lactobacillus species. The results from this study demonstrated for the first time the complex phage ecology present in commercial sauerkraut fermentations, providing new insights into the bioprocess of vegetable fermentations.","","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus; Leuconostoc; Myoviridae; Siphoviridae; Weissella; Bacteria; DNA; Fermentation; RNA; Vegetable oils; ribosome RNA; Bacteriophage ecology; bacteriophage; ecology; fermentation; food science; article; bacteriophage; bioprocess; DNA fingerprinting; fermentation; host range; lactic acid bacterium; Lactobacillus; Leuconostoc; nonhuman; restriction mapping; RNA sequence; vegetable; Ecology","","","","","","","Ackermann H.-W., Frequency of morphological phage descriptions in the year 2000, Brief Rev.

The highest degree of inhibition was found in a hydrolysate obtained by 30 min of treatment with alcalase. This hydrolysate was used as starting material for the purification of ACE-inhibitory peptides. After Biogel P2 gel filtration chromatography and HPLC C18 reverse phase chromatography, four peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity were purified. Two of them were competitive inhibitors of ACE, while the other two were uncompetitive inhibitors. These results show that chickpea proteins are a good source of ACE-inhibitory peptides when hydrolysed with the protease alcalase. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","ACE inhibitors; Biological peptides; Chickpea protein hydrolysate","Cicer arietinum; food science; protein","","","","","","","Vioque J., Sanchez-Vioque R., Clemente A., Pedroche J., Yust M.M., Millan F., Bioactive peptides in storage proteins, Grasas Aceites, 51, pp. 361-365, (2000); Gardner M.L.G., Gastrointestinal absorption of intact proteins, Ann Rev Nutr, 8, pp. 329-350, (1988); Roberts P.R., Burney J.D., Black K.W., Zaloga G.P., Effect of chain length on absorption of biologically active peptides from the gastrointestinal tract, Digestion, 60, pp. 332-337, (1999); Smacchi E., Gobbetti M., Bioactive peptides in dairy products: Synthesis and interaction with proteolytic enzymes, Food Microbiol, 17, pp. 129-141, (2000); Clare D.A., Swaisgood H.E., Bioactive milk peptides: A prospectus, J Dairy Sci, 83, pp. 1187-1195, (2000); Meng Q.C., Oparil S., Purification and assay methods for angiotensin-converting enzyme, J Chromatogr A, 743, pp. 105-122, (1996); Mark K.S., Davis T.P., Stroke: Development, prevention and treatment with peptidase inhibitors, Peptides, 21, pp. 1965-1973, (2000); Fotherby M.D., Panayiotou B., Antihypertensive therapy in the prevention of stroke: What, when and for whom?, Drugs, 58, pp. 663-674, (1999); Pitt B., ACE inhibitors in heart failure: Prospects and limitations, Cardiovasc Drug Ther, 11, pp. 285-290, (1997); Varin R., Mulder P., Tamion F., Richard V., Henry J.P., Lallemand F., Lerebours G., Thuillez C., Improvement of endothelial function by chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in heart failure: Role of nitric oxide, prostanoids, oxidant stress, and bradykinin, Circulation, 102, pp. 351-356, (2000); Lever A.F., Hole D.J., Gillis C.R., McCallum I.R., McInnes G.T., McKinnon P.L., Meredith P.A., Murray L.S., Reid J.L., Robertson J.W., Do inhibitors of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme protect against risk of cancer?, Lancet, 352, pp. 179-184, (1998); Lever A.F., Hole D.J., Gillis C.R., McInnes G.T., Meredith P.A., Murray L.S., Reid J.L., Is cancer related to hypertension or to its treatment?, Clin Exp Hypertens, 21, pp. 937-946, (1999); Atkinson A.B., Robertson J.I.S., Captopril in the treatment of clinical hypertension and cardiac failure, Lancet, 2, pp. 836-839, (1979); Kim Y.K., Yoon S., Yu D.Y., Lonnerdal B., Chung B.H., Novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides derived from recombinant human α<sub>sl</sub>-casein expressed in Escherichia coli, J Dairy Res, 66, pp. 431-439, (1999); Pihlanto-Leppala A., Koskinen P., Piilola K., Tupasela T., Korhonen H., Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of whey protein digests: Concentration and characterization of active peptides, J Dairy Res, 67, pp. 53-64, (2000); Nakamura Y., Yamamoto N., Sakai K., Okubo A., Yamazaki S., Takano T., Purification and characterization of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors from sour milk, J Dairy Sci, 78, pp. 777-783, (1994); Roy M.K., Watanabe Y., Tamai Y., Yeast protease B-digested skimmed milk inhibits angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme activity, Biotechnol Appl Biochem, 31, pp. 95-100, (2000); Ryhanen E.L., Pihlanto-Leppala A., Pahkala E., A new type of ripened, low-fat cheese with bioactive properties, Int Dairy J, 11, pp. 441-447, (2001); Kim S.K., Byun H.G., Park P.J., Shahidi F., Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides purified from bovine skin gelatin hydrolysate, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 2992-2997, (2001); Hyun C.K., Shin H.K., Utilization of bovine blood plasma proteins for the production of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides, Process Biochem, 36, pp. 65-71, (2000); Matsufuji H., Matsui T., Seki E., Osajima K., Nakashima M., Osajima Y., Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides in an alkaline protease hydrolyzate derived from sardine muscle, Biosci, Biotechnol Biochem, 58, pp. 2244-2245, (1994); Matsui T., Li C.H., Tanaka T., Maki T., Osajima Y., Matsumoto K., Depressor effect of wheat germ hydrolysate and its novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide, Ile-Val-Tyr, and the metabolism in rat and human plasma, Biol Pharm Bull, 23, pp. 427-431, (2000); Yano S., Suzuki K., Funatsu G., Isolation from alpha-zein of thermolysin peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity, Biosci, Biotechnol Biochem, 60, pp. 661-663, (1996); Kim S.H., Lee Y.J., Kwon D.Y., Isolation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor from doenjang, Korean J Food Sci Technol, 31, pp. 848-854, (1999); Choi H.S., Cho H.Y., Yang H.C., Ra K.S., Suh H.J., Angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor from Grifola frondosa, Food Res Int, 34, pp. 177-182, (2001); Friedman M., Nutritional value of proteins from different food sources.

The protein - phenolic compound interaction was quantified by haze formation and colorimetric determination of total polyphenol bound. Ferulic acid, catechin and extracted phenolics (flavonoids) from condensed tannin-free sorghum did not complex kafirin. Only tannic acid and sorghum-condensed tannins had the ability to complex kafirin. The sorghum-condensed tannins interacted more strongly than tannic acid. The haze of sorghum-condensed tannins - kafirin was permanent, indicating a strong interaction. The fact that sorghum-condensed tannins can bind irreversibly to kafirin indicates that this may play a role in decreasing protein digestibility in high-tannin sorghum and can cause haze formation in lager beer made from high-tannin sorghum. However, in condensed tannin-free sorghum, phenolic compounds may not appear to play a major role in decreasing protein digestibility, as these endogenous phenolics may not bind with kafirin. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Haze; Kafirin; Phenolic compounds; Sorghum prolamin; Tannin","food science","","","","","","","Hulse J.H., Liang E.M., Pearson O.E., Sorghum and the Millets: Their Composition and Nutritive Value, pp. 81-91, (1980); Taylor J.R.N., Schussler L., The protein compositions of the different anatomical parts of sorghum grain, J Cereal Sci, 4, pp. 361-369, (1986); Murty D.S., Kumar K.A., Traditional uses of sorghum and millets, Sorghum and Millet: Chemistry and Technology, pp. 185-222, (1995); Taylor J.R.N., Effect of malting on the protein and free amino nitrogen of sorghum, J Sci Food Agric, 34, pp. 885-892, (1983); Taylor J.R.N., Boyd H.K., Free α-amino nitrogen production in sorghum beer mashing, J Sci Food Agric, 37, pp. 1109-1117, (1987); Hahn D.H., Rooney L.W., Earp C.F., Tannins and phenols in sorghum, Cereal Foods World, 29, pp. 776-779, (1984); Nip W.K., Burns E.E., Pigment characterization in grain sorghum, I, red varieties, Cereal Chem, 43, pp. 490-496, (1969); Gupta R.K., Haslam E., Plant proanthocyanidins, part 5, polyphenols, J Chem Soc Perkin Trans 1, 5, pp. 982-986, (1978); Haslam E., Lilley T.H., Warminski E., Liao H., Cai Y., Martin R., Gaffney S.H., Goulding P.N., Luck G., Polyphenol complexation, a study in molecular recognition, Phenolic Compounds in Food and their Effects on Health I, Analysis, Occurrence and Chemistry, pp. 8-50, (1992); Nguz K., Huyghebaert A., Effect of tannins concentration on in vitro protein digestibility of some African sorghum Sorghum bicolor (L Moench) varieties, Sci Aliments, 18, pp. 293-300, (1993); Nyamambi B., Ndlovu L.R., Read J.S., Reed J.D., The effects of sorghum proanthocyanidins on digestive enzyme activity in vitro and in digestive tract of chicken, J Sci Food Agric, 80, pp. 2223-2231, (2000); Butler L.G., Riedl D.J., Lebryk D.G., Blytt H.J., Interaction of proteins with sorghum tannins: Mechanism, specificity and significance, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 6, pp. 916-920, (1984); Nguz K., Van Gaver D., Huyghebaert A., In vitro inhibition of digestive enzymes by sorghum condensed tannin (Sorghum bicolor L Moench), Sci Aliments, 18, pp. 507-514, (1998); Lu Y., Bennick A., Interaction of tannin with human salivary proline-rich protein, Arch Oral Biol, 43, pp. 717-728, (1998); Taylor J.R.N., Von Benecke R., Carlsson F.H.H., Distribution, purification and N-terminal amino acid sequence of sorghum reduced soluble protein, J Cereal Sci, 9, pp. 169-177, (1989); Carter R., Reck D.R.; Hamaker B.R., Mohamed A.A., Habben J.E., Huang C.P., Larkins B.A., Efficient procedure for extracting maize and sorghum kernel proteins reveals higher prolamin contents than conventional method, Cereal Chem, 72, pp. 583-588, (1995); Taylor J.R.N., Novellie L., Liebenberg N.W., Sorghum protein body composition and ultrastructure, Cereal Chem, 61, pp. 69-73, (1984); Shull J.M., Watterson J.J., Kerleis A.W., Proposed nomenclature of the alcohol soluble proteins (kafirins) of Sorghum bicolor (L Moench) based on molecular weight, solubility and structure, J Agric Food Chem, 39, pp. 83-87, (1991); El Nour I.N.A., Peruffo A.D.B., Curioni A., Characterisation of sorghum kafirins in relation to their cross-linking behaviour, J Cereal Sci, 28, pp. 197-207, (1998); Kaluza W.Z., McGrath R.M., Roberts T.C., Shroder H.H., Separation of sorghum phenolics of Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench grain, J Agric Food Chem, 28, pp. 1191-1196, (1980); Hagerman A.E., Butler L.G., Protein precipitation method for the quantitative determination of tannins, J Agdc Food Chem, 26, pp. 809-812, (1978); Haze Determination, Beer-26, (1976); Morris T.M., The relationship between haze and the size of particles in beer, J Inst Brew, 93, pp. 13-17, (1987); Sorghum: Determination of Tannin Content, ICS:67.060, Food Technology: Cereals.

Raman spectroscopy may be used as a tool for quality control, for compositional identification or for the detection of adulteration, as well as for basic research in the elucidation of structural or conformational changes that occur during processing of foods.","","Carbohydrates; Food processing; Infrared spectroscopy; Lipids; Molecular structure; Molecular vibrations; Molecules; Photons; Pigments; Proteins; Quality control; Water; Food science; Vibrational spectroscopy; Raman spectroscopy","","","","","","","Li-Chan E., Nakai S., Hirotsuka M., Raman spectroscopy as a probe of protein structure in food systems, Protein Structure-function Relationships in Foods, pp. 163-197, (1994); Peticolas W.L., Raman spectroscopy of DNA and proteins, Methods Enzymol., 246, pp. 389-416, (1995); Wang Y., Van Wart H.E., Raman and resonance Raman spectroscopy, Methods Enzymol., 226, pp. 319-373, (1993); Mathies R.A., Biomolecular vibrational spectroscopy, Methods Enzymol., 246, pp. 377-389, (1995); Austin J.C., Rodgers K.R., Spiro T.G., Protein structure from ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy, Methods Enzymol., 226, pp. 374-396, (1993); Spiro T.B., Czernuszewicz R.S., Resonance raman spectroscopy of metalloproteins, Methods Enzymol., 246, pp. 416-460, (1995); Goral J., Zichy V., Fourier transform Raman studies of materials and compounds of biological importance, Spectrochim.

These bioactive compounds have been implicated in the reduction of degenerative human diseases, mainly due to their antioxidant potential. Orange juice is characterized by substantial accumulation (apart from ascorbic acid) of flavonoids and carotenoids. Commercial orange juice is the main human dietary source of antioxidant compounds in developed countries. The qualitative and quantitative determination of carotenoid, flavonoid and vitamin C content of Spanish commercial orange juices was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography. The health-related properties of bioactive compounds contained in orange juice are based on their antioxidant activity. The antioxidant capacity of these juices was assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl stable radical scavenging and was compared with a freshly squeezed orange juice. In addition, the relative contribution of the different bioactive compounds to the antioxidant activity of orange juices was calculated. Total vitamin C was found to be the major contributor to the antioxidant potential of the orange juices studied, followed by flavonoid and carotenoid compounds. Ascorbic acid, total vitamin C and β-cryptoxanthin content correlated positively with the free-radical scavenging parameters. No significant differences, in terms of antioxidant capacity, were found between commercial traditional pasteurized orange juices and freshly squeezed orange juice. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Antioxidant capacity; Bioactive compounds; Carotenoids; Flavonoids; Orange juice; Vitamin A; Vitamin C","food science","","","","","","","Steinmetz K.A., Potter J.D., Vegetables, fruit and cancer prevention: A review, J Am Diet Assoc, 53, pp. 536-543, (1996); Tibble D.L., Further evidence of the cardiovascular benefits of diets enriched in carotenoids, Am J Clin Nutr, 68, pp. 521-522, (1998); Slaterry M.L., Benson J., Curtin K., Ma K.-N., Schaeffer D., Potter J.D., Carotenoids and colon cancer, Am J Clin Nutr, 71, pp. 575-582, (2000); Omaye S.T., Zhang P., Phytochemical interactions: β-carotene, tocopherol and ascorbic acid, Phytochemicals, a New Paradigm, (1998); Rice-Evans C., Miller N.J., Paganga G., Structure-antioxidant activity relationships of flavonoids and phenolic acids, Free Radical Biol Med, 20, pp. 933-956, (1996); Benavente-Garcia O., Castillo J., Marin F.R., Ortuno A., Del Rio J.A., Uses and properties of citrus flavonoids, J Agric Food Chem, 45, pp. 4505-4515, (1997); Mouly P.P., Gaydou E.M., Lapierre L., Corsetti J., Differentiation of several geographical origins in single-strength Valencia orange juices using quantitative comparison of carotenoid profiles, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 4038-4045, (1999); Pupin A.M., Dennis M.J., Toledo M.C.F., HPLC analysis of carotenoids in orange juice, Food Chem, 64, pp. 269-275, (1999); Rouseff R., Raley L., Hofsommer H.-J., Application of diode array detection with a C- 30 reversed phase column for the separation and identification of saponified orange juice carotenoids, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 2176-2181, (1996); Rapisarda P., Tomaino A., Lo Cascio R., Bonina F., De Pasquale A., Saija A., Antioxidant effectiveness as influenced by phenolic content of fresh orange juices, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 4718-4723, (1999); Gil-Izquierdo A., Gil M.I., Ferreres F., Tomas-Barberan F.A., In vitro availability of flavonoids and other phenolics in orange juice, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 1035-1041, (2001); Miller N.J., Rice-Evans C.A., The relative contributions of ascorbic acid and phenolic antioxidants to the total antioxidant activity of orange and apple fruit juices and blackcurrant drink, Food Chem, 60, pp. 331-337, (1997); Wang H., Cao G., Prior R.L., Total antioxidant capacity of fruits, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 701-705, (1996); Sanchez-Moreno C., Larrauri J.A., Saura-Calixto F., Free radical scavenging capacity and inhibition of lipid oxidation of wines, grape juices and related polyphenolic constituents, Food Res Int, 32, pp. 407-412, (1999); Van Der Sluis A.A., Dekker M., Verkerk R., Jongen W.M.F., An improved, rapid in vitro method to measure antioxidant activity.

L-Methionine-γ-lyase (MGL) can convert L-methionine to methanethiol (MTL), α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia. The mgl gene encoding MGL was cloned from the type strain Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9175 known to produce copious amounts of MTL and related VSCs. The disruption of the mgl gene, achieved in strain ATCC 9175, resulted in a 62% decrease in thiol-producing activity and a 97% decrease in total VSC production in the knockout strain. Our work shows that L-methionine degradation via γ-elimination is a key step in the formation of VSCs in B. linens.","","Amino Acid Sequence; Brevibacterium; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; Cheese; Gene Deletion; Methionine; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Sulfur Compounds; Volatilization; Bacteria (microorganisms); Brevibacterium; Brevibacterium linens; Posibacteria; Amino acids; Dairy products; Degradation; Flavors; Genes; 2 oxobutyric acid; ammonia; methanethiol; methionine; methionine gamma lyase; sulfur derivative; thiol; volatile agent; food science; microbiology; article; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; Brevibacterium linens; catabolism; cheese; cloning; DNA sequence; enzymatic degradation; flavor; gene amplification; gene disruption; genetic identification; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; Knockout strains; Methanethiol (MTL); Methionine; Thiol-producing activity; Volatile sulfur compounds (VSC); Bacteria","GENBANK: AY622198","2 oxobutyric acid, 600-18-0; ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; methanethiol, 74-93-1; methionine gamma lyase, 42616-25-1; methionine, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases, EC 4.4.-; L-methionine gamma-lyase, EC 4.4.1.11; Methionine, 63-68-3; methylmercaptan, 74-93-1; Sulfhydryl Compounds, ; Sulfur Compounds, ","","","","","Alting A.C., Engels W.J.M., Van Schalkwijk S., Exterkate F.A., Purification and characterization of cystathionine β-lyase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris B78 and its possible role in flavor development in cheese, Appl.

Screening of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from human clinical cases (n = 46), foods (n = 118), and healthy animals (n = 58) in the United States revealed mutations in inlA leading to premature stop codons (PMSCs) in L. monocytogenes ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-16635A (PMSC mutation type 1), DUP-1025A and DUP-1031A (PMSC mutation type 2), and DUP-1046B and DUP-1062A (PMSC mutation type 3). While all DUP-1046B, DUP-1062A, DUP-16635A, and DUP-1031A isolates (n = 76) contained inlA PMSCs, ribotypes DUP-1052A and DUP-1025A (n = 72) contained isolates with and without inlA PMSCs. Western immunoblotting showed that all three inlA PMSCs result in the production of truncated and secreted InlA. Searches of the Pathogen Tracker database, which contains subtype and source information for more than 5,000 L. monocytogenes isolates, revealed that the six ribotypes shown to contain isolates with inlA PMSCs were overall more commonly isolated from foods than from human listeriosis cases. L. monocytogenes strains carrying inlA PMSCs also showed significantly (P = 0.0004) reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells compared to isolates with homologous 3′ InlA sequences without PMSCs. Invasion assays with an isogenic PMSC mutant further supported the observation that inlA PMSCs lead to reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells. Our data show that specific L. monocytogenes subtypes which are common among U.S. food isolates but rare among human listeriosis isolates carry inlA mutations that are associated with, and possibly at least partially responsible for, an attenuated invasion phenotype.

Despite its increasing popularity among food scientists, NMR is still an underutilized methodology in this area, mainly due to its high cost, relatively low sensitivity, and the lack of NMR expertise by many food scientists. The aim of this review is to help bridge the knowledge gap that may exist when attempting to apply NMR methodologies to the field of food science. We begin by covering the basic principles required to apply NMR to the study of foods and nutrients. A description of the discipline of chemometrics is provided, as the combination of NMR with multivariate statistical analysis is a powerful approach for addressing modern challenges in food science. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of recent and key applications in the areas of compositional analysis, food authentication, quality control, and human nutrition is provided. In addition to standard NMR techniques, more sophisticated NMR applications are also presented, although limitations, gaps, and potentials are discussed. We hope this review will help scientists gain some of the knowledge required to apply the powerful methodology of NMR to the rich and diverse field of food science. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®","chemometrics; food science; NMR spectroscopy; nutrition","Multivariant analysis; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nutrition; Quality control; Spectrum analysis; Basic principles; Chemometrics; Compositional analysis; Food authentications; Food science; Molecular levels; Multivariate statistical analysis; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","","","","","Dept. of Food Science and Technology; Food for Health Discovery Theme; Morgan Vasas","This work was supported by the Dept. of Food Science and Technology at the Ohio State Univ. and the Food for Health Discovery Theme.

Although it is generally recognized as being safe by food safety regulatory agencies, several studies have questioned its long-term safety. The purpose of this review was to survey the available literature on preclinical studies and clinical trials regarding the alleged adverse effects of MSG. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the reported possible risks that may potentially arise following chronic exposure. Preclinical studies have associated MSG administration with cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, low-grade inflammation, metabolic disarray, and premalignant alterations, along with behavioral changes. However, in reviewing the available literature, we detected several methodological flaws, which led us to conclude that these studies have limited relevance for extrapolation to dietary human intake of MSG risk exposure. Clinical trials have focused mainly on MSG effects on food intake and energy expenditure. Besides its well-known impact on food palatability, MSG enhances salivary secretion and interferes with carbohydrate metabolism, while the impact on satiety and post-meal recovery of hunger varied in relation to meal composition. Reports on MSG hypersensitivity or links of its use to increased pain sensitivity and atopic dermatitis were found to have little supporting evidence. Many of the reported negative health effects of MSG have little relevance for chronic human exposure and are poorly informative as they are based on excessive dosing that does not meet with levels normally consumed in food products. We conclude that further clinical and epidemiological studies are needed, with an appropriate design, accounting for both added and naturally occurring dietary MSG. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.","flavor enhancer;

Padre Garcia Tejero, 4, Spain","Optimization of bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus plantarum LPCO10 was explored by an integral statistical approach. In a prospective series of experiments, glucose and NaCl concentrations in the culture medium, inoculum size, aeration of the culture, and growth temperature were statistically combined using an experimental 235-2 fractional factorial two-level design and tested for their influence on maximal bacteriocin production by L. plantarum LPCO10. After the values for the less-influential variables were fixed, NaCl concentration, inoculum size, and temperature were selected to study their optimal relationship for maximal bacteriocin production. This was achieved by a new experimental 323-1 fractional factorial three-level design which was subsequently used to build response surfaces and analyzed for both linear and quadratic effects. Results obtained indicated that the best conditions for bacteriocin production were shown with temperatures ranging from 22 to 27°C, salt concentration from 2.3 to 2.5%, and L. plantarum LPCO10 inoculum size ranging from 107.3 to 107.4 CFU/ml, fixing the initial glucose concentration at 2%, with no aeration of the culture. Under these optimal conditions, about 3.2 × 104 times more bacteriocin per liter of culture medium was obtained than that used to initially purify plantaricin S from L. plantarum LPCO10 to homogeneity. These results indicated the importance of this study in obtaining maximal production of bacteriocins from L. plantarum LPCO10 so that bacteriocins can be used as preservatives in canned foods.","","Bacteriocins; Fermentation; Food Additives; Lactobacillus; Sodium Chloride; Temperature; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Posibacteria; Cell culture; Fermentation; Glucose; Optimization; Sodium chloride; bacteriocin; food additive; biotechnology; food science; microbial activity; article; bacterium culture; batch fermentation; culture medium; dairy industry; fermentation; food preservation; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus plantarum; meat industry; nonhuman; temperature; Integral statistical approach; Bacteria","","Bacteriocins, ; Food Additives, ; Sodium Chloride, 7647-14-5","","","","","Aguilar A., Biotechnology of lactic acid bacteria: An European perspective, Food Biotechnol., 5, pp. 323-330, (1991); Aymerich T., Artigas M.G., Garriga M., Monfort J.M., Hugas M., Effect of sausage ingredients and additives on the production of enterocin A and B by Enterococcus faecium CTC492.

First, this review explains the fundamentals of AFM, including principle, manipulation, and analysis. Applications of AFM are then reported in food science and technology research, including qualitative macromolecule and polymer imaging, complicated or quantitative structure analysis, molecular interaction, molecular manipulation, surface topography, and nanofood characterization. The results suggested that AFM could bring insightful knowledge on food properties, and the AFM analysis could be used to illustrate some mechanisms of property changes during processing and storage. However, the current difficulty in applying AFM to food research is lacking appropriate methodology for different food systems. Better understanding of AFM technology and developing corresponding methodology for complicated food systems would lead to a more in-depth understanding of food properties at macromolecular levels and enlarge their applications. The AFM results could greatly improve the food processing and storage technologies. © 2007 Institute of Food Technologists.","Atomic force microscopy (AFM); Food science; Macromolecule; Microstructure; Nanotechnology","Food Analysis; Food Technology; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Nanotechnology; atomic force microscopy; evaluation; food analysis; food handling; methodology; nanotechnology; short survey","","","","","","","Adams E.L., Kroon P.A., Williamson G., Morris V.J., Characterisation of heterogeneous arabinoxylans by direct imaging of individual molecules by atomic force microscopy, Carbohydr Res, 338, pp. 771-80, (2003); Adams E.L., Kroon P.A., Williamson G., Gilbert H.J., Morris V.J., Inactivated enzymes as probes of the structure of arabinoxylans as observed by atomic force microscopy, Carbohydr Res, 339, pp. 579-90, (2004); Adams E.L., Kroon P.A., Williamson G., Morris V.J., AFM studies of water-soluble wheat arabinoxylans - Effects of esterase treatment, Carbohydr Res, 340, pp. 1841-5, (2005); (1997); An H., Guo Y., Zhang X., Zhang Y., Hu J., Nanodissection of single- and double-stranded DNA by atomic force microscopy, J Nanosci Nanotechnol, 5, pp. 1656-9, (2005); Arnaudov L.N., De Vries R., Ippel H., Van Mierlo C.P., Multiple steps during the formation of β-lactoglobulin fibrils, Biomacromolecules, 4, pp. 1614-22, (2003); Braga P.C., Ricci D., Atomic Force Microscopy: Biomedical Methods and Applications., (2004); Butz P., Hofmann C., Tauscher B., Recent development in noninvasive techniques for fresh fruit and vegetable internal quality analysis, J Food Sci, 70, pp. 131-41, (2005); Caillet A., Cogne C., Andrieu J., Laulent P., Rivoire A., Characterization of ice cream structure by direct optical microscopy.

There are many semiconductor combinations that are used but the most popular and widely used consist of a CdSe core and can be functionalized in different ways when coated with polymers. Their application in Biological sciences has been widespread but few articles report the use of quantum dots in Food Science. The results obtained so far in limited applications show a promising future. In Food Science, they have been used mostly to detect pathogenic bacteria, and proteins. The applications in biological sciences are reviewed since they constitute a path of applications that can be emulated in other fields and the initial uses in Food Science are reviewed to encourage others in the field to take a closer look and benefit from the opportunities offered. Limitations and opportunities in the methods used in Food Science are discussed in order to simplify the work for researchers interested in using quantum dots as markers. The two methods used to attach quantum dots to bacteria and proteins in Food Science were broadly used previously in biological systems. The aim of this review is to show how quantum dots have been used in Food Science, and enhance their use. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Binding; Crosslinking; Fluorescence; Imaging; Inorganic dyes; Quantum dots","Bacteria; Biology; Crosslinking; Fluorescence; Imaging techniques; Nanocrystals; Proteins; Binding; Biological science; Fluorescent nanoparticles; Food science; Functionalized; Inorganic semiconductors; Pathogenic bacterium; Semiconductor quantum dots","","","","","","","Abdullah-Al-Nahain, Lee J.-E., In I., Lee H., Lee K.D., Jeong J.H., Et al., Target delivery and cell imaging using hyaluronic acid-functionalized graphene quantum dots, Molecular Pharmaceutics, 10, pp. 3736-3744, (2013); Agrawal A., Tripp R.A., Anderson L.J., Nie S., Real-time detection of virus particles and viral protein expression with two-color nanoparticle probes, Journal of Virology, 79, pp. 8625-8628, (2005); Akerman M.E., Chan W.C.W., Laakkonen P., Bhatia S.N., Ruoslahti E., Nanocrystal targeting in vivo, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99, pp. 12617-12621, (2002); Alivisatos A.P., Semiconductor clusters, nanocrystals, and quantum dots, Science, 271, pp. 933-937, (1996); Ansari S., Bozkurt F., Yazar G., Ryan V., Bhunia A., Kokini J., Probing the distribution of gliadin proteins in dough and baked bread using conjugated quantum dots as a labeling tool, Journal of Cereal Science, 63, pp. 41-48, (2015); Ballou B., Lagerholm B.C., Ernst L.A., Bruchez M.P., Waggoner A.S., Noninvasive imaging of quantum dots in mice, Bioconjugate Chemistry, 15, pp. 79-86, (2004); Bang J.H., Kamat P.V., Quantum dot sensitized solar cells.

In this study, we analyzed 70 Cronobacter isolates from powdered infant formula (PIF) and an infant formula production facility in China to determine possible contamination routes. The strains were profiled by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR-based O-antigen serotyping, and ompA and rpoB sequence analyses. The isolates were primarily Cronobacter sakazakii (66/70) or Cronobacter malonaticus (4/70). The strains were divided into 38 pulsotypes (PTs) using PFGE and 19 sequence types (STs) by MLST. In contrast, rpoB and ompA sequence analyses divided the strains into 10 overlapping clusters each. PCR serotyping of the 66 C. sakazakii and 4 C. malonaticus strains resulted in the identification of four C. sakazakii serotypes (O1, O2, O4, and O7) and a single C. malonaticus serotype, O2. The dominant C. sakazakii sequence types from PIF and an infant formula production factory in China were C. sakazakii clonal complex 4 (CC4) (n=19), ST1 (n=14), and ST64 (n=11). C. sakazakii CC4 is a clonal lineage strongly associated with neonatal meningitis. In the process of manufacturing PIF, the spray-drying, fluidized-bed-drying, and packing areas were the main areas with Cronobacter contamination. C. sakazakii strains with the same pulsotypes (PT3 and PT2) and sequence types (ST1 and ST64) were isolated both from processing equipment and from the PIF finished product. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.","","Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins;

The U.S. Nutrition Facts panel includes information on total sugars in foods. A focus on added sugars is linked to the concept of discretionary calories and decreasing consumption of added sugars or free sugars as a means to assist a consumer to identify foods that are nutrient-dense. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed that including ""added sugars"" declaration on the Nutrition Facts panel would be another tool to help consumers reduce excessive discretionary calorie intake from added sugars. Through deductive reasoning, labeling added sugars is one tactic to potentially curb the obesity epidemic in the United States. This review discusses the functions of sugar in food and shows that the methods used to replace added sugars in foods can result in no reduction in calorie content or improvement in nutrient density. Without clear benefit to the consumer for added sugars labeling, this review highlights the complex business obstacles, costs, and consumer confusion resulting from the proposed rule. © 2015 Institute of Food Technologists.","Food labeling; Nutrition facts; Public health; Sucrose; Sugars","Nutrients; Nutrition; Public health; Sugar (sucrose); Deductive reasoning; Food and Drug Administration; Food science; Free sugar; NO reduction; Total sugars; Sugars","","","","","","","Food labeling: revision of the nutrition and supplement facts labels, (2014); Nutrition basics-sugar, (2014); BeMiller J.N., Carbohydrate analysis, Food analysis, pp. 150-154, (2003); Bullock L.M., Handel A.P., Segall S., Wasserman P.A., Replacement of simple sugars in cookie dough, Food Technol, 1, pp. 82-86, (1992); Carakostas M., Prakash I., Kinghorn A.D., Wu C.D., Soejarto D.D., Steviol glycosides, pp. 159-180, (2012); Danehy J., Wolnak B., Maillard technology: manufacturing applications in food products, The Maillard reaction in foods and nutrition, pp. 303-315, (1983); Deis R.C., Maltitol syrups and polyglycitols, Alternative sweeteners, pp. 265-275, (2012); Dotsch M., Busch J., Batenburg M., Liem G., Tareilus E., Mueller R., Meijer G., Strategies to reduce sodium consumption: a food industry perspective, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 49, pp. 841-851, (2009); Farnworth E., Mainville I., Desjardins M., Gardner N., Fliss I., Champagne C., Growth of probiotic bacteria and bifidobacteria in a soy yogurt formulation, Int J Food Microbiol, 116, pp. 174-181, (2007); Finkelstein E., Trogdon J.G., Cohen J.W., Dietz W., Annual medical spending attributable to obesity: payer- and service-specific estimates, Health Aff, 28, pp. w822-w831, (2009); Food labeling: Nutrient content claims, general principles, petitions, definition of terms, Definitions of nutrient content claims for the fat, fatty acid, and cholesterol content of food, (1993); (2014); Food labeling: Revision of the nutrition and supplement facts labels, 79 Fed.

Two independent methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant potential of total fruit extracts. The antioxidant activities of the fruits ranged from 1 to 47 μmol Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) g-1 fresh weight and from 0.3 to 34micro/mol g fresh weight (FRAP) g-1 fresh weight. Total phenolics in the fruits ranged from 118 to 5638 μg g-1 fresh weight, proanthocyanidins from 7 to 2561 μg g-1 fresh weight, flavonoids from 21 to 712 μg g-1 fresh weight and vitamin C content from 8 to 1426 μg g-1 fresh weight. There were strong correlations between antioxidant activity (assessed by both TEAC and FRAP) and total phenolics and proanthocyanidins. Flavonoids seemed to contribute less to the antioxidant potential of the fruits, while very poor correlations were observed between ascorbate content and antioxidant activity. The highest antioxidant capacities were observed in red and yellow Psidium cattleianum Sabine 'Chinese guava', sweet and acid Averrhoa carambola L 'starfruit', Syzygium cumini L Skeels 'jamblon' and white Psidium guajava L 'guava'. These fruits were also characterised by high levels of total phenolics.

To date, no molecular detection or identification system for gram-negative histamine-producing bacteria has been developed. A molecular method that allows the rapid detection of gram-negative histamine producers by PCR and simultaneous differentiation by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using the amplification product of the histidine decarboxylase genes (hdc) was developed. A collection of 37 strains of histamine-producing bacteria (8 reference strains from culture collections and 29 isolates from fish) and 470 strains of non-histamineproducing bacteria isolated from fish were tested. Histamine production of bacteria was determined by paper chromatography and confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Among 37 strains of histamineproducing bacteria, all histidine-decarboxylating gram-negative bacteria produced a PCR product, except for a strain of Citrobacter braakii. In contrast, none of the non-histamine-producing strains (470 strains) produced an amplification product. Specificity of the amplification was further confirmed by sequencing the 0.7-kbp amplification product. A phylogenetic tree of the isolates constructed using newly determined sequences of partial hdc was similar to the phylogenetic tree generated from 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. Histamine accumulation occurred when PCR amplification of hdc was positive in all of fish samples tested and the presence of powerful histamine producers was confirmed by subsequent SSCP identification. The potential application of the PCR-SSCP method as a rapid monitoring tool is discussed.","","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Bacterial; Fishes; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Food Poisoning; Genes, Bacterial; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Histamine; Histidine Decarboxylase; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Citrobacter; Citrobacter braakii; Enterobacter aerogenes; Enterobacter amnigenus; Erwinia; Hafnia alvei; Klebsiella; Morganella morganii; Negibacteria; Photobacterium; Photobacterium damselae; Photobacterium phosphoreum; Prokaryota; Proteus vulgaris; Raoultella planticola; Bacteria; Chromatography; Cloning; Genes; bacterial DNA; histamine; histidine decarboxylase; ribosome DNA; bacterium; food science; microbiology; animal tissue; article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium detection; bacterium identification; Citrobacter; controlled study; Enterobacter aerogenes; Enterobacter amnigenus; Erwinia; fish; gene amplification; gene sequence; Gram negative bacterium; Hafnia alvei; high performance liquid chromatography; Klebsiella; Klebsiella planticola; molecular biology; molecular cloning; Morganella morganii; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; paper chromatography; Photobacterium; Photobacterium damselae; Photobacterium phosphoreum; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; Proteus vulgaris; single strand conformation polymorphism; Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP); Microbiology","GENBANK: AB083200, AB083201, AB083202, AB083203, AB083204, AB083205, AB083206, AB083208, AB084250, AB084251, AB084252, AB089243, AB089244, AB089245, AB089246, AB099400, AB099401, AB099402, AB099403, AB099404, AB099405, AB099406, AB099407, J02577, M62745, M62746","histamine, 51-45-6, 56-92-8, 93443-21-1; histidine decarboxylase, 9024-61-7; DNA, Bacterial, ; Histamine, 51-45-6; Histidine Decarboxylase, EC 4.1.1.22","","","","","Akkermans A.D.L., Mirza M.S., Harmsen H.J.M., Blok H.J., Heron P.R., Sessitsch A., Akkerlnans W.M., Molecular ecology of microbes: Review of promises, pitfalls, and true progress, FEMS Microbiol.

Protein extractability and hydrophobicity and the amino acid contents of soluble and insoluble proteins, as well as formaldehyde formation, were investigated in matching pairs of cod and haddock fillets stored at -10 and -30°C (control). Formaldehyde production in cod was much higher (845 and 1065nmolg-1 at 20 and 30 weeks respectively) than in haddock (93 and 101nmolg-1 after 20 and 30 weeks respectively) at -10°C. However, a rapid decrease in solubility of proteins, increase in hydrophobiclty and decrease in the amino acid content of salt-soluble proteins at -10 compared with -30°C were observed in both species. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the nature of the protein changes between these two species, thus indicating that factors other than formaldehyde were involved in the denaturation of proteins and the formation of aggregates during frozen storage of cod and haddock fillets, especially at -10°C. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Amino acids; Cod; Fish fillets; Formaldehyde formation; Frozen storage; Haddock; Protein extractability; Protein hydrophobicity","Gadus morhua; Melanogrammus aeglefinus; fish; food science","","","","","","","Connell J., Changes in the actin of cod flesh during storage at -14°C, J Sci Food Agric, 11, pp. 515-519, (1960); Mackie I.M., The effects of freezing on flesh proteins, Food Rev Int, 9, pp. 575-610, (1993); Howell N.K., Protein-protein interactions, Biochemistry of Food Proteins, pp. 35-74, (1992); Matsumoto J.J., Noguchi S.F., Crystallization of protein in surimi, Surimi Technology, pp. 357-388, (1992); Miyauchi D., Drip formation in fish. 1: A review of factors affecting drip, Fishery Ind Res, 2, (1963); Connell J.J., The role of formaldehyde as a protein cross-linking agent acting during frozen storage of cod, J Sci Food Agric, 26, pp. 925-1929, (1975); Howell N.K., Interactions of proteins with selected small molecules, Ingredient Interactions Effect on Food Quality, pp. 269-294, (1995); Hsieh Y.L., Regenstein J.M., Texture changes of frozen stored cod and ocean perch minces, J Food Sci, 54, pp. 824-826, (1989); Shenouda S.Y.K., Theories of protein denaturation during frozen storage of fish flesh, Advances in Food Research, 26, pp. 275-311, (1980); German J.B., Kinsella J.E., Lipid oxidation in fish tissue.

Variation in ORAC, TPH, ACY, HCA, FLA and fruit weight among genotypes was much greater than that observed between growing seasons, indicating that genetics plays a more important role than growing season in influencing ORAC and phenolic content in blueberries. Significant main effects for growing season and genotype x growing season observed for ORAC, ACY, HCA and fruit weight demonstrate that environmental growing conditions can impact levels of phenolics and ORAC in blueberries and that certain genotypes vary in their capacity to synthesise phenolics under different growing conditions. In general, genotypes with smaller berries had higher ORAC values and levels of TPH, ACY, HCA and FLA than large-berried genotypes. Over both growing seasons, ORAC correlated highly with TPH, ACY, HCA and FLA, while fruit weight correlated inversely with all phenolics measured. Our results indicate that blueberry genotypes should be screened over multiple growing seasons in order to identify antioxidant- and phenolic-rich germplasm. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Anthocyanins; Blueberries; Flavonols; Harvest season; Hydroxycinnamic acids; ORAC; Phenolics","Vaccinium; antioxidant; food science; fruit; phenolic compound","","","","","","","Steinmetz K.A., Potter J.D., Vegetables, fruit and cancer.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on selected physical properties of glycerin-plasticized soy protein isolate (SPI) films. Films were cast from heated (70°C for 20 min), alkaline (pH 10) aqueous solutions of SPI (5 g/100 ml water), glycerin (50% w/w of SPI), and SDS (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40% w/w of SPI). Tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (E), moisture content (MC), total soluble matter (TSM), water vapor permeability (WVP), and color values (L, a, and b) were determined after conditioning film specimens at 25°C and 50% relative humidity (RH) for 2 days. SDS reduced (P < 0.05) film TS by as much as 43% for films with 40% SDS (6.2 vs. 10.9 MPa for control SPI films). In contrast, film E increased (P < 0.05) notably with addition of SDS even at 5%. Films with SDS had smaller (P < 0.05) MC and larger (P < 0.05) TSM values than control SPI films. Films containing 10% or more SDS had lower WVP values than control SPI films by as much as 50%. Increased yellowness, evidenced by greater (P < 0.05) + b color values, was noted for films with high amounts (20, 30, or 40%) of SDS. Changes in tensile, solubility, and water vapor barrier properties of SPI films due to the addition of SDS were largely attributed to disruption of hydrophobic associations among neighboring protein molecules as the non-polar portions of the SDS molecules attached onto hydrophobic amino acid residues within the film structure. It was demonstrated that adding anionic surfactant SDS to film-forming solutions prior to casting could greatly modify the properties of SPI films. In particular, SDS improved the water vapor barrier ability and the extendibility of SPI films, both desirable attributes when assessing the potential of such films for packaging applications. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Stimulus-responsive hydrogels are particularly effective. Stimulus-responsive hydrogels can respond to the external environment (including light, pH, temperature, electricity, etc.), thus conducting and controlling material properties. In recent years, stimulus-response hydrogel has become a hot-spot. However, there are limited applications of stimulus-responsive hydrogel in food field, which needs to be further explored. This review identified and discussed a variety of response methods that have been developed, including temperature, pH, chemical, optical, electrical and other responsive hydrogels.

A positive correlation was found between seed weight and water hydration capacity. The Peleg model, which was modified, could be used to describe the water absorption characteristics of peas and could be used to predict the rate of water absorption in the initial water absorption period. Cooking time could be measured objectively using the Mattson cooker. Cooking time was found to decrease with an increase in water hydration capacity. Hardness of cooked peas, measured using a texture analyser, was negatively correlated with both seed weight and water hydration capacity. Seed coats had a significant effect on water hydration and cooking quality of peas. Peas with relatively thin seed coats exhibited higher water hydration capacity, shorter cooking times and softer texture after cooking. The effects of soaking and cooking on trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) and oligosaccharide levels in peas were also studied. Cooking was more effective than soaking in reducing TIA levels and oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose and verbascose) in peas. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Cooking quality; Oligosaccharides; Peas (Pisum sativum); Physicochemical properties; Texture","Lathyrus aphaca; Pisum sativum; Sativum; food science; legume; physicochemical property","","","","","","","Stanley D.W., Aguilera J.M., A review of textural defects in cooked reconstituted legumes - The influence of structure and composition, J Food Biochem, 9, pp. 277-323, (1985); Gubbels G.H., Chubey B.B., Ali-Khan S.T., Stauvers M., Cooking quality of field pea matured under various environmental conditions, Can J Plant Sci, 65, pp. 55-61, (1985); Gubbels G.H., Ali-Khan S.T., Effect of seed quality on cooking quality and yield of a subsequent crop of field pea, Can J Plant Sci, 71, pp. 857-859, (1991); Bishnoi S., Khetarpaul N., Variability in physico-chemical properties and nutrient composition of different pea cultivars, Food Chem, 47, pp. 371-373, (1993); Sefa-Dedeh S., Stanley D.W., The relationship of microstructure of cowpeas to water absorption and dehulling properties, Cereal Chem, 56, pp. 379-386, (1979); Hoff J.E., Nelson P.E., An investigation of accelerated water-uptake in dry pea beans, Indiana Agric Exp Sta Res Prog Rep, (1965); Sefa-Dedeh S., Stanley D.W., Voisey P.W., Effect of storage time and cooking conditions on the hard-to-cook defect in cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata), J Food Sci, 44, pp. 790-796, (1978); Bourne M.C., Food Texture and Viscosity: Concept and Measurement, (1982); Vindiola O.L., Seib P.A., Hoseney R.C., Accelerated development of the hard-to-cook state in beans, Cereal Foods World, 31, pp. 538-552, (1986); Jood S., Mehta U., Singh R., Bhat C.M., Effect of processing on flatus producing factors in legumes, J Agric Food Chem, 33, pp. 268-271, (1985); Ayyagari R., Rao B.S., Roy D.N., Lectins, trypsin inhibitors, BOAA and tannins in legumes and cereals and the effects of processing, Food Chem, 34, pp. 229-238, (1989); Wang N., Lewis M.J., Brennan J.G., Westby A., Effect of processing methods on nutrients and anti-nutritional factors in cowpea, Food Chem, 58, pp. 59-68, (1997); Moscoso W., Bourne M.C., Hood L.F., Relationships between the hard-to-cook phenomenon in red kidney beans and water absorption, puncture force, pectin, phytic acid, and minerals, J Food Sci, 49, pp. 1577-1583, (1984); Walker A.F., Kochhar N., Effect of processing including domestic cooking on nutritional quality of legumes, Proc Nutr Soc, 41, pp. 41-51, (1982); Black R.G., Singh U., Meares C., Effect of genotype and pretreatment of field peas (Pisum sativum) on their dehulling and cooking quality, J Sci Food Agric, 77, pp. 251-258, (1998); Mattson S., The cookability of yellow peas: A colloid-chemical and biochemical study, Acta Agric Suecana, 2, pp. 185-231, (1946); Jackson G.M., Varriano-Marston E., Hard-to-cook phenomenon in beans: Effect of accelerated storage on water absorption and cooking time, J Food Sci, 46, pp. 799-803, (1981); Burr H.K., Kon S., Morris H.J., Cooking rates of dry beans as influenced by moisture content and temperature and time of storage, Food Technol, 22, pp. 336-338, (1968); Hsieh H.M., Pomeranz Y., Swanson B.G., Composition, cooking time, and maturation of adzuki (Vigna angularis) and common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), Cereal Chem, 69, pp. 244-248, (1993); Proctor J.P., Watts B., Development of a modified Mattson bean cooker procedure based on sensory panel cookability evaluation, Can Inst Food Sci Technol J, 20, pp. 9-14, (1987); Peleg M., An empirical model for the description of moisture sorption curves, J Food Sci, 53, pp. 1216-1219, (1988); SAS User's Guide: Statistics, Version 5 Edition, (1995); Wang N., Brennan J.G., Moisture sorption isotherm characteristics of potatoes at four temperatures, J Food Eng, 14, pp. 269-287, (1991); Shahin M.A., Symons S.J., Lentil seed size distribution with machine vision, ASAE Paper 01-3058, (2001); Approved Methods of the AACC, 9th Edn., (1995); Smith C., Megen W.V., Twaalfhoven L., Hitchcock C., The determination of trypsin inhibitor levels in foodstuffs, J Sci Food Agric, 31, pp. 321-350, (1980); Chiang B.Y., Johnson J.A., Measurement of total and gelatinized starch by glucoamylase and o-toluidine reagent, Cereal Chem, 54, pp. 429-435, (1977); Holm J., Bjorck I., Drews A., Lund N.G.A., A rapid method for the analysis of starch, Starch/Starke, 38, pp. 224-226, (1986); Rockland L.B., Jones F.T., Scanning electron microscope studies on dry beans.

In the recent decade, electrospun nanofibres have been applied to different potential fields such as filtration, wound dressing, drug delivery, etc. and a significant number of review papers have been published in these fields. However, the use of electrospun nanofibres in agriculture is comparatively novel and is still in its infancy. In this paper, the specific applications of electrospun nanofibres in agriculture and food science, including plant protection using pheromone-loaded nanofibres, plant protection using encapsulation of biocontrol agents, preparation of protective clothes for farm workers, encapsulation of agrochemical materials, deoxyribonucleic acid extraction in agricultural research studies, pre-concentration and measurement of pesticides in crops and environmental samples, preparation of nanobiosensors for pesticide detection, encapsulation of food materials, fabrication of food packaging materials, and filtration of beverage products are reviewed and discussed.

Mickiewicza 30, Poland","Water sorption on foodstuffs is very important in different areas of food science engineering. However, usually measured range of relative humidity covers only two of three stages of water sorption mechanism i.e. polymolecular sorption and capillary condensation. Since in this range different water sorption models can fit the experimental data well it is hard to decide which model is the most correct. In this study the results of water sorption isotherms measured from low humidity levels on marjoram, dill, granulated garlic, semolina, skim milk powder and ground coffee are reported. They are fitted by the most popular models applied in food science (i.e. proposed by: Halsey, Lewicki, Henderson, Chung and Pfost, Ferro Fontan et al. and Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer (GAB)). We also extend the study to the newest models successfully applied in food engineering, i.e. the generalized D'Arcy and Watt model (GDW) and the approach of the cooperative multimolecular sorption (CMMS). Finally, we discuss the limits of the models at low humidity levels, the possibility of reduction to Henry's law and we show the advantages and disadvantages of all approaches. It is concluded that among studied models the GDW equation seems to be the best for description of data in the whole range of relative humidity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Unsubstituted xylan was not fermented by any of the probiotic bacteria examined. However, many Bifidobacterium species and Lactobacillus brevis were able to grow to high yields using XOS. XOS were also efficiently fermented by some Bacteroides isolates but not by E coli, enterococci, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens or by the majority of intestinal Lactobacillus species examined. Bifidobacterium longum strains were able to grow well using arabinoxylan as the sole carbon source. These organisms hydrolysed and fermented the arabinosyl residues from arabinoxylan but did not substantially utilise the xylan backbone of the polysaccharide. Arabinoxylan was not fermented by lactobacilli, enterococci, E coli, C perfringens or C difficile and has potential to be an applicable carbohydrate to complement probiotic Bif longum strains in synbiotic combinations. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","β-glucan; Arabinoxylan; Cereal; Dietary fibre; Fermentation; Intestine; Prebiotic; Probiotic; Synbiotic; Xylan; Xylo-oligosaccharides","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Bifidobacterium; Bifidobacterium longum; Clostridium; Clostridium beijerinckii; Clostridium difficile; Clostridium perfringens; Enterococcus; Escherichia coli; Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus brevis; bacterium; cereal; food science","","","","","","","Bingham S.A., Mechanisms and experimental and epidemiological evidence relating dietary fibre (non-starch polysaccharides) and starch to protection against large bowel cancer, Proc Nutr Soc, 49, pp. 153-171, (1990); Hill M.J., Cereals, cereal fibre and colorectal cancer risk: A review of the epidemiological literature, Eur J Cancer Prevent, 6, pp. 219-225, (1997); Faivre J., Giacosa A., Primary prevention of colorectal cancer through fibre supplementation, Eur J Cancer Prevent, 7, SUPPL. 2, (1998); Kritchevsky D., Cereal fibres and colorectal cancer: A search for mechanisms, Eur J Cancer Prevent, 7, SUPPL. 2, (1998); Rieger M.A., Parlesak A., Pool-Zobel B.L., Rechkemmer G., Bode C., A diet high in fat and meat but low in dietary fibre increases the genotoxic potential of 'faecal water, Carcinogenesis, 20, pp. 2311-2316, (1999); D'Argenio G., Mazzacca G., Short-chain fatty acid in the human colon.

We made repeated contacts between pieces of meat and various surfaces (stainless steel and conveyor belt materials [polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane]), which were conditioned with meat exudate and then were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus sciuri, Pseudomonas putida, or Comamonas sp. Attachment strengths were assessed by the slopes of the two-phase curves obtained by plotting the logarithm of the number of microorganisms transferred against the order number of the contact. These curves were also used to estimate the microbial population on the surface by using the equation of A. Veulemans, E. Jacqmain, and D. Jacqmain (Rev. Ferment. Ind. Aliment. 25:58-65, 1970). The biofilms were characterized according to their physicochemical surface properties and structures. Their exopolysaccharide-producing capacities were assessed from biofilms grown on polystyrene. The L. monocytogenes biofilms attached more strongly to polymers than did the other strains, and attachment strength proved to be weaker on stainless steel than on the two polymers. However, in most cases, it was the population of the biofilms that had the strongest influence on the total number of CFU detached. Although attachment strengths were weaker on stainless steel, this material, carrying a smaller population of bacteria, had a weaker contaminating capacity. In most cases the equation of Veulemans et al. revealed more bacteria than did swabbing the biofilms, and it provided a better assessment of the contaminating potential of the polymeric materials studied here.","","Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Adhesion; Biofilms; Cattle; Colony Count, Microbial; Listeria monocytogenes; Meat; Polymers; Polysaccharides; Stainless Steel; Surface Properties; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos taurus; Comamonas; Comamonas sp.; Listeria; Listeria monocytogenes; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas putida; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus sciuri; Bacteria; Belt conveyors; Biofilms; Meats; Polystyrenes; Polyurethanes; Polyvinyl chlorides; Stainless steel; bacterial polysaccharide; polymer; polyurethan; polyvinylchloride; stainless steel; food science; microbiology; article; beef cattle; biofilm; Comamonas; food contamination; Listeria monocytogenes; materials; materials testing; meat; microorganism; nonhuman; Pseudomonas putida; Staphylococcus sciuri; Contaminated surfaces; Microbiology","","Polymers, ; Polysaccharides, ; Stainless Steel, 12597-68-1","","","","","Allison D.G., Sutherland I.W., The role of exopolysaccharides in adhesion of freshwater bacteria, J.

Results indicate that the fat content of olive flesh at harvest was not affected by irrigation, although olives from the most heavily irrigated treatment reached their final fat content (dry weight) earlier than those from other irrigation treatments. PAL activity and phenolic content, expressed on a dry weight basis, decreased during fruit development and were affected by irrigation, being lowered as the water supplied increased. Good correlations were established between PAL enzymatic activity and the polyphenol and ortho-diphenol contents of olive flesh, indicating that PAL is involved in the phenolic metabolism of olive fruit. The phenolic content of the oil depends on the PAL activity in the fruit, which varies 0with changes in water status. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Arbequina cultivar; Irrigation; L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; Olive fruit; Phenolic compounds","Olea europaea; Oleaceae; food production; food science; fruit; irrigation","","","","","","","Ames B.N., Shigenaga M.K., Hagen T.M., Oxidants, anti-oxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 90, pp. 7915-7922, (1993); Manson J.E., Gaziano J.M., Jonsa M.A., Hennekens C.H., Anti-oxidants and cardiovascular disease: A review, J Am College Nutr, 12, pp. 426-432, (1993); Galli C., Visioli F., Antioxidant and other activities of phenolics in olives/olive oil, typical components of the Mediterranean diet, Lipids, 34, (1999); Rice-Evans C.A., Miller N.J., Bolwell P.G., Bramley P.M., Pridham J.B., The relative antioxidant activities of plant-derived polyphenolic flavonoids, Free Radical Res, 22, pp. 375-383, (1995); Macheix J.J., Fleuriet A., Billot J., Fruit Phenolics, (1990); Panizzi L., Scarpati M.L., Oriente E.G., Structure of oleuropein, bitter glycoside with hypotensive action of olive oil.

A cheese mixed starter culture containing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis UL719 was selected for high-level nisin Z and acid production. Experimental cheddar cheeses were produced on a pilot scale, using the selected starter culture, from milk with added L. innocua (105 to 106 CFU/ml). Liposomes with purified nisin Z were prepared from proliposome H and added to cheese milk prior to renneting to give a final concentration of 300 IU/g of cheese. The nisin Z-producing strain and nisin Z-containing liposomes did not significantly affect cheese production and gross chemical composition of the cheeses. Immediately after cheese production, 3- and 1.5-log-unit reductions in viable counts of L. innocua were obtained in cheeses with encapsulated nisin and the nisinogenic starter, respectively. After 6 months, cheeses made with encapsulated nisin contained less than 10 CFU of L. innocua per g and 90% of the initial nisin activity, compared with 104 CFU/g and only 12% of initial activity in cheeses made with the nisinogenic starter. This study showed that encapsulation of nisin Z in liposomes can provide a powerful tool to improve nisin stability and inhibitory action in the cheese matrix while protecting the cheese starter from the detrimental action of nisin during cheese production.","","Cheese; Colony Count, Microbial; Culture Media; Fermentation; Food Microbiology; Lactococcus lactis; Liposomes; Listeria; Microscopy, Electron; Nisin; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactococcus; Lactococcus lactis; Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis; Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis; Listeria; Listeria innocua; Posibacteria; Streptococcus; Dairy products; Encapsulation; Enzyme inhibition; nisin; nisin z; unclassified drug; bacterium; food science; microbiology; article; bacterial count; cheese; cheesemaking; chemical composition; colony forming unit; Lactococcus lactis; Listeria innocua; mixed cell culture; nonhuman; Mixed culture; Microorganisms","","Culture Media, ; Liposomes, ; nisin Z, 137061-46-2; Nisin, 1414-45-5","","","","","Abad A., Cease K.R., Blanchette R.A., A rapid technique using epoxy resin Quetol 651 to prepare woody plant tissue for ultrastructural study, Can.

T6G 2P5, Canada","The possible origin of beef contamination and genetic diversity of Escherichia coli populations in beef cattle, on carcasses and ground beef, was examined by using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the fliC gene. E. coli was recovered from the feces of 10 beef cattle during pasture grazing and feedlot finishing and from hides, carcasses, and ground beef after slaughter. The 1,403 E. coli isolates (855 fecal, 320 hide, 153 carcass, and 75 ground beef) were grouped into 121 genetic subtypes by using the RAPD method. Some of the genetic subtypes in cattle feces were also recovered from hides, prechilled carcasses, chilled carcasses, and ground beef. E. coli genetic subtypes were shared among cattle at all sample times, but a number of transient types were unique to individual animals. The genetic diversity of the E. coli population changed over time within individual animals grazing on pasture and in the feedlot. Isolates from one animal (59 fecal, 30 hide, 19 carcass, and 12 ground beef) were characterized by the PCR-RFLP analysis of the fliC gene and were grouped into eight genotypes. There was good agreement between the results obtained with the RAPD and PCR-RFLP techniques. In conclusion, the E. coli contaminating meat can originate from cattle feces, and the E. coli population in beef cattle was highly diverse. Also, genetic subtypes can be shared among animals or can be unique to an animal, and they are constantly changing.","","Animals; Cattle; Colony Count, Microbial; Escherichia coli; Feces; Female; Flagellin; Food Microbiology; Genes, Bacterial; Genotype; Male; Meat; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique; Skin; Variation (Genetics); Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bos taurus; Enterobacter; Escherichia coli; Negibacteria; Contamination; Escherichia coli; Meats; cattle; food science; genetic variation; microbiology; animal tissue; article; bacterial gene; bacterium contamination; bacterium isolate; beef cattle; carcass; comparative study; Enterobacter infection; Escherichia coli; feces analysis; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype; grazing; nonhuman; pasture; polymerase chain reaction; random amplified polymorphic DNA; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sample; time; Genetic diversity; Genes","","Flagellin, 12777-81-0","","","","","Akiba M., Sameshima T., Nakazawa M., The shift of genetic subtypes of Escherichia coil O157:H7 isolates from cattle, Epidemiol.

Traditional methods including the peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and a reverse phase HPLC method were used to determine the primary and secondary lipid oxidation products. All tests showed an increase in lipid oxidation products with storage time and at a higher storage temperature of -20°C compared with samples stored at -30°C. Antioxidants had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on the inhibition of lipid oxidation, as shown by the reduction in peroxide value and hydroxides, and malondialdehyde formation. Similarly, deterioration of protein structure and functionality in mackerel stored for 3, 6, 12 and 24 months was greater at -20 than -30°C. ATPase activity in the myosin extract of Atlantic mackerel showed a significant decrease (P < 0.01) with progressive frozen storage. Protein solubility in high salt concentration (0.6M NaCl) decreased (P < 0.01) during storage at both -20 and -30°C but was greater at -20°C. Interestingly, antioxidants BHT, vitamin C and vitamin E protected the proteins against complete loss of ATPase activity and protein solubility to a significant level (P < 0.01) for up to 1 year at -20°C compared with samples stored without antioxidants. This study confirms the deleterious effect of lipid oxidation products on protein structure and function in frozen fatty fish. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Antioxidants; Fatty fish lipids; Frozen storage; Lipid oxidation; Proteins","Scomber; Scomber scombrus; food science","","","","","","","Saeed S., Fawthrop S.A., Howell N.K., Electron spin resonance (ESR) study on free-radical transfer in fish lipid-protein interactions, J Sci Food Agric, 79, pp. 1809-1816, (1999); Saeed S., Howell N.K., High-performance liquid chromatography and spectroscopic studies on fish oil oxidation products extracted from frozen Atlantic mackerel, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 76, pp. 391-397, (1999); Howell N.K., Gelation properties and interactions of fish proteins, Food Hydrocolloids I: Physical Chemistry and Industrial Application of Gels, Polysaccharides and Proteins, pp. 399-406, (1999); Howell N.K., Protein-protein interactions, Biochemistry of Food Proteins, pp. 35-74, (1992); Howell N.K., Herman H., Li-Chan E.C.Y., Elucidation of protein-lipid interactions in a lysozyme-corn oil system by Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 1529-1533, (2001); Dyer W.J., Dingle J.R., Fish proteins with special reference to freezing, Fish as Food, pp. 275-327, (1961); Sikorski Z., Olley J., Kostuch S., Protein changes in frozen fish, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 8, pp. 97-129, (1976); Matsumoto J.J., Denaturation of fish muscle proteins during frozen storage, Proteins at low temperatures, 180, pp. 205-224, (1979); Shenouda S.Y.K., Theories of protein denaturation during frozen storage of fish flesh, Adv Food Res, 26, pp. 273-311, (1980); Sikorski Z.E., Kolakowska A., Pan B.S., The nutritive composition of the major groups of marine food organisms, Seafood, Resources, Nutritional Composition, and Preservation, pp. 9-54, (1990); Sikorski Z.E., Kolakowska A., Changes in proteins in frozen stored fish, Seafood Proteins, pp. 99-112, (1994); Haard N.F., Biochemical reactions in fish muscle during frozen storage, Seafood Science and Technology, pp. 13-39, (1992); Konig A.J., Mol T.H., Quantitative quality tests for frozen fish: Soluble protein and free fatty acid content as quality criteria for hake (Merluccius capensis) stored at -18°C, J Sci Food Agric, 54, pp. 449-458, (1991); Kolakowska A., Kwiatkowska L., Lachowicz K., Gajowiecki L., Bortnowska G., Effect of fishing season on frozen storage quality of Baltic herring, Seafood Science and Technology, pp. 269-277, (1992); Roubal W.T., Trapped radicals in dry lipid-protein systems undergoing oxidation, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 47, pp. 141-144, (1970); Braddock R.J., Dugan L.R., Reaction of autoxidizing linoleate with Coho salmon myosin, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 50, pp. 343-346, (1973); Jahrenback L., Liljemark A., Ultrastructural changes during frozen storage of cod. 1.

However, at that time, the product was not commercialized owing to the high energetic cost of the isolation methods used. Currently, improvements in nanocellulose production allow its commercialization. The high surface area and aspect ratio, rheological behavior, water absorption and absence of cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of nanocellulose facilitate its use in food applications. In this review, three different applications were identified: (i) nanocellulose as a stabilizing agent, (ii) nanocellulose as a functional food ingredient and (iii) nanocellulose in food packaging. The last is the most common application of nanocellulose in the food industry. Aiming to demonstrate the potential of nanocellulose as a stabilizing and functional food ingredient, relevant publications on uses of nanocellulose in food are examined, focusing on applications of nanocellulose as a food additive and safety and regulatory issues. Nanocellulose has potential use as a stabilizing agent in food emulsions, as dietary fiber and to reduce the caloric value of food. Nevertheless, validated standards to characterize the produced nanostructure, quantify its properties and evaluate its toxicity are still required to answer safety and regulatory issues to achieve the incorporation of nanocellulose as a commercial product in the food industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Food additive; Nanotechnology regulation; Vegetable nanocellulose","Accident prevention; Food additives; Functional food; Nanocellulose; Vegetables; Water absorption; Food industries; Food ingredients; Food science; Nano-cellulose; Nanotechnology regulation; Property; Regulatory issues; Safety issues; Stabilizing agents; Vegetable nanocellulose; Aspect ratio","","","","","Administrative Department of for Science, technology and Innovation of the Colombian Government; Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS); Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, UPB, (363B-02/15-49)","The authors acknowledge the Administrative Department of for Science, technology and Innovation of the Colombian Government (COLCIENCIAS) and the Research Center for Investigation and Development (CIDI) from the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana for their financial support through the program Es tiempo de volver (Grant 363B-02/15-49 ).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), another type of NMR technology, has extensively been used in medical radiology to obtain soft tissue images for diagnostic purposes in medicine. Food scientists have also explored the use of both NMR and MRI and continue to develop a wide range of applications for food analysis and food processing. This review begins with a brief introduction to NMR and then focuses on current diverse NMR applications in food research and manufacturing. Topics covered include chemical compositional analysis and structural identification of functional components in foods, determination of composition and formulation of packaging materials, detection of food authentication, optimization of food processing parameters, and inspection of microbiological, physical and chemical quality of foods. This review also emphasizes the pros and cons of specific NMR applications in the analysis of representative foods such as wine, cheese, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, beverages (i.e. tomato juice and pulp, green tea, coffee) and edible oils, as well as discussing both the challenges and future opportunities in NMR applications in food science. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Foods;

This examination is in the light of recent research on meat biochemistry, and from this, areas of research that may prove fruitful are highlighted. Based on available data, the major candidate to explain tenderisation post-rigor is the calpain protease system. Evidence that change in the binding of actomyosin (the complex of contractile proteins formed at rigor) or cleavage of myofibrillar proteins due to Ca2+ ions contributes to tenderisation is far from compelling. Equally it appears that the cathepsin proteases are unlikely to have a role in early post-mortem cleavage of proteins (proteolysis) and thus tenderisation. The mode of action of the calpains is not yet fully defined and questions remain as to the role of m-calpain given the in vitro requirement for a Ca2+ ion concentration exceeding that observed in post-mortem muscle. The existence of the calpains in living muscle and other tissues suggests a mode of action more subtle than currently thought. Additionally, the observation that the degradation of myofibrillar proteins occurs in the presence of effective synthetic and natural calpain inhibitors suggests that other enzymes may also have a role in tenderisation. Inevitably, the accumulated evidence points to a complex system likely to involve interacting proteases and ions, and only through open minded investigation with reliance on developments in the medical and biochemical fields will a more complete model of tenderisation be developed.","Actomyosin; Calpains; Cathepsins; Ions; Proteases","Ovis aries; food science","","","","","","","Aalhus J.L., Calcium chloride mediated tenderisation - Is calpain activation the mechanism?, Meat Focus International, 3, pp. 21-24, (1994); Aalhus J.L., Dugan M.E.R., Best D.R., Calcium chloride - Accelerates tenderisation or prevents toughening?, Meat Focus International, 5, pp. 441-443, (1996); Alareon-Rojo A.D., Dransfield E., Alteration of post-mortem ageing in beef by the addition of enzyme inhibitors and activators, Meat Science, 41, pp. 163-178, (1995); Averna M., De Tullio R., Passalacquia M., Salamino F., Pontremoli S., Melloni E., Changes in intracellular calpastatin localization are mediated by reversible phosphorylation, Biochemical Journal, 354, pp. 25-30, (2001); Bandman E., Zdanis D., An immunological method to assess protein degradation in post-mortem muscle, Meat Science, 22, pp. 1-19, (1988); Barrett A.J., Kembhavi A.A., Brown M.A., Kirschke H., Knight C.G., Tamai M., Hanada K., L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido (4-guanidino) butane (E-64) and its analogues as inhibitors of cysteine proteinases including cathepsins B, H and L, Biochemical Journal, 201, pp. 189-198, (1982); Beltran J.A., Jaime I., Santolaria P., Sanudo C., Alberti P., Roncales P., Effect of stress-induced high post-mortem pH on protease activity and tenderness of beef, Meat Science, 45, pp. 201-207, (1997); Birkedal-Hansen H., Moore W.G.I., Bodden M.K., Windsor L.J., Birkedal-Hansen B., DeCarlo A., Engler J.A., Matrix metalloproteinases: A review, Critical Reviews in Oral Biology and Medicine, 4, pp. 197-250, (1993); Bode W., Strobl S., Fernandez-Catalan C., Braun M., Huber R., Reverter D., Masumoto H., Nakagawa K., Irie A., Sorimachi H., Bourenkow G., Bartunik H., Suzuki K., The crystal structure of calcium-free human m-calpain suggests an electrostatic switch mechanism for activation by Calcium, Proceedings of an International Conference on cysteine proteinases and their inhibitors: the new millennium, (2000); Boehm M.L., Kendall T.L., Thompson V.F., Goll D.E., Changes in the calpains and calpastatin during postmortem storage of bovine muscle, Journal of Animal Science, 76, pp. 2415-2434, (1998); Branca D., Gugliucci A., Bano D., Brini M., Carafoli E., Expression, partial purification and functional properties of the muscle specific calpain isoform p94, European Journal of Biochemistry, 265, pp. 835-846, (1999); Busch W.A., Goll D.E., Parrish Jr. F.C., Molecular properties of postmortem muscle.

Various high-pressure treatments (50-350 MPa) combined with different temperatures (30 and 60°C) and times (2.5, 5 and 15 min) of treatment were assayed. The carotenoid content of the orange juice was analysed by HPLC-UV, the vitamin A value was determined as retinol equivalents (RE) and the free radical-scavenging capacity was evaluated using the DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1, 1-picrylhydrazyl) radical model system. A storage study was carried out at refrigeration temperature (4°C). High-pressure treatments at 350MPa produced significant increases of 20-43% in the carotenoid content of fresh orange juice (from 3.99 to 4.78-5.70 mg l-1). A non-uniform behaviour of high-pressure treatments was detected. An increase in time (beyond 5 min) or temperature (above 30°C) of treatment did not improve the amount of carotenoids extracted. Owing to better extraction of carotenoids, an increase in vitamin A value from 164 to 238RE1-1 (45%) was achieved with the 350MPa/30°C/5min treatment. No correlation was found between the increase in carotenoid amount extracted and the free radical-scavenging activity. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carotenoids; High pressure; Orange juice; Radical-scavenging capacity; Vitamin A","food science; nutritive value; vitamin","","","","","","","Giovannucci E., Ascherio A., Rimm E.B., Stampfer M.J., Colditz G.A., Willet W.C., Intake of carotenoid and retinol in relation to prostate cancer risk, J Natl Cancer Inst, 87, pp. 1767-1776, (1995); Steinmetz K.A., Potter J.D., Vegetables, fruit, and cancer prevention: A review, J Am Diet Assoc, 53, pp. 536-543, (1996); Tibble D.L., Further evidence of the cardiovascular benefits of diet enriched in carotenoids, Am J Clin Nutr, 68, pp. 521-522, (1999); Slaterry M.L., Benson J., Curtin K., Khe-Ni-Ma, Schaeffer D., Potter J.D., Cartenoids and colon cancer, Am J Clin Nutr, 71, pp. 575-582, (2000); Boileau T.W.M., Moore A.C., Erdman J.W., Carotenoids and vitamin A, Antioxidant Status, Diet, Nutrition and Health, (1999); Rapisarda P., Tomaino A., Lo Cascio R., Bonina F., De Pasquale A., Saija A., Antioxidant effectiveness as influenced by phenolic content of fresh orange juices, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 4718-4723, (1999); Gardner P.T., White T.A.C., McPhail D.B., Duthie G.G., The relative contributions of vitamin C, carotenoids and phenolics to the antioxidant potential of fruit juices, Food Chem, 68, pp. 471-474, (2000); Chen C.S., Shaw P.E., Paris M.E., Orange and tangerine juices, Fruit Juice Processing Technology, pp. 110-165, (1993); Cheftel J., Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on food constituents: An overview, High Pressure and Biotechnology, pp. 195-209, (1992); Knorr D., High pressure effects on plant derived products, High Pressure Processing of Food, pp. 123-135, (1995); Cano M.P., Hernandez A., De Ancos B., High pressure and temperature effects on enzyme inactivation in strawberry and orange products, J Food Sci, 62, pp. 85-88, (1997); Hendrickx M., Ludikhuyze L., Van den Broeck I., Weemaes C., Effects of high pressure on enzymes related to food quality, Trends Food Sci Technol, 9, pp. 197-203, (1998); Hernandez A., Cano M.P., High pressure and temperature effects on enzyme inactivation in tomato puree, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 266-270, (1998); Smelt J.P.P.M., Recent advances in the microbiology of high pressure processing, Trends Food Sci Technol, 9, pp. 152-158, (1998); Van den Broeck I., Ludikhuyze L., Weemaes C., Van Loey A., Hendrickx M., Kinetics for isobaric-isothermal degradation of L-ascorbic acid, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 2001-2006, (1998); Van Loey V., Olms V., Weemaes C., Van den Broeck I., Ludikhuyze L., Indrawati, Denys S., Hendrickx M., Thermal and pressure-temperature degradation of chlorophyll in broccoli (Brassica oleracea L italica) juice: A kinetic study, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 5289-5294, (1998); Quaglia G.B., Gravina R., Paperi R., Paoletti F., Effect of high pressure treatments on peroxidase activity, ascorbic acid content and texture in green peas, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 29, pp. 552-555, (1996); Donsi G., Ferrari G., Di Matteo M., High pressure stabilization of orange juice, evaluation of the effects of process conditions, Ital J Food Sci, 2, pp. 99-107, (1996); De Ancos B., Gonzalez E., Cano M.P., Effect of high pressure treatment on the carotenoid composition and the radical scavenging activity of persimmon fruit purees, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 3542-3548, (2000); Gartner C., Stahl W., Sies H., Lycopene is more bioavailable from tomato paste than from fresh tomotoes, Am J Clin Nutr, 66, pp. 116-122, (1997); Cano M.P., De Ancos B., Carotenoid and carotenoid ester composition in mango fruit as influenced by processing method, J Agric Food Chem, 42, pp. 2726-2742, (1994); Cano M.P., De Ancos B., Lobo M.G., Monreal M., Carotenoid pigments and colour of hermaphrodite and female papaya fruits (Carica papaya L) cv.

Hydrogels have attracted great attention due to their diverse functional properties, and their wide range of applications, such as in soft robots and actuators, stretched electronic devices, tissue engineering materials, controlled-release drug delivery vehicles, biomedicine materials, food science, and (bio)sensors. In general, there are four core concerns in hydrogel science, including the polymer source, structure fabrication, gel function, and gel applications. According to the logic that the “structure determines function”, it is believed that rational design of structures can effectively regulate the functions and applications of hydrogels. Hence, in the current review, “structure” as the core topic will be highly regarded, and the crosslinking mechanisms and structural diversity of hydrogels are comprehensively summarized. Additionally, hydrogels also show their great application potential in food science. Hence, the current review also pays more attention to the application of hydrogels in food nutrition and health, food engineering and processing, and food safety. It is whished that this review not only serves as a reference for improving the comprehensive understanding of the structural design of hydrogels but also provides a forward-looking idea for hydrogel applications in food science. © 2021 The Author(s).

The packaged foods were stored at 3 and 10°C and changes in counts of total aerobic bacteria and coliform bacteria were monitored together with appropriate quality attributes in order to determine the influence of the bacteriocin-coated films on quality preservation and shelf-life extension. Compared to plain low-density polyethylene film, plastic films with incorporated bacteriocins slowed down microbial growth on packaged oysters and ground beef at both temperatures, contributed in some degree to the preservation of chemical quality and extended shelf-life significantly. The effects of the antimicrobial films on the suppression of coliform bacterial growth were more pronounced at 10 than at 3°C, while the effects on total aerobic bacteria were consistently evident at both temperatures. There was no difference in food quality preservation between the two types of antimicrobial film. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Antimicrobial film; Lacticin; Microbial spoilage; Nisin; Preservation","Bacteria (microorganisms); Ostreidae; food safety; food science","","","","","","","Hotchkiss J.H., Safety considerations in active packaging, Active Food Packaging, pp. 238-255, (1995); Han J.H., Antimicrobial food packaging, Food Technol, 54, 3, pp. 56-65, (2000); Siragusa G.R., Cutter C.N., Willett J.L., Incorporation of bacteriocin in plastic retains activity and inhibits surface growth of bacteria on meat, Food Microbiol, 16, pp. 229-235, (1999); Cutter C.N., Siragusa G.R., Growth of Brochothrix thermosphacta in ground beef following treatments with nisin in a calcium alginate cell, Food Microbiol, 14, pp. 425-430, (1997); Bower C.K., McGuire J., Daechel M.A., Influences on the antimicrobial activity of surface-adsorbed nisin, J Ind Microbiol, 15, pp. 227-233, (1995); Bower C.K., McGuire J., Daeschel M.A., Suppression of Listeria monocytogenes colonization following adsorption of nisin onto silica surfaces, Appl Environ Microbiol, 61, pp. 992-997, (1995); Daeschel M.A., McGuir J., Al-Makhlafi H., Antimicrobial activity of nisin adsorbed to hydrophilic and hydrophobic silicon surfaces, J Food Protect, 55, pp. 731-735, (1992); Ming X., Weber G.H., Ayres J.W., Sandine W.E., Bacteriocins applied to food packaging materials to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes on meats, J Food Sci, 62, pp. 413-415, (1997); An D.S., Kim Y.M., Lee S.B., Paik H.D., Lee D.S., Antimicrobial low density polyethylene film coated with bacteriocins in binder medium, Food Sci Biotechnol, 9, pp. 14-20, (2000); Kim Y.M., Lee N.K., Paik H.D., Lee D.S., Migration of bacteriocin from bacteriocin-coated film and its antimicrobial activity, Food Sci Biotechnol, 9, pp. 325-329, (2000); Ray B., Nisin of Lactococcus lactis ssp Lactis as a food biopreservative, Food Biopreservatives of Microbial Origin, pp. 207-264, (1992); Johnston R.W., Tompkin R.B., Meat and poultry products, Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Estimation of Foods, 3rd edn, pp. 821-835, (1992); Conway E.J., Byrne A., An absorption apparatus for the microdetermination of certain volatile substances.

Lambs were raised on pasture (ram or castrate) or on a maize-based or lucerne-based concentrate diet (ram only). They were slaughtered at 132 and 232 days. Fat from animals raised on concentrates had lower proportions of fat-hardening stearic acid and higher proportions of oxidation-prone fat-softening oleic and linoleic acids. Concentrations of species-characterising short branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), typified by 4-methyloctanoic acid, were lower for pasture-fed lambs, particularly at 232 days, although between-animal variation was high. Castration did not statistically affect BCFA concentration at this age. Correlations between BCFAs and testes weight were not significant, suggesting that they were not acting as sex pheromones. Concentrations of 3-methylindole (skatole) in perirenal fat were higher for the pasture diet at both slaughter dates. Concentrations of 4-methylphenol in the fat were not affected by diet. However, 3-methylphenol was more abundant in pasture treatments. A sensory panel found that the intensity of 'sheepmeat' flavour was higher for pasture-raised animals, but that associations of 'barnyard' flavour (which has been linked to pastoral flavour) with diet were more complex. The issue was resolved by fat sniffing. Panel responses to heated subcutaneous fat were recorded as frequency of descriptive terms drawn from a limited lexicon. Volatiles from fats pooled by treatment were resolved on a gas chromatographic column whose effluent was monitored by odourport sniffing. Compounds were identified by parallel chromatographic/mass spectrometric runs. The headspace concentrations of these compounds were then measured for individual animals. These data were related to frequency data by the principal component method. 'Mutton' and 'sheepmeat' odour notes were clearly linked to indoles (skatole particularly) and, to a lesser extent, methylphenol, setting these notes apart from 'lamb', an odour note more associated with lucerne and maize diets through higher concentrations of BCFAs. It was concluded that 3-methylindole was the major cause of pastoral flavour in sheepmeat, and that fat oxidation products represented a background flavour that varied quantitatively but not qualitatively with fatty acid profile. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Diet; Fatty acids; Pastoral flavour; Phenols; Sheep; Skatole","Animalia; lamb; Medicago sativa; Ovis aries; Zea mays; food science","","","","","","","Berry B.W., Maga J.A., Calkins C.R., Wells L.H., Carpenter Z.L., Cross H.R., Flavor profile analysis of cooked beef loin steaks, J Food Sci, 45, pp. 1113-1121, (1980); Larick D.K., Hendrick H.B., Bailey M.E., Williams J.E., Hancock D.L., Garner G.B., Morrow R.E., Flavor constituents of beef as infuenced by forage and grain feeding, J Food Sci, 52, pp. 245-251, (1987); Keen A.R., Wilson R.D., Pasture feeding - A contribution of additional flavour nuances to milkfat and meat flavour, New Zealand Dairy Research Institute Milkfat Flavour Forum: Summary of Proceedings, pp. 24-31, (1993); Wong E., Johnson C.B., Nixon L.N., The contribution of 4-methyloctanoic (hircinoic) acid to mutton and goat meat flavour, NZ J Agric Res, 18, pp. 261-266, (1975); Duncan W.R.H., Garton G.A., Differences in the proportions of branched-chain fatty acids in subcutaneous triacylglycerols of barley-fed ruminants, Br J Nutr, 40, pp. 29-33, (1978); Brennand C.P., Lindsay R.C., Distribution of volatile branched-chain fatty acids in various lamb tissues, Meat Sci, 31, pp. 411-421, (1992); Scaife J.R., Garton G.A., Methylmalonate as a precursor in vitro of branched-chain fatty acids, Biochem Soc Trans, 3, pp. 1011-1012, (1975); Prescott J., Young O., O'Neill L., The impact of variations in flavour compounds on meat acceptability: A comparison of Japanese and New Zealand consumers, Food Qual Prefer, 12, pp. 257-264, (2001); Melton S.L., Black J.M., Davis G.W., Backus W.R., Flavor and selected chemical components of ground beef from steers backgrounded on pasture and fed corn up to 140 days, J Food Sci, 47, pp. 699-704, (1982); Melton S.L., Amiri M., Davis G.W., Backus W.R., Flavor and chemical characteristics of ground beef from grass, forage-grain and grain-finished steers, J Anim Sci, 55, pp. 77-87, (1982); Westerling D.A., Hendrick H.B., Fatty acid composition of bovine lipids as influenced by diet, sex and anatomical location and relationship to sensory characteristics, J Anim.

The interaction of these proteins with the procyanidin compounds was assayed using nephelometry, and the influence of several factors was investigated, such as degree of polymerisation, pH and concentrations of both protein and tannin. The same experiments were performed with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The amount of insoluble aggregates, resulting from the formation of polyphenol-protein aggregates, increased quickly up to a maximum value which thereafter remained practically unchanged. pH was set at 5.0 for all further assays, since it was the nearest value to that encountered in human saliva (pH 5.6-7.9), where proteins were stable and had a maximum ability to bind and precipitate procyanidin oligomers. These proteins were shown to have a strong affinity for procyanidin oligomers and were unable to resolubilise the polyphenol-protein aggregates when present in excess. PRPs required a much lower content to bind all the tannins (400 μg of procyanidin oligomers) than BSA and especially α-amylase (48, 60 and 132 μg respectively). The procyanidin's ability to bind PRPs, BSA and α-amylase increased with its average molecular weight. This ability increased regularly for PRPs up to 4500Da, whereas the ability to bind the globular proteins decreased beyond 3400Da. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Astringency; BSA; Grape seeds; Nephelometry; Procyanidin; Salivary proteins","Bovinae; Vitis sp.; food science","","","","","","","Bate-Smith E.C., Haemanalysis of tannins: The concept of relative astringency, Phytochemistry, 12, pp. 907-912, (1973); Goldstein J.L., Swain T., Changes in tannins ripening fruits, Phytochemistry, 2, pp. 371-383, (1963); Luck G., Liao H., Murray N.J., Grimmer H.R., Warminski E.E., Willianson M.P., Lilley T.H., Haslam E., Polyphenols, astringency and proline-rich proteins, Phytochemistry, 37, pp. 357-371, (1994); Bate-Smith E.C., Astringency in foods, Food, 23, pp. 124-127, (1954); Oh H.I., Hoff J.E., Armstrong G.S., Haff L.A., Hydrophobic interaction in tannin-protein complexes, J Agric Food Chem, 28, pp. 394-398, (1980); Asano K., Shinagawa K., Hashimoto N., Characterization of haze-forming proteins of beer and their roles in chill faze formation, Am Soc Brew Chem, 40, pp. 147-154, (1982); Haslam E., Natural polyphenols (vegetable tannins) as drugs: Possible modes of action, J Nat Prod, 5, pp. 205-215, (1996); Sarni-Manchado P., Cheynier V., Moutounet M., Interactions of grape seed tannins with salivary proteins, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 42-47, (1999); Hagerman A.E., Butler L.G., The specificity of proanthocyanidin-protein interactions, J Biol Chem, 256, pp. 4494-4497, (1981); Asquith T.N., Uhlig J., Mehansho H., Putman L., Carlson D.M., Butler L., Binding of condensed tannins to salivary proline-rich glycoproteins: The role of carbohydrate, J Agric Food Chem, 35, pp. 331-334, (1987); Austin P.J., Suchar L.A., Robbins C.T., Hagerman A.E., Tanninbinding proteins in saliva of deer and their absence in saliva of sheep and cattle, J Chem Ecol, 15, pp. 1335-1347, (1989); Baxter N.J., Lilley T.H., Haslam E., Williamson M.P., Multiple interactions between polyphenols and a salivary proline-rich protein.

In a first period of 3 months, three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets containing 9% of added marine fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO) or linseed oil (LO) were fed to triplicate groups of 25 marketable size turbot (initial body weight: 579 ± 1 g) grown in sea water at the temperature of 17°C. At the end of the first period, all groups of turbot were fed with the diet containing fish oil (diet FO) for a further period of 2 months. The gutted and fillet yields were not affected by the incorporation of vegetable oils. However, soybean or linseed oils significantly affected the organoleptic quality of flesh particularly odour, colour and texture. A more pronounced potatoes odour and a lower fat texture were observed in dorsal fillet of turbot fed soybean oil diet. During the washout period, the differences observed between treatments in first period on sensory attributes disappeared. This study showed that the changes in organoleptic properties occurring due to the intake of vegetable oils can be reduced with a return to a fish-oil-based diet. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Plant polyphenols are known for their role in food quality and safety, since they contribute significantly to taste, flavour, colour, stability etc., while they are increasingly recognised as important factors in long-term health, contributing towards reducing the risk of chronic disease. Almost 200 years ago, hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) were the first group of plant polyphenols subjected to analytical chemical research. Despite the lack of commercially available standards, food analysis research offers a wealth of papers dealing with extraction optimisation, identification and quantification of HTs. The object of this review is to summarise analytical chemistry applications and the tools currently used for the analysis of HTs in food. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These include the green pigment chlorophyll, the yellow pigment β-carotene, the red pigment lycopene and the colourless glycoalkaloid α-tomatine. The levels of these compounds are strongly influenced by the maturity of the tomatoes. Widely consumed Japanese tomato varieties Momotaro, Momotaro-T93 and First Memory at five different stages of ripeness, each harvested at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 days after flowering of the plants, were analysed for the contents of these compounds. Additionally, tomato clusters from different locations along the vine on the same plant were also evaluated. The results show that chlorophyll and tomatine concentrations decrease rapidly during the growth of the tomatoes. By contrast, β-carotene and lycopene levels are low in immature and high in mature tomatoes. The location of the tomato clusters and tomato variety did not significantly affect these results. The possible usefulness of these results to optimise health-promoting effects of tomatoes is discussed. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","α-tomatine; β-carotene; Chlorophyll; Green tomatoes; Human health; Lycopene; Red tomatoes","Lycopersicon esculentum; food science","","","","","","","Friedman M., Kozukue N., Harden L.A., Structure of the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatidienol-3-β-lycotetraose (dehydrotomatine), J Agric Food Chem, 45, pp. 1541-1547, (1997); Friedman M., Levin C.E., Dehydrotomatine content in tomatoes, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 4571-4576, (1998); Madhavi D.L., Salunkhe D.K., Tomato, Handbook of Vegetable Science, pp. 171-201, (1998); Martin-Hernandez A.M., Dufresne M., Hugouvieux V., Melton R., Osbourn A., Effects of targeted replacement of the tomatinase gene on the interaction of Septoria lycopersici with tomato plants, Mol Plant-Microbe Interact, 13, pp. 1301-1311, (2000); Moehs C.P., Tian L., Osteryoung K.W., Dellapenna D., Analysis of carotenoid biosynthetic gene expression during marigold petal development, Plant Mol Biol, 45, pp. 281-293, (2001); Roddick J.G., Steroidal glycoalkaloids: Nature and consequences of bioactivity, Adv Exp Med Biol, 404, pp. 277-295, (1996); Beecher G.R., Nutrient content of tomatoes and tomato products, Proc Soc Exp Biol Med, 218, pp. 98-100, (1998); Agarwal S., Rao A.V., Tomato lycopene and low density lipoprotein oxidation: A human dietary intervention study, Lipids, 33, pp. 981-984, (1998); Barrette E.O., Can dietary choices prevent prostate cancer?, Altern Med, 4, pp. 1-5, (2001); Friedman M., Fitch T.E., Levin C.E., Yokoyama W.H., Feeding tomatoes to hamsters reduces their plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, J Food Sci, 65, pp. 897-900, (2000); Paiva S.A., Russell R.M., Beta-carotene and other carotenoids as antioxidants, J Am Coll Nutr, 18, pp. 426-433, (1999); Friedman M., Fitch T.E., Yokoyama W.H., Lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol in hamsters by the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatine, Food Chem Toxicol, 38, pp. 549-553, (2000); Friedman M., McDonald G.M., Potato glycoalkaloids: Chemistry, analysis, safety, and plant physiology, Crit Rev Plant Sci, 16, pp. 55-132, (1997); Friedman M., Levin C.E., α-tomatine content in tomato and tomato products determined by HPLC with pulsed amperometric detection, J Agric Food Chem, 43, pp. 1507-1511, (1995); Heftmann E., Schwimmer S., Degradation of tomatine to 3β-hydroxy-5α-pregn-16-en-20-one by ripe tomatoes, Phytochemistry, 11, pp. 2783-2787, (1972); Abushita A.A., Daood H.G., Biacs P.A., Change in carotenoids and antioxidant vitamins in tomato as a function of varietal and technological factors, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 2075-2081, (2000); Leonardi C., Ambrosino P., Esposito F., Fogliano V., Anti-oxidative activity and carotenoid and tomatine contents in different typologies of fresh consumption tomatoes, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 4723-4727, (2000); Sinden S.L., Schalk J.M., Stoner A.K., Effects of daylength and maturity of tomato plants on tomatine content and resistance to the Colorado potato beetle, J Am Soc Hort Sci, 103, pp. 596-600, (1978); Methods of Analysis, pp. 55-56, (1965); Kozukue N., Kozukue E., Yamashita H., Fujii S., α-tomatine purification and quantification in tomatoes by HPLC, J Food Sci, 59, pp. 1211-1212, (1994); Friedman M., Kozukue N., Harden L.A., Preparation and characterization of acid hydrolysis products of the tomato glycoalkaloid α-tomatine., J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 2096-2101, (1998); Minguez Mosquera M.I., Hornero Mendez D., Separation and quantification of the carotenoid pigments in red peppers (Capsicum annuum L), paprika, and oleoresin by reversed-phase HPLC, J Agric Food Chem, 41, pp. 1616-1620, (1993); Schmitz H.H., Artz W.E., Poor C.L., Dietz J.M., Erdman J.W.

Organogels were produced at different temperatures and qualitative phase diagrams were constructed to identify and classify the type of structure formed at various compositions. The microstructure of gelator crystals was studied by polarized light microscopy. Melting and crystallization were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and rheology (flow and small amplitude oscillatory measurements) to understand organogels' behaviour under different mechanical and thermal conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was employed for a further understanding of oil-gelator chemical interactions. Results showed that the increase of beeswax concentration led to higher values of storage and loss moduli (G', G″) and complex modulus (G*) of organogels, which is associated to the strong network formed between the crystalline gelator structure and the oil phase. Crystallization occurred in two steps (well evidenced for higher concentrations of gelator) during temperature decreasing. Thermal analysis showed the occurrence of hysteresis between melting and crystallization. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis allowed a better understanding in terms of how crystal conformations were disposed for each type of organogel. The structuring process supported by medium or long-chain triglycerides oils was an important exploit to apprehend the impact of different carbon chain-size on the gelation process and on gels' properties. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Crystallinity; Food science; Oleogel; Rheology; Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS); Wax","Carbon; Chains; Chemical analysis; Complex networks; Crystal microstructure; Differential scanning calorimetry; Elasticity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gelation; Melting; Oils and fats; Rheology; Thermoanalysis; Vegetable oils; Waxes; Chemical interactions; Crystallinities; Food science; Medium chain triglycerides; Melting and crystallization; Oleogel; Oscillatory measurements; Storage and loss modulus; X ray scattering","","","","","Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester, FSE; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/BIO/04469/2013); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (348/13); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (Universal 479459/2012-6); Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC, (FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-027462, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006684, RECI/BBB-EBI/0179/2012)","The authors thank the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, SP, Brazil) for the opportunity to carry out SAXS measurements.

It took over 75 y to realize that zinc is also an essential trace element for rats, and an additional 30 y went by before it was recognized that this was also true for humans. The adult body contains about 2 to 3 g of zinc. Zinc is found in organs, tissues, bones, fluids, and cells. It is essential for many physiological functions and plays a significant role in a number of enzyme actions in the living systems. Bioinformatics estimates report that 10% of the human proteome contains zinc-binding sites. Based on its role in such a plethora of cellular components, zinc has diverse biological functions from enzymatic catalysis to playing a crucial role in cellular neuronal systems. Thus, based on the various published studies and reports, it is pertinent to state that zinc is one of the most important essential trace metals in human nutrition and lifestyle. Its deficiency may severely affect the homeostasis of a biological system. This review compiles the role of zinc in prophylaxis/therapeutics and provides current information about its effect on living beings. © 2014 Institute of Food Technologists.","Antimicrobial; Enzyme; Food science; Nutrition; Zinc","Aspergillus; Bioinformatics; Biological systems; Enzymes; Nutrition; Physiology; Antimicrobial; Aspergillus niger; Biological functions; Cellular components; Enzymatic catalysis; Food science; Physiological functions; Zinc-binding sites; Zinc","","","","","","","Ackland M.L., Michalczyk A., Zinc deficiency and its inherited disorders-a review, Genes Nutr, 1, pp. 41-49, (2006); Adachi Y., Yoshida J., Kodera Y., Kiss T., Jakusch T., Enyedy E.A., Yoshikawa Y., Sakurai H., Oral administration of a zinc complex improves type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndromes, Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 351, pp. 165-170, (2006); Aiken S., Horn N.M., Saunders N.R., Effects of histidine on tissue zinc distribution in rats, Biometals, 5, pp. 235-243, (1992); Ali P., Hanachi P., Golkhoo S., Effect of zinc supplement on the upper and lower trunk strength on athletics women, Res J Intern Stud, 9, pp. 59-63, (2009); Amani R., Saeidi S., Nazari Z., Nematpour S., Correlation between dietary zinc intakes and its serum levels with depression scales in young female students, Biol Trace Elem Res, 137, pp. 150-158, (2010); Anderson R.A., Roussel A.M., Zouari N., Mahjoub S., Matheau J.M., Kerkeni A., Potential antioxidant effects of zinc and chromium supplementation in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, J Am Coll Nutr, 20, pp. 212-218, (2001); Andreini C., Bertini I., A bioinformatics view of zinc enzymes, J Inorg Biochem, 111, pp. 150-156, (2012); Andrews M., Gallagher-Allred C., The role of zinc in wound healing, Adv Wound Care, 12, pp. 137-138, (1999); Archana J., Navaneethan M., Ponnusamy S., Hayakawa Y., Muthamizhchelvan C., Organic molecules passivated manganese doped zinc selenide quantum dots and its properties, Appl Surf Sci, 257, pp. 7699-7703, (2011); Arslantas A., Devrim A.K., Kaya N., Necefoglu H., Studies on the interaction between zinc-hydroxybenzoite complex and genomic DNA, Intl J Mol Sci, 7, pp. 111-118, (2006); Arvanitidou V., Voskaki I., Tripsianis G., Athanasopoulou H., Tsalkidis A., Filippidis S., Schulpis K., Androulakis I., Serum copper and zinc concentrations in healthy children aged 3-14 years in Greece, Biol Trace Elem Res, 115, pp. 1-12, (2007); (2005); Augustyniak M., Babczynska A., Augustyniak M., Oxidative stress in newly hatched chorthippus brunneus-the effects of zinc treatment during diapause depending on the female's age and its origins, Comp Biochem Physiol C Sep, 154, 3, pp. 172-179, (2011); Azizzadeh M., Mohri M., Seifi H.A., Effect of oral zinc supplementation on hematology, serum biochemistry, performance, and health in neonatal dairy calves, Comp Clin Path, 14, pp. 67-71, (2005); Bakan R., Birmingham C.L., Aeberhardt L., Goldner E.M., Dietary zinc intake of vegetarian and nonvegetarian patients with anorexia nervosa, Intl J Eat Disord, 13, pp. 229-233, (1993); Baqui A.H., Black R.E., Fischer Walker C.L., Arifeen S., Zaman K., Yunus M., Wahed M.A., Caulfield L.E., Zinc supplementation and serum zinc during diarrhea, Indian J Pediatr, 73, pp. 493-497, (2006); Baum M.K., Shor-Posner G., Campa A., Zinc status in human immunodeficiency virus infection, J Nutr, 130, 5, (2000); Bedwal R.S., Bahuguna A., Zinc, copper and selenium in reproduction, Experientia, 50, pp. 626-640, (1994); Beskonakli E., Palaoglu S., Aksaray S., Alanoglu G., Turhan T., Taskin Y., Effect of pinealectomy on immune parameters in rats with Staphylococcus aureus infection, Neurosurg Rev, 24, pp. 26-30, (2001); Beutler K., Pankewycz O., Brautigan D.L., Equivalent uptake of organic and inorganic zinc by monkey kidney fibroblasts, human intestinal epithelial cells, or perfused mouse intestine, Biol Trace Elem Res, 61, pp. 19-31, (1998); Bhatnagar S., Natchu U.C., Zinc in child health and disease, Indian J Pediatr, 71, pp. 991-995, (2004); Bjorklund N.L., Sadagoparamanujam V.M., Taglialatela G., Selective, quantitative measurement of releasable synaptic zinc in human autopsy hippocampal brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients, J Neurosci Meth, 203, pp. 146-151, (2012); Bocchini S.F., Habr-Gama A., Kiss D.R., Imperiale A.R., Araujo S.E.A., Gluteal and perianal hidradenitis suppurativa.

Their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the intestines of insects and birds. The source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is unknown. In the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 646 Enterococcus strains which were isolated from a Cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. Nine different PFGE patterns, three of Enterococcus casseliflavus, five of Enterococcus faecalis, and one of Enterococcus durans, were found. The same three clones, one of E. faecalis and two of E. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. The two E. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. It is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. Cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk or the cheese.","","Animals; Cattle; Cheese; Culture Media; Ecosystem; Enterococcus; Milk; Streptococcus bovis; Animalia; Aves; Bacteria (microorganisms); Enterococcus; Enterococcus casseliflavus; Enterococcus durans; Enterococcus faecalis; Enterococcus faecium; Hexapoda; Negibacteria; Streptococcus; Streptococcus bovis; Dairy products; Electrophoresis; Epidemiology; Flavors; Soils; Intestinal tracts; bacterium; food science; article; bacterium isolation; cheese; cheesemaking; Enterococcus; Enterococcus casseliflavus; enterococcus durans; Enterococcus faecalis; food contamination; milk; nonhuman; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; strain identification; Streptococcus bovis; Microorganisms","","Culture Media, ","","","","","Arizcun C., Barcina Y., Torre P., Identification and characterization of proteolytic activity of Enterococcus ssp. isolated from milk and Roncal and Idiazabal cheese, Int.

For food, colour is ranked alongside freshness as one of the main criteria governing selection.Naturally occurring carotenoid pigments, such as astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, may be applied in animal feed so that the resulting food products are appealing to the consumer. Whilst arguably, these pigments may be seen to be of cosmetic value, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin are both known to exert benefits on animal health and welfare. Evidence suggests that carry-over of these pigments into the human food chain could also be beneficial to human health too. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Ochratoxin A is a widely distributed mycotoxin with nephrotoxic activity. It constitutes a new restrictive agent for the export of vinicultural products and is thus important from an economic as well as a scientific point of view. In this study the determination of ochratoxin A in Greek wines was made by means of commercial immunoaffinity columns for purification followed by HPLC with fluorescence detection for quantification of the toxin. The method was applied to 28 dry wines (14 red, 13 white, one rosé) and seven sweet wines (three red, four white) obtained by various viticultural and oenological practices. The levels of ochratoxin A ranged from <0.02 to 3.2ngml-1, with sweet wines containing higher levels than dry wines. Most of the wines contained relatively low concentrations of ochratoxin A (0.02-0.5ngml-1), which do not represent a serious risk to consumer health. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Greek wines; HPLC; Immunoaffinity columns; Mycotoxin; Ochratoxin A","food science","","","","","","","Krogh P., Causal associations of mycotoxic nephropathy, Acta Path Microbiol Scand Suppl, 269, pp. 6-28, (1978); Van der Merwe K.J., Steyn P.S., Fourie L., Scoot D.B., Theron J.J., Ochratoxin A, a toxic metabolite produced by Aspergillus ochraceus Wilh, Nature, 205, pp. 1112-1113, (1965); Van der Merwe K.J., Steyn P.S., Fourie L., The constitution of ochratoxin A, B and C, metabolites of Aspergilus ochraceus Wilh, J Chem Soc, pp. 7083-7088, (1965); Majerus P., Cutka I., Dreyer A., El-Dessouki S., Eyrich W., Reusch H., Schurer B., Waiblinger H.U., Zur Belastungssituation von Ochratoxin A in Lebensmitteln pflanzlichen Ursprungs, Dtsch Lebensm Rundsch, 89, pp. 112-114, (1993); Hohler D., Ochratoxin A in food and feed: Occurrence, legislation and mode of action, Z Ernährungswiss, 37, pp. 2-12, (1998); Moss M.O., Mode of formation of ochratoxin A, Food Addit Contam, 13, SUPPL., pp. 5-9, (1996); Scudamore K.A., Patel S., Breeze V., Surveillance of stored grain from the 1997 harvest in the United Kingdom for ochratoxin A, Food Addit Contam, 16, pp. 281-290, (1999); Survey of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in cereals and retail products, Food Surveillance Info Sheet 130, (1997); Kuiper-Goodman T., Scott P.M., Risk assessment of the mycotoxin ochratoxin A, Biomed Environ Sci, 2, pp. 179-248, (1989); Studer-Rohr I., Dissertation No 11071, (1995); Creppy E.E., Human ochratoxicosis, J Toxicol - Toxin Rev, 18, pp. 277-293, (1999); Ochratoxin A - Toxicological Evaluation of Certain Food Additives and Contaminants, Vol 35 of WHO Food Additives Series, 35, pp. 363-376, (1996); Krogh P., Hald B., Plestina R., Ceovic S., Balkan endemic nephropathy and foodborne ochratoxin A: Preliminary results of a survey of foodstuffs, Acta Path Microbiol Scand, 85, pp. 238-240, (1977); Pavlovic M., Plestina M., Krogh P., Ochratoxin A contamination of foodstuffs in an area with Balkan (endemic) nephropathy, Acta Path Microbiol Scand, 87, pp. 243-246, (1979); Some naturally occurring substances: Food items and constituents, heterocyclic aromatic amines and mycotoxins, IARC Monogr Eval Carcin Risk Humans, 56, pp. 489-521, (1993); Statement on Ochratoxin A in Dried Vine Fruits, (1997); Visconti A., Pascale M., Centonze G., Determination of ochratoxin A in domestic and imported beers in Italy by immunoaffinity clean-up and liquid chromatography, J Chromatogr A, 888, pp. 321-326, (2000); Zimmerli B., Dick R., Determination of ochratoxin A at the ppt level in human blood, serum, milk and some foodstuffs by high-performance liquid chromatography with enhanced fluorescence detection and immunoaffinity column cleanup: Methodology and Swiss data, J Chromatogr B, 666, pp. 85-99, (1995); Tateo F., Bononi M., Lubian E., Etude sur l'ochratoxine A dans les vins.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities as an endogenous and exogenous cell defense mechanism include the potential use in treating various diseases, improving the potential use in treating various diseases, and improving food-stuffs preparation dietary supplements human nutrition. Published work indicates that SOD regulates oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidation in cells. It can prevent lipid peroxidation, the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein in macrophages, lipid droplets' formation, and the adhesion of inflammatory cells into endothelial monolayers. It also expresses antioxidant effects in numerous cancer-related processes. Additionally, different forms of SOD may also augment food processing and pharmaceutical applications, exhibit anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, and prevent arterial problems by protecting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Many investigations in this review have reported the therapeutic ability and physiological importance of SOD. Because of their antioxidative effects, SODs are of great potential in the medicinal, cosmetic, food, farming and chemical industries. This review discusses the findings of human and animal studies that support the advantages of SOD enzyme regulations to reduce the formation of oxidative stress in various ways. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Antioxidant; cancer; dietary supplement; food science; human nutrition; superoxide dismutase","Animals; Antioxidants; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides; Antioxidants; Chemical industry; Cytology; Dietary supplements; Diseases; Food processing; Muscle; Nutrition; Oxidation; Oxidative stress; Vitamins; antioxidant; hydrogen peroxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide; superoxide dismutase; Cancer; Cellular conditions; Food science; Health benefits; Human nutrition; Reactive oxygen species; Super oxide dismutase; Superoxide anions; Superoxide dismutase activities; Superoxide dismutases; animal; human; metabolism; oxidative stress; Superoxide dismutase","","hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; superoxide, 11062-77-4; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; Antioxidants, ; Hydrogen Peroxide, ; Reactive Oxygen Species, ; Superoxide Dismutase, ; Superoxides, ","","","Higher Education Commision, Pakistan, HEC","Authors are thankful to the higher education commission of Pakistan.

The aim of this work was to follow the PPO activity and phenolic content of minimally processed apple (cv 'Jonagored') during cold storage and to establish a potential relationship with enzymatic browning. Increasing storage time of minimally processed apple seemed to result in an increase in PPO activity. No changes (P > 0.05) in total phenolic content were observed during storage. Colour degradation of apple cubes, as indicated by changes in colour parameters, was found to be highly correlated with PPO activity. Browning of 'Jonagored' apple cubes during storage was found to be moderately correlated with PPO activity. No correlation was found between the browning index and the total phenolic content. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","'Jonagored'; Browning; Malus pumila; Phenolic content; Phenols; Polyphenoloxidase; Storage","Malus pumila; Malus x domestica; food science; fruit","","","","","","","Barrett D.M., Lee C.Y., Liu F.W., Changes in 'Delicious' apple browning and softening during controlled atmosphere storage, J Food Qual, 14, pp. 443-445, (1991); Zocca A., Ryugo K., Changes in polyphenoloxidase activity and substrate levels in maturing 'Golden Delicious' apple and other cultivars, HortScience, 10, pp. 586-587, (1975); Coseteng M.Y., Lee C.Y., Changes in apple polyphenoloxidase and polyphenol concentrations in relation to degree of browning, J Food Sci, 52, pp. 985-989, (1987); Klein B.P., Relationship of harvest date, storage conditions, and fruit characteristics to bruise susceptibility of apple, J Am Soc Hort Sci, 112, pp. 113-116, (1987); Brecht J.K., Physiology of lightly processed fruits and vegetables, HortScience, 30, pp. 18-21, (1995); Lattanzio V., Cardinali A., Palmieri S., The role of phenolics in the postharvest physiology of fruits and vegetables: Browning reactions and fungal diseases, Ital J Food Sci, 1, pp. 3-22, (1994); Rolle R.S., Chism G.W., Physiological consequences of minimally processed fruits and vegetables, J Food Qual, 10, pp. 157-177, (1987); Burda S., Oleszek W., Lee C.Y., Phenolic compounds and their changes in apples during maturation and cold storage, J Sci Food Agric, 38, pp. 945-948, (1990); Vamos-Vigyazo L., Gajzago I., Nadudvari-Markus V., Mihalyi K., Studies into the enzymic browning and the polyphenolpolyphenol oxidase complex of apple cultivars, Confructa, 21, pp. 24-35, (1976); Kahn V., Effect of proteins, protein hydrolyzates and amino acids on o-dihydroxyphenolase activity of polyphenol oxidase of mushroom, avocado and banana, J Food Sci, 50, pp. 111-115, (1985); Whitaker J.R., Effect of substrate concentration on rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, Principles of Enzymology, (1994); Amiot M.J., Tacchini M., Aubert S., Nicolas J., Phenolic composition and browning susceptibility of various apple cultivars at maturity, J Food Sci, 57, pp. 958-962, (1992); Amiot M.J., Aubert S., Nicolas J., Phenolic composition and browning susceptibility of various apple and pear cultivars at maturity, Acta Hort, 343, pp. 67-71, (1993); Martinez M.V., Whitaker J.R., The biochemistry and control of enzymatic browning, Trends Food Sci Technol, 6, pp. 195-200, (1995); Walker J.R., Studies on the enzymic browning of apple fruit, NZ J Food Sci, 5, (1962); Wardowski W.F., Brown G.E., Postharvest decay control recommendations for Florida citrus fruit, Circular 952, (1991); Francis F.J., Colour quality evaluation of horticultural crops, HortScience, 15, pp. 58-59, (1980); Galeazzi M.A.M., Sagarbieri V.C.J., Constantidines S.M., Isolation, purification and physicochemical characterization of polyphenoloxidase from a dwarf variety of banana (Musa cavendishii, L), J Food Sci, 46, pp. 150-155, (1981); Folin D., Ciocalteau V., On tyrosine and tryptophan determinations in proteins, J Biol Chem, 73, pp. 627-650, (1927); Singleton V.L., Rossi J.A., Colorimetry of total phenolics with phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic acid reagents, Am J Enol Vitic, 16, pp. 144-158, (1965); Wrolstad R.E., Color and pigment analyses in fruit products, Station Bull No 624, (1976); Bradford M.M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantification of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein binding, Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254, (1976); Davis B.J., Disk electrophoresis. 2.

One of the main advantages of ISPs for the food industry is that they are fairly active in very low amounts, which could make these new food ingredients very cost-effective. Therefore, ISPs have gained much attention in food science and their use has become more and more feasible. ISPs have been discovered in many cold tolerating biological systems such as fish, insects and plants, which all exhibit ice recrystallization inhibition, and also in some cases, thermal hysteresis and ice nucleating activities. This review discusses cold stress and cold tolerance in plants, different mechanisms of actions of ISPs and homologies to other structurally identified proteins, which lead to the dual role of ISPs in plants as ice recrystallization inhibitors and pathogenesis-related proteins or enzymes. Ice crystallization and recrystallization (growth of larger ice crystals at the cost of ""restructuring"" of other ones), interaction of ice crystal and ISPs, ice recrystallization inhibition and thermal hysteresis assays, and application of ISPs in different food products are also discussed. To-date there is no data available to report toxicity or to challenge the safety of these ""novel"" food ingredients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Antifreeze activity assays; Antifreeze proteins; Cold stress; Ice crystallization recrystallization; Ice structuring proteins; Plants","Hexapoda; Food preservatives; Food products; Food storage; Hysteresis; Proteins; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Stainless steel; Thermal processing (foods); Antifreeze activities; Antifreeze protein; Cold stress; Cold tolerance; Different mechanisms; Dual role; Food applications; Food industries; Food ingredients; Food science; Frozen food; Ice crystallization; Ice crystals; Mechanism of action; Nucleating activity; Pathogenesis-related proteins; Plants; Thermal hysteresis; Ice","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors would like to thank Drs.

There is a great body of compelling evidence showing that these metabolites have pronounced potentials for regulating and modulating human health and disease onset, as shown by both experimental and epidemiological approaches. Concurrently, enormous efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanism of actions underlying their biological and physiological functions. For example, the pioneering work of Tachibana et al. uncovered the receptor for (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg) as the 67 kDa laminin receptor, which was shown to partially mediate the functions of EGCg, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-proliferative activities. Thereafter, several protein kinases were identified as binding proteins of flavonoids, including myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Isothiocyanates, sulfur-containing phytochemicals present in cruciferous plants, are well known to target Keap1 for activating the transcription factor Nrf2 for inducing self-defensive and anti-oxidative gene expression. In addition, we recently identified CD36 as a cell surface receptor for ursolic acid, a triterpenoid ubiquitously occurring in plants. Importantly, the above mentioned target proteins are indispensable for phytochemicals to exhibit, at least in part, their bioactivities. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that some of the activities and potential toxicities of metabolites are exerted via their interactions with unidentified, off-target proteins. This notion may be supported by the fact that even rationally designed drugs occasionally display off-target effects and induce unexpected outcomes, including toxicity. Here we update the current status and future directions of research related to target molecules of food phytochemicals. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antioxidants; Food Technology; Food, Fortified; Functional Food; Health Promotion; Humans; Polyphenols; Stress, Physiological; Sulfur Compounds; Terpenes; Cell membranes; Fatty acids; Metabolites; Molecules; Phenols; Sulfur; Transcription factors; antioxidant; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; polyphenol; sulfur derivative; terpene; Anti-inflammatories; Anti-proliferative; Binding proteins; Cell surface receptors; Cruciferous plants; Current status; Environmental stressors; Epigallocatechin-3-gallate; Food science; Human health; Isothiocyanates; Kaempferol; Laminin; Mechanism of action; Myricetin; Physiological functions; Phytochemicals; Protein kinase; Secondary metabolites; Target molecule; Target proteins; Triterpenoids; Ursolic acid; animal; diet supplementation; food handling; functional food; health promotion; human; metabolism; methodology; physiological stress; review; Toxicity","","polyphenol, 37331-26-3; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal, ; Antioxidants, ; Polyphenols, ; Sulfur Compounds, ; Terpenes, ","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (10J03355, 23580164)","","Swinbanks D., O'Brien J., Nature, 364, (1993); Boue S.M., Cleveland T.E., Carter-Wientjes C., Shih B.Y., Bhatnagar D., McLachlan J.M., Burow M.E., J.

The fillets were obtained from three groups of fish fed experimental diets containing either fish oil (FO), soybean oil (SO) or linseed oil (LO). Muscle fatty acid composition was shown to be influenced by diet. Thirty-one odorous compounds were detected by gas chromatography/olfactometry (frequency-of-detection method). Most of these compounds were formed by the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Independently of diet, (E)-2-pentenal, (E)-2-pentenol and (E)-2-hexenol contribute strongly to the odour of brown trout. (E,Z)-2,4-Heptadienal was detected with high frequency in fish fed diets containing high levels of n-3 PUFAs (FO and LO groups). Hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal and 2-nonanol seem to contribute most to the odour of fish fed diets containing vegetable oils. Many odorous compounds were derived from the oxidation of mono- and di-unsaturated fatty acids, which could be promoted by high levels of PUFAs. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Brown trout; Odour-active compounds;

Beside plants and animals, other important food sources are made by microorganisms, typically products of fermentation (e.g bread, wine, beer, soy sauce, etc). Nowadays, because of the increasing environmental pollution, climate change and population growth, is becoming challenging to keep the food supply safe, nutritious and sustainable. Importantly, the development of the synthetic biology field enable the engineering of cells that can be used in food manufacturing. These engineered cells can transform renewable raw materials into important food components, functional food additives and nutritional chemicals. This review discusses the major challenges in food industry and how synthetic biology has the potential to revolutionize the future of the food. Finally, the prospects and challenges of synthetic biology for a sustainable food manufacturing are discussed. © 2021","Food science; Future food; Synthetic biology; Synthetic biotechnology; Synthetic food; Traditional food industry","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21808084, 31930085, 32021005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0900300, 2020YFA0908300); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32021005 , 31930085 , 21808084 ), and the key research and development program of China ( 2018YFA0900300 , 2020YFA0908300 ).","Albermann C., High versus low level expression of the lycopene biosynthesis genes from Pantoea ananatis in Escherichia coli, Biotechnol.

The current study has aimed to identify and analyze the manuscripts on dietary natural products and their potential to influence health and disease including studies using animal models. Data, including words from titles and abstracts, publication and citation data, have been extracted from Web of Science database and analyzed by the VOSviewer software. Our search has yielded 1,014 manuscripts. The ratio of original articles to reviews was identified to be 1.5:1. Over half of the manuscripts have been published since 2010. The manuscripts have been contributed by 4,301 authors from 1,445 organizations in 76 countries/territories and published in 499 journals. The results from the current study point out that scientific research focusing on the potential of dietary natural products to affect health and disease status (including animal model studies) is expanding, and suggests an increasing significance of this scientific area. With the progressive development and improvement of animal studies, it should be expected that animal models of different human diseases (especially civilization ones) would be an integral part of the research for the evaluation of pharmaceuticals originated from dietary natural products like plants or plant materials. Moreover, natural products can also be fed to animals to improve the quality of animal products, with numerous resulting functional effects. © 2018, Polish Academy of Sciences.

This study investigated the influence of NaCl addition (0-300. mM) on the fibril assembly of soy 7S globulins (β-conglycinin), induced by heating at 80 °C and pH 2.0, with the aim of confirming the improvement of their fibril assembly by electrostatic screening. The formed fibril formation was investigated by using Th T fluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. Heat-induced structure changes were traced by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). The results indicated that the whole fibril assembly experienced protein dissociation/hydrolysis and subsequent fibrillization process, and increasing NaCl concentration progressively increased the amount of formed fibrils, and even fibril length. AFM analyses confirmed that the increase in NaCl concentration shortened the time at which the short fibrils were visually observed, and the morphology of formed fibrils, including height of fibrils, width at half-height, and coil periodicity, slightly varied with the added NaCl concentration. The CD analyses indicated that increasing NaCl concentration greatly favored formation of β-type secondary structure, as well as extensive disruption of tertiary and/or quaternary conformations. These results confirmed that the electrostatic screening greatly improved the heat-induced fibril assembly process of soy β-conglycinin at pH 2.0. The improvement of fibril formation was largely attributed to increased extent of conformational changes at higher ionic strength. These findings would provide important information about the fibril assembly of plant oligomeric globulins at acidic pH that have important implications for the development of protein protein-based fibrillar gels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Assembly; Electrostatic screening; Fibrillization; Protein fibril; Soy β-conglycinin","Assembly; Atomic force microscopy; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Concentration (process); Diffusers (optical); Electrophoresis; Electrostatics; Ionic strength; Oligomers; Sodium; Sodium chloride; Sodium sulfate; Acidic conditions; Acidic pH; AFM; Assembly process; Complex structure; Conformational change; Conglycinin; Electrostatic screening; Fibril formation; Fibrillar gel; Fibrillization; Food science; NaCl concentration; Protein fibril; Protein fibrils; SDS-PAGE; Secondary structures; Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Structure change; Proteins","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, (30972049, 31171632); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University, (NCET-10-0398); South China University of Technology, (2009220034, 2011ZG0019); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (serial numbers: 30972049 and 31171632 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SCUT; serial numbers: 2009220034 and 2011ZG0019 ) and Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University ( NCET-10-0398 ).

Moreover, these microorganisms are also known for their role as probiotics. The potential of nsLAB is huge; however, there are still challenges to be overcome with respect to characterization and application. In the present review, the most important steps that autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented foods need to overcome, to qualify as novel starter cultures, or as probiotics, in food technology and biotechnology, are considered. These different characterization steps include precise identification, detection of health-promoting properties, and safety evaluation. Each of these features is strain specific and needs to be accurately determined.

These models are useful tools for fruit and vegetable monitoring; grading and classification; modeling the respiration rate; predicting and modeling quality properties; modeling of microbial growth; and forecasting chemical, physical, and sensorial characteristics during processing and postharvest storage. These models hold an enormous deal of promise for modeling difficult task;s in practice control and simulation and in the use of machine perception including machine vision system and electronic nose for fruit and vegetable quality control. In addition, these models were used for different fruit and vegetable storage process modeling, for detecting chilling injury, to detect defects, for controlling various drying process, and for improving climate control.

In this view, the amount of selected color components of 145 commercial red wines (total wine color, polymeric pigments, total anthocyanins, and copigmentation index) was investigated using Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression. The feasibility of several preprocessing algorithms (first and second derivative, standard normal variate, and direct orthogonal signal correction) was compared in terms of coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean square error of prediction using an independent test set of wines. The composition of red wines showed great difference in terms of total color (5. 07 ± 1. 95 AU at 520 nm) compared to copigmentation index (0. 66 ± 0. 58 AU at 520 nm). The best prediction model was obtained using direct orthogonal signal correction (DOSC) preprocessing. In particular, the prediction of total wine color, total anthocyanins, and polymeric pigments showed a good fitting (R 2 ≥ 0. 82), whereas copigmentation index was more difficult to be predicted by FTIR (R 2 = 0. 57). This preliminary study showed the potential of MIR spectroscopy with DOSC-PLS algorithm to successfully analyze selected color components of red wine on a large number of samples in short time with almost no sample preparation and no chemical waste is created. © 2011 9Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Chemometrics; DOSC; Infrared spectroscopy; PLS; Wine","Algorithms; Chemical analysis; Color; Forecasting; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Mathematical models; Phenols; Polymers; Wine; Chemometrics; Coefficient of determination; Color component; Copigmentation; DOSC; Food science; FTIR; FTIR spectroscopy; Method of analysis; Mid-infrared spectroscopy; MIR spectroscopy; Number of samples; Orthogonal signal correction; Partial least-squares regression; Phenolic compounds; PLS; Pre-processing algorithms; Prediction model; Product quality; Red wine; Root-mean-square error of predictions; Sample preparation; Second derivatives; Speed-ups; Standard normal variates; Test sets; Wine color; Anthocyanins","","","","","","","Andersson C.A., Chemometr Intell Lab Syst, 47, (1999); Arzberger U., Lachenmeier D.W., Food Anal Methods, 1, (2008); Bauer R., Nieuwoudt H.H., Bauer F.F., Kossmann J., Koch K.R., Esbensen K.H., Anal Chem, 80, (2008); Boulton R.B., Singleton V.L., Bisson L.F., Kunkee R.E., Principles and Practices of Winemaking, (1996); Boulton R.B., Neri R., Levengood J., Vaadia M., Proceedings of the 6th Symposium International d' Œnologie, (1999); Cocciardi R.A., Ismail A.A., Sedman J., J Agric Food Chem, 53, (2005); Cotes J., Interpretation of Infrared Spectra, a Practical Approach, (2000); Cozzolino D., Kwiatkowski M.J., Parker M., Cynkar W.U., Dambergs R.G., Gishen M., Herderich M.J., Anal Chim Acta, 513, (2004); Edelmann A., Lendl B., J Am Chem Soc, 124, (2002); Edelmann A., Diewok J., Schuster K.C., Lendl B., J Agric Food Chem, 49, (2001); Esbensen K., Schonkopf S., Midtgaard T., Guyot D., Multivariate Analysis in Practice, (1998); Faber K., Kowalski B., Appl Spectrosc, 51, (1997); Fearn T., Chemom Intell Lab Syst, 50, (2000); Fernandez K., Agosin E., J Agric Food Chem, 55, (2007); Fragoso S., Acena L., Guasch J., Busto O., Mestres M., J Agric Food Chem, 59, (2011); Gawel R., Austr J Grape Wine Res, 4, (1998); Gishen M., Cozzolino D., Dambergs R.G., Austr J Grape Wine Res, 11, (2005); Harbertson J.F., Spayd S., Am J Enol Vitic, 57, (2006); Harbertson J.F., Picciotto E.A., Adams D.O., Am J Enol Vitic, 54, (2003); Lachenmeier D.W., Godelmann R., Steiner M., Ansay B., Weigel J., Krieg G., Chem Cent J, 4, (2010); Landon J.L., Weller K., Harbertson J.F., Ross C.F., Am J Enol Vitic, 59, (2008); Lleti R., Melendez E., Ortiz M.C., Sarabia L.A., Sanchez M.S., Anal Chim Acta, 544, (2005); Luypaert J., Heuerding S., de Jong S., Massart D.L., J Pharm Biomed Anal, 30, (2002); Martens H., Martens M., Multivariate Analysis of Quality.

This paper is the first in a themed issue of the Journal in which a number of papers have been brought together in order to demonstrate the types and variety of immunoassays, which are currently available. Indeed it might be said that all an analyst needs to do is to name a molecule and somewhere there will now be an immunoassay for the detection of that molecule. This obviously is not entirely accurate, however immunoassays do provide a powerful tool, which can be used in the analysis and quality control of food materials. For both the novice and the experienced worker the specialist terminology of a subject presents an initial barrier, which must be overcome before full understanding is achieved. In this paper an attempt is made to introduce the important terms with which the reader should be familiar and to try to set the various technologies in context. The various basic methods are described and the theoretical and practical basis of more sophisticated assays now being devised are introduced.","Antibodies; Environment; Food; Immunoassay; Quality; Safety","Bovinae; Accident prevention; Antibodies; Antigens; DNA; Food processing; Immunology; Polysaccharides; Antibody production; Bovine serum albumin (BSA); Food science; Immunoassays; Bioassay","","","","","","","Allen J.C., Smith C.J., Enzyme-linked immunoassay kits for routine food analysis, Trends in Biotechnology, 5, pp. 193-199, (1987); Ayob M.K., Smith C.J., Immunoassay techniques for food analysis, Sains Malaysiana, 19, pp. 1-28, (1990); Baxter G.A., O'Connor M.C., Haughey S.A., Crooks S.R.H., Elliott C.T., Evaluation of an immuno-biosensor for the on-site testing of veterinary drug residues at an abattoir.

Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity was highest in the drought tolerant 'Assam' cultivar UPASI-2, followed by UPASI-8 and UPASI-9, under non-stress conditions. Under soil moisture stress a reduction in PAL activity was found in all three clones investigated. A strong positive correlation was observed between an increase in soil moisture deficit and a decrease in PAL activity. Lower PAL activity correlated well with lower synthesis of flavanols such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG), which are important precursors of theaflavin-3, 3′-digallate that determines final tea quality. Altered synthesis of EGCG and ECG could be due to their molecular rearrangement at elevated leaf temperature during drought. Synthesis of quality constituents such as gallic acid and caffeine declined significantly owing to both drought and waterlogging stress. The reduction in gallic acid due to water stress could lead to lower synthesis of theaflavin fractions such as epitheaflavic acid, epitheaflavic acid-3′-gallate and theaflavic acid and, thereby, quality deterioration. Similarly to drought, flooding stress was also found to alter the biochemical constituents necessary for tea quality. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Caffeine; Epicatechin; Epicatechin gallate; Epigallocatechin; Epigallocatechin gallate; Gallic acid; Phenylalanine ammonia lyase","Camellia sinensis; biochemistry; food science; tea","","","","","","","Satyanarayana N., Alleviation of drought stress in tea, Bull UPASI Tea Sci Dept, 46, pp. 72-73, (1993); Venkatesalu V., Manivel L., Raj Kumar R., Effect of antitranspirants in tea, J Plantation Crops, 21, pp. 366-371, (1993); Rajasekar R., Spurgeon C., Satyanarayana N., Evaluation of certain morphological and physiological factors in tea (Camellia L. spp.) cultivars under water stress, J Plantation Crops, 18, pp. 83-92, (1988); Marimuthu S., Raj Kumar R., Drought management in tea: A physiological approach, Bull UPASI Tea Sci Dept, 51, pp. 16-18, (1998); Manivel L., Raj Kumar R., Marimuthu S., Guidelines on foliar application of NK and plant growth regulators in tea, Handbook of Tea Culture.

In this study, we performed discrimination of five different mango cultivars, Awin, Carabao, Keitt, Kent, and Nam Dok Mai, using metabolic analysis with band-selective excitation NMR spectra. A combination of unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) with low-field region 1H NMR spectra obtained by band-selective excitation provided a good discriminant model of the five mango cultivars. Using F 2-selective 2D NMR spectra, we also identified various minor components in the mango juice. Signal assignment of the minor components facilitated the interpretation of the loading plot, and it was found that arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, glutamine, shikimic acid, and trigonelline were important for classification of the five mango cultivars. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","mango; metabolic profiling; NMR; nondestructive analysis; selective excitation","Beverages; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mangifera; Metabolome; Principal Component Analysis; Carboxylic acids; Metabolism; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 2D NMR spectra; Discriminant models; Food science; H NMR spectra; Low-field region; mango; Mango juices; Metabolic analysis; Metabolic profiling; Minor components; NMR spectrum; Non destructive; Selective excitations; Shikimic acids; Trigonelline; article; beverage; chemistry; classification; evaluation; Mangifera; metabolism; metabolome; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; principal component analysis; Amino acids","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (23228003); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","","Mafra I., Ferreira I.M.P.L.V.O., Oliveira M.B.P.P., Food authentication by PCR-based methods, European Food Research and Technology, 227, 3, pp. 649-665, (2008); Benincasa C., Lewis J., Sindona G., Tagarelli A., The use of multi element profiling to differentiate between cow and buffalo milk, Food Chem., 110, pp. 257-262, (2008); Jamin E., Gonzalez J., Remaud G., Naulet N., Martin G.G., Detection of Exogenous Sugars or Organic Acids Addition in Pineapple Juices and Concentrates by <sup>13</sup>C IRMS Analysis, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 45, 10, pp. 3961-3967, (1997); Defernez M., Kemsley E.K., Wilson R.H., Use of Infrared Spectroscopy and Chemometrics for the Authentication of Fruit Purees, J.

The conventional approaches used to acquire bioactive peptides require complicated procedures involving enzymolysis, separation and identification. So far, data-driven computing methods have become an important tool for the screening, design and mechanism exploration of bioactive peptides. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), a quantitative method used to describe the structure-activity relationship of compounds, has been widely used in drug design, material science, and chemistry; however, there are limited applications in food science. Scope and approach: Here, we mainly focus on technologies used to perform QSAR modeling in peptides, including dataset collection, structural characterization, variable selection, correlation methods, and model validation and evaluation. We also summarize the recent applications, situations, challenges and prospects of the use of QSAR in food-derived bioactive peptides. Key findings and conclusions: Researchers should make full use of the benefits of QSAR as well as face its challenges. Multiple new methods or combination strategies should be used to achieve QSAR analysis. Much research is needed to improve the knowledge of QSAR in order to discover bioactive peptides. The solution to this task requires multidisciplinary cooperation in multiple fields, including chemistry, computer science, mathematics and, of course, food science. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bioinformatics; Functional food; Modeling; Peptide; Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)","Bioinformatics; Computational chemistry; Correlation methods; Functional food; Molecular graphics; Structural design; Structures (built objects); Antibacterial effects; Antihypertensive effect; Antioxidant effect; Antitumor effect; Bioactive peptides; Food science; Food-derived peptides; Modeling; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Quantitative structure-activity relationship; Peptides","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31571782, 31771975); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (cstc2018jcyjAX0765)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31771975 and 31571782 ), and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing CSTC (No. cstc2018jcyjAX0765 ).

Sensory scores presented high values of repeatability (≥ 0.70). The Principal Component Analysis of sensorial parameters revealed that Factor 1, accounting for a 95% of the variation and linked to storage duration, displayed homogenous behaviour. An antithesis between descriptors of external characteristics of fish and those relative to internal parts was observed, particularly in the intermediate phase of the shelf life, during which storage temperature played a discriminating role. The PCA of the sensorial and instrumental parameters together showed that the parameters most correlated with the first factor (83% of overall variance) were the sensorial ones (loading scores >0.96), K1 freshness index, rigor index and dielectric properties (loading scores = -0.96, 0.73 and 0.71, respectively). Data suggest that the external characteristics of the fish alone could be used to measure freshness. The K1, rigor index and dielectrics properties could be used as objective measures of freshness. Sensory ratings are less powerful for freshness analysis at the later stages of shelf life. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A total of 485 ponds were sampled during a 1-week period; sample collections were weighted to reflect state area in production. Over 47% of ponds had detectable toxin concentrations, although less than 10% of ponds exceeded 1 ng/ml microcystin. MIB and/or geosmin off-flavors occurred in 25% of the samples. Beta-cyclocitral was detected in over 98% of ponds, and was strongly correlated with presence of myxoxanthin (r=0.94) and zeaxanthin (r=0.82), both indicative of cyanobacterial production of this compound. Off-flavor compounds (geosmin and MIB) were correlated to a lesser degree with zeaxanthin production (r=0.78), whereas aphanizyphyl was better correlated with MIB and geosmin (r=0.89 and 0.56, respectively), again suggesting cyanobacterial production of these compounds. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Acylation of the glycosyl moieties of anthocyanins, however, changes the chemical properties of anthocyanins and provides enhanced stability. Thus, acylated anthocyanins are more usable as natural colorants and bioactive components of innovative functional foods. Acylated anthocyanins are common in pigmented vegetables and tubers, the consumption of which has the potential to increase the intake of health-promoting anthocyanins as part of the daily diet. For the first time, this review presents the current findings on bioavailability, absorption, metabolism, and health effects of acylated anthocyanins with comparison to more extensively investigated nonacylated anthocyanins. The structural differences between nonacylated and acylated anthocyanins lead to enhanced color stability, altered absorption, bioavailability, in vivo stability, and colonic degradation. The impact of phenolic metabolites and their potential health effects regardless of the low bioavailability of the parent anthocyanins as such is discussed. Here, purple-fleshed potatoes are presented as a globally available, eco-friendly model food rich in acylated anthocyanins, which further highlights the industrial possibilities and nutritional relevance of acylated anthocyanins. This work supports the academic community and industry in food research and development by reviewing the current literature and highlighting gaps of knowledge. © 2021 The Authors.

Catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) by these strains contributes to aroma formation by production of methyl-branched aldehydes and carboxy acids. The first step in the catabolism is most likely a transamination reaction catalyzed by BCAA aminotransferases (IlvE proteins). In this study, we cloned the ilvE gene from S. carnosus by using degenerate oligonucleotides and PCR. We found that the deduced amino acid sequence was 80% identical to that of the corresponding enzyme in Staphylococcus aureus and that the ilvE gene was constitutively expressed as a monocistronic transcript. To study the influence of ilvE on BCAA catabolism, we constructed an ilvE deletion mutant by gene replacement. The IlvE protein from S. carnosus was shown mainly to catalyze the transamination of isoleucine, valine, leucine, and, to some extent, methionine using pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a coenzyme. The ilvE mutant degraded less than 5% of the BCAAs, while the wild-type strain degraded 75 to 95%. Furthermore, the mutant strain produced approximately 100-fold less of the methyl-branched carboxy acids, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, and 3-methylbutanoic acid, which derived from the BCAA catabolism, clearly emphasizing the role of IlvE in aroma formation. In contrast to previous reports, we found that IlvE was the only enzyme that catalyzed the deamination of BCAAs in S. carnosus. The ilvE mutant strain showed remarkably lower growth rate and biomass yield compared to those of the wild-type strain when grown in rich medium. Normal growth rate and biomass yield were restored by addition of the three BCAA-derived α-keto acids, showing that degradation products of BCAAs were essential for optimal cell growth.","","Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Animals; Cloning, Molecular; Culture Media; Gene Deletion; Genetic Vectors; Meat Products; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Staphylococcus; Transaminases; Bacteria (microorganisms); Posibacteria; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus carnosus; Staphylococcus xylosus; Aldehydes; Amino acids; Biomass; Catalysis; Genes; 2 methylbutyric acid; aldehyde derivative; branched chain amino acid aminotransferase; isobutyric acid; isoleucine; isovaleric acid; leucine; methionine; pyridoxal 5 phosphate; valine; food science; microbiology; amino acid metabolism; amino acid sequence; article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium mutant; biomass; controlled study; culture medium; enzyme inactivation; fermentation; gene construct; gene deletion; gene expression; gene mutation; ilve gene; meat industry; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus carnosus; Staphylococcus xylosus; transamination; Branched chain amino acids; Enzymes","EMBL: AJ279090; GENBANK: AJ279090","Amino Acids, Branched-Chain, ; branched-chain-amino-acid transaminase, EC 2.6.1.42; Culture Media, ; Transaminases, EC 2.6.1.-","","","","","Atiles M.W., Dudley E.G., Steele J.L., Gene cloning, sequencing, and inactivation of the branched-chain aminotransferase of Lactococcus lactis LM0230, Appl.

To estimate the latter, an in vitro dialysis method can be applied that gives the dialysability of a mineral as an estimate of its availability for absorption. Calcium, iron and zinc contents and dialysabilities in three legumes (beans, chickpeas and lentils) and the effects of cooking treatments and industrial processing on these parameters were studied. Beans had the highest calcium content (1.54g kg-1 dry matter (DM)) and chickpeas the lowest iron content (46.9mg kg-1 DM), whilst the zinc contents were similar in all three raw legumes (33.7-36.9mg kg-1 DM). Traditional and microwave cooking reduced the mineral contents by 9.7-36.4% for calcium, 14.2-31% for iron and 11.1-28.9% for zinc. The dialysabilities of calcium with respect to the values for the raw products were also reduced by these cooking techniques. Industrially processed legumes had higher dialysabilities of calcium, iron and zinc than traditionally or microwave cooked legumes. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Beans; Calcium; Chickpeas; Dialysability; Iron; Legumes; Lentils; Processing; Zinc","calcium; chemical and physical properties; concentration (parameters); dialysis; dietary fiber; dry matter; food processing; iron; microwave cooking; zinc; food science","","","","","","","Lopez-Jurado M., Urbano G., Fernandez M.M., Aranda P., Frias J., Sotomayor C., Vidal-Valverde C., Bioavailability of calcium in raw and processed fava beans, Proceedings of International Conference Bioavailability '93.

Twenty good and 20 poor quality tea clones were selected from the breeding programme at the Tea Research Foundation (Central Africa) (TRF(CA)). The theaflavin (TF) composition of the black tea manufactured from each clone was analysed by capillary electrophoresis and correlated with total scores and valuation from two tea tasters with regression analysis. The significance of the differences between the 20 good and 20 poor quality tea clones was determined with the Student t-test and the distribution-free Kruskal-Wallis test. The sum of the TFs of the black tea correlated well (r = 0.785, P = 0.0002) with the value of the tea. Of the individual TFs determined in the black tea, the highest correlation was obtained with TF-3′-monogallate (TF-B) (r = 0.788, P = 0.0016), TF-3-monogallate (TF-A) (r = 0.741, P = 0.0004) and free TF (TF-f) (r = 0.705, P = 0.0002). TF-B (m = 24.90) followed by TF-A (m = 12.48) showed the steepest slopes against value, making them good indicators for value. The TF-digallate (TF-dg) content did not show significant correlation with value (r = 0.316, P = 0.358).

Maple syrup is a soft target for adulterators owing to its simplicity of chemical composition. The use of infrared spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and near-infrared (NIR) as a tool to detect adulterants such as cane and beet invert syrups as well as cane and beet sugar solutions in maple syrup was investigated. The FTIR spectra of adulterated samples were characterised and the regions of 800-1200 cm-1 (carbohydrates) and 1200-1800 and 2800-3200 cm-1 (carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and amino acids) were used for detection. The NIR spectral region between 1100 and 1660 nm was used for analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) were used for discriminant analysis, while partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR) were used for quantitative analysis. FTIR was more accurate in predicting adulteration using the two different regions (R2>0.93 and 0.98) compared with NIR (R2 > 0.93). Classification and quantification of adulterants in maple syrup show that both NIR and FTIR can be used for detecting adulterants such as pure beet and cane sugar solutions, but FTIR was superior to NIR in detecting invert syrups. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Adulteration; Chemometrics; IR spectroscopy; Maple syrup; Sugars","Acer; Arundinaria; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; food science; spectroscopy","","","","","","","Martin G.G., Martin Y.L., Naulet N., McManus H.J.D., Application of <sup>2</sup>H SNIF-NMR and <sup>13</sup>C SIRA-MS analyses to maple syrup: Detection of added sugars, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 3206-3213, (1996); Mollica J.N., Morselli M.F., Sugar and sugar products: Gas chromatographic determination of non-volatile organic acids in sap of sugar, J Assoc Off Anal Chem, 67, pp. 1125-1129, (1984); Morselli M.F., Whalen M.L., Amino acid increase in xylem sap of Acer saccharum prior to bud break, Am J Bot, 73, pp. 722-723, (1986); Wassem M., Phipps J., Carbonneau R., Simmonds J., Plant growth substances in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) spring sap.

An overlooked facet in this representation is that food acquisition is not only geographically dictated, but it is also temporally constrained. Food retailers invariably have limited opening hours that create a temporal restriction for shoppers. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) construct was proposed to delineate the limited food access to a retailer location across space and over its time of operation. Food retailer data in Columbus, OH, USA were collected for examining the variation of food access on both spatial and temporal scales. This study also employed the technique of interactive 3D modeling in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize the food environment to delimit where and when food is accessible on a daily basis. The interactive 3D geovisualization (visualization of geographic information) of space-time access contributed to improving the representation of food environment and exploring the inequity of food access across space and over time. The development of this geovisualization context for food science studies could assist public health professionals and government stakeholders in understanding the effect of temporal access and improving food access for regions with limited operation hours in policy formulation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Food accessibility;

NaL did not seem to affect the heat resistance of Salmonella as much as the effects induced by the other variables studied. An omnibus model for predicting the lethality for given times and temperatures for ground beef matrices within the range studied was developed that reflects the convex survival curves that were observed. However, the standard errors of the predicted lethalities from this models are large, so consequently, a model, specific for predicting the times needed to obtained a lethality of 6.5 log10, was developed, using estimated results of times derived from the individual survival curves. For the latter model, the coefficient of variation (CV) of predicted times range from about 6 to 25%. For example, at 60°C, when increasing the concentration of salt from 0 to 4.5%, and assuming that the concentration of SPP is 0%, the time to reach a 6.5-log10 relative reduction is predicted to increase from 20 min (CV = 11%) to 48 min (CV = 15%), a 2.4 factor (CV = 19%). At 71.1°C (160°F) the model predicts that more than 0.5 min is needed to achieve a 6.5-log10 relative reduction.","","Animals; Bacteriological Techniques; Cattle; Diphosphates; Meat; Models, Biological; Poultry; Regression Analysis; Salmonella; Serotyping; Sodium Chloride; Sodium Lactate; Swine; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Salmonella; Heat resistance; Mathematical models; Reduction; Salts; lactate sodium; pyrophosphate; sodium chloride; food science; microbiology; analytical error; article; bacterial survival; concentration response; food contamination; heat tolerance; lethality; low temperature; meat; nonhuman; prediction; Salmonella; temperature sensitivity; thermal exposure; Thermal inactivation models; Microbiology","","lactate sodium, 72-17-3; pyrophosphate, 14000-31-8, 7722-88-5, 7758-16-9; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Diphosphates, ; Sodium Chloride, 7647-14-5; Sodium Lactate, 72-17-3; sodium pyrophosphate, 7722-88-5","","","","","Augustin J.C., Carlier V., Rozier J., Mathematical modeling of the heat resistance of Listeria monocytogenes, J.

Young pods of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L) were radiolabelled by in vivo feeding of 14CO2, trans-[U-14C]cinnamate or L-[U-14C]phenylalanine. [14C]Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) were extracted with acetone/water (3:1 v/v), isolated on Sephadex LH-20 and fed to rats by gavage. After 4 and 18h, 90-94% of the gavaged 14C was in the gut contents and/or faeces. Much of the gavaged 14C (57%), predominantly that originally in tannins of high degree of polymerisation (DP), became insolubilised, mainly in the form of protein-tannin complexes. Some of the [14C]tannins that remained soluble decreased in DP, especially in the small intestine and caecum. A further fraction (12% of the 14C gavaged) underwent chemical modifications in the gut to form soluble, non-tannin compounds. Small proportions of the 14C were found in the liver (1.0-1.5%), urine (1-2%) and 14CO2 (1-2%). We conclude that proanthocyanidins are not inert within the gut but undergo various modifications which may affect the nutrition of the animal. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carob; Ceratonia siliqua; Digestion; Gut; Proanthocyanidins (<sup>14</sup>C-labelled); Rat; Tannins (condensed)","biodegradability; biological functions; carbon 14; Ceratonia siliqua; concentration (parameters); gastrointestinal tract; nutrition; plant products not classified elsewhere; pod; proanthocyanidin; rat; tannin; tissue distribution; food science","","","","","","","Saura-Calixto F., Canellas J., Components of nutritional interest in carob pods (Ceratonia siliqua), J Sci Food Agric, 33, pp. 1319-1323, (1982); Bravo L., Grados N., Saura-Calixto F., Composition and potential uses of mesquite pods (Prosopis pallida L.): Comparison with carob pods (Ceratonia siliqua L), J Sci Food Agric, 65, pp. 303-306, (1994); Tamir M., Nachtomi E., Alumot E., Degradation of tannins from carob pods (Ceratonia siliqua) by thioglycollic acid, Phytochemistry, 10, pp. 2769-2774, (1971); Naczk M., Oickle D., Pink D., Shahidi F., Protein precipitating capacity of crude canola tannins: Effect of pH, tannin, and protein concentrations, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 2144-2148, (1996); Zhu M., Phillipson J.D., Greengrass P.M., Bowery N.E., Cai Y., Plant polyphenols: Biologically active compounds or non-selective binders to protein?, Phytochemistry, 44, pp. 441-447, (1997); Helsper J.P.F.G., Hoogendijk J.M., Van Norel A., Burger-Meyer K., Antinutritional factors in faba beans (Vicia faba L.) as affected by breeding toward the absence of condensed tannins, J Agric Food Chem, 41, pp. 1058-1061, (1993); Bravo L., Manas E., Saura-Calixto F., Dietary non-extractable condensed tannins as indigestible compounds: Effects on faecal weight, and protein and fat excretion, J Sci Food Agric, 63, pp. 63-68, (1993); Mangan J.L., Nutritional effects of tannins in animal feeds, Nutr Res Rev, 1, pp. 209-231, (1988); Silverstein L.J., Swanson B.G., Moffett D.F., Procyanidin from black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) inhibits nutrient and electrolyte absorption in isolated rat ileum and induces secretion of chloride ion, J Nutr, 126, pp. 1688-1695, (1996); Griffiths D.W., Moseley G., The effect of diets containing field beans of high and low polyphenolic content on the activity of digestive enzymes in the intestine of rats, J Sci Food Agric, 31, pp. 255-259, (1980); Elkin R.G., Freed M.B., Hamaker B.R., Zhang Y., Parsons C.M., Condensed tannins are only partially responsible for variations in nutrient digestibilities of sorghum grain cultivars, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 848-853, (1996); Sato M., Maulik G., Ray P.S., Bagchi D., Das D.K., Cardioprotective effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin against ischemic reperfusion injury, J Mol Cell Cardiol, 31, pp. 1289-1297, (1999); Yamakoshi J., Kataoka S., Koga T., Ariga T., Proanthocyanidin-rich extract from grape seeds attenuates the development of aortic atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits, Atherosclerosis, 142, pp. 139-149, (1999); Rogler J.C., Butler L.C., Enhancement of high tannin sorghum utilisation: Biological effects of dietary tannins, INTSORMIL: Fighting Hunger with Research, (1985); Laparra J., Michaud J., Masquelier J., Pharmacokinetic study of flavanolic oligomers, J Plant Med Phytother, 11, pp. 133-142, (1977); Jimenez-Ramsey L.M., Rogler J.C., Housley T.L., Butler L.G., Elkin R.G., Absorption and distribution of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled condensed tannins and related sorghum phenolics in chickens, J Agric Food Chem, 42, pp. 963-967, (1994); Terril T.H., Waghorn G.C., Woolley D.J., McNabb W.C., Barry T.N., Assay and digestion of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled condensed tannins in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep, Br J Nutr, 72, pp. 467-477, (1994); Levrat M.A., Texier M.D.O., Regerat F., Demigne C., Remesy C., Comparison of the effects of condensed tannin and pectin on cecal fermentation and lipid metabolism in the rat, Nutr Res, 13, pp. 427-433, (1993); Perez-Maldonado R.A., Norton B.W., Digestion of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled condensed tannins from Desmodium intortum in sheep and goats, Br J Nutr, 76, pp. 501-513, (1996); Buchanan C.J., Wallace G., Fry S.C., Eastwood M.A., In vivo release of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled phenolic groups from intact dietary spinach cell walls during passage through the rat intestine, J Sci Food Agric, 71, pp. 459-469, (1996); Strumeyer D.H., Malin M.J., Condensed tannins in grain sorghum: Isolation, fractionation, and characterization, J Agric Food Chem, 23, pp. 909-914, (1975); Thompson R.S., Jacques D., Haslam E., Tanner R.J.N., Plant proanthocyanidins.

SFD is particularly suitable for volatiles, biologicals, and food supplements that are sensitive to process extremities of temperature (SD) and time and cost (FD). Although SFD has been an area of interest to scientists for some time, there have been few very interesting investigations in food science in the recent past, which highlight the versatility and utility of this method, and been discussed in this review. The sources for SFD range from flavor ingredients to vegetables, lipids, enzymes, vitamins, and proteins. The extensive research findings in this domain have been collated in this focused review with the objective of providing the readers an essence of the forays made in this technology and the future possibilities it promises. Practical applications: Spray-freeze-drying is suitable for volatiles, biologicals, and food supplements that are sensitive to process extremities of temperature (spray drying) and time and cost (freeze drying). Applications of SFD range from flavor ingredients to vegetables, lipids, enzymes, vitamins, and proteins. It offers reduced drying time, higher retention of bioactives postdrying, and improved rehydration, which makes it a method of choice. Considering the possibilities that this technique offers, further research on more types of feed is warranted, that would benefit industry and academia both. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Enzymes;

At lower stress amplitude (τo) the values of elastic modulus G′ for weak doughs were higher than those for strong doughs, but they decreased substantially beyond 100 Pa stress amplitude (τo), such that the G′ values for strong doughs crossed over the G′ values for weak doughs. Beyond a critical value of stress amplitude (ie 100 Pa), true differences in dough strengths could be seen on the basis of their elastic characteristics, because at large deformations protein-protein interactions played a more dominant role in the rheological behaviour of flour doughs. Dynamic rheological analysis demonstrated a very weak inverse relationship (R2=0.16) between the G′ values of flour doughs and loaf volume data for 12 wheat cultivars of diverse bread-making performance.

Regression analysis at 95% significance level indicated that reducing effects are likely to be exerted by the flavanol fraction (SF < 0.05), as opposed to antiradical efficiency which is primarily affected by the sum of THC and TF contents (SF < 0.05), suggesting that synergistic phenomena account for the overall antioxidant status of white wines. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Antiradical activity; Flavanols; Hydroxycinnamates; Polyphenols; Reducing power; White wines","food science","","","","","","","Dillard C.D., German J.B., Phytochemicals: Nutraceuticals and human health, J Sci Food Agric, 80, pp. 1744-1756, (2000); Craig W.J., Health-promoting properties of common herbs, Am J Clin Nutr, 70, SUPPL., pp. 491-499, (1999); Lampe J.W., Health effects of vegetables and fruit: Assessing mechanisms of action in human experimental studies, Am J Clin Nutr, 70, SUPPL., pp. 475-490, (1999); Hollman P.C.H., Feskens E.J.M., Katan M.B., Tea flavonols in cardiovascular disease and cancer epidemiology, PSEBM, 220, pp. 112-120, (1999); Wang H., Provan G.J., Helliwell K., Tea flavonoids: Their functions, utilization and analysis, Trends Food Sci Technol, 11, pp. 152-160, (2000); Bravo L., Polyphenols: Chemistry, dietary sources, metabolism, and nutritional significance, Nutr Rev, 56, pp. 317-333, (1998); Cao G., Prior R.L., Red wine in moderation: Potential health benefits independent of alcohol, Nutr Clin Care, 3, pp. 76-82, (2000); Morton L.W., Cacceta R.A.A., Puddey I.B., Croft K.D., Chemistry and biological effects of dietary phenolic compounds: Relevance to cardiovascular disease, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol, 27, pp. 152-159, (2000); Dourtoglou V.G., Makris D.P., Bois-Dounas F., Zonas C., trans-Resveratrol concentration in wines produced in Greece, J Food Compos Anal, 12, pp. 227-233, (1999); Karagiannis S., Economou A., Lanaridis P., Phenolic and volatile composition of wines made from Vitis vinifera cv Muscat Lefko grapes from the Island of Samos, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 5369-5375, (2000); Zoecklein B.W., Fugelsang K.C., Gump B.H., Nury F.S., Production Wine Analysis, pp. 129-168, (1990); Pellegrini N., Simonetti P., Gardana C., Brenna O., Brighenti F., Pietta P., Polyphenol content and total antioxidant activity of Vini Novelli (young red wines), J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 732-735, (2000); Arnous A., Makris D.P., Kefalas P., Effect of principal polyphenolic components in relation to antioxidant characteristics of aged red wines, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 5736-5742, (2001); Drysdale J.W., Munro H.N., Small-scale isolation of ferritin for the assay of the incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled amino acids, Biochem J, 95, pp. 851-858, (1965); Lee B.J., Hendricks D.G., Metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate, deoxyribose and linoleic acid as affected by phytic acid in a model system, J Food Sci, 62, pp. 935-938, (1997); Makris D.P., Rossiter J.T., Heat-induced, metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of quercetin and rutin (quercetin 3-0-rhamnosylglucoside) in aqueous model systems, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 3830-3838, (2000); Tryon C.R., Edwards P.A., Chisholm M.G., Determination of the phenolic content of some French-American hybrid white wines using ultraviolet spectroscopy, Am J Enol Vitic, 39, pp. 5-10, (1988); Somers T.C., Verette E., Pocock K.F., Hydroxycinnamate esters of Vitis vinifera: Changes during white vinification, and effects of exogenous enzymic hydrolysis, J Sci Food Agric, 40, pp. 67-78, (1987); Singleton V.L., Trousdale E., White wine phenolics: Varietal and processing differences as shown by HPLC, Am J Enol Vitic, 34, pp. 27-34, (1983); Singleton V.L., Zaya J., Trousdale E.K., Caftaric and coutaric acids in fruit of Vitis, Phytochemistry, 25, pp. 2127-2133, (1985); Singleton V.L., Zaya J., Trousdale E.K., Compositional changes in ripening grapes: Caftaric and coutaric acids, Vitis, 25, pp. 107-117, (1986); Herrmann K., Occurrence and content of hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid compounds in foods, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 28, pp. 315-347, (1989); Ramey D., Bertrand A., Ough C.S., Singleton V.L., Sanders E., Effects of skin contact temperature on Chardonnay must and wine composition, Am J Enol Vitic, 37, pp. 99-106, (1986); Test S.L., Noble A.C., Schmidt J.O., Effect of pomace contact on Chardonnay musts and wines, Am J Enol Vitic, 37, pp. 133-136, (1986); Cheynier V., Rigaud J., Souquet J.M., Barillere J.M., Moutounet M., Effect of pomace contact and hyperoxidation on the phenolic composition and quality of Grenache and Chardonnay wines, Am J Enol Vitic, 40, pp. 36-42, (1989); Foti M., Piattelli M., Baratta M.T., Ruberto G., Flavonoids, coumarins, and cinnamic acids as antioxidants in a micellar system.

In this study the major non-digestible components of five edible brown and red Spanish marine seaweeds - Fucus vesiculosus. Laminaria digitata (Kombu), Undaria pinnatifida (Wakame), Chondrus crispus (Irish moss) and Porphyra tenera (Nori) - were determined under simulated physiological conditions by an in vitro enzymatic method (Sauro-Calixto F et al, J Agric Food Chem 48:3342-3347 (2000)) developed as an alternative to dietary fibre analysis. Two indigestible fractions, soluble (SIF) and insoluble (IIF), were obtained after enzymatic treatments of seaweeds. SIF amounted to 40-170 g kg-1 algal dry weight. Gravimetric values of IIF were 246-599 g kg-1 and its major components were resistant protein (37-133 g kg-1), minerals ( 13-78 g kg-1) and non-starch polysaccharides plus klason lignin (196-415g kg-1). The total indigestible fraction determined by colorimetry (335-516 g kg-1) was similar to the total dietary fibre content of seaweeds determined previously by the AOAC method. However, the distribution of the soluble and insoluble fractions differed between the two procedures. Estimation of the indigestible fraction of edible seaweeds could be useful from both nutritional and commercial points of view. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Dietary fibre; Edible seaweeds; Indigestible fraction;

However, the low efficiency and instability of lignan production via extraction from plant resources remain to be resolved, indicating the requirement for the development of new procedures for lignan production. The metabolic engineering of lignan-biosynthesizing plants is expected to be most promising for efficient, sustainable, and stable lignan production. This is supported by the recent verification of biosynthetic pathways of major dietary lignans and the exploration of lignan production via metabolic engineering using transiently gene-transfected or transgenic plants. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the biosynthetic pathways, biological activities, and metabolic engineering of lignans and also perspectives in metabolic engineering-based lignan production using transgenic plants for practical application. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","biosynthesis; lignan; metabolic engineering; transgenic plants","Biosynthetic Pathways; Lignans; Metabolic Engineering; Plant Proteins; Plants, Edible; Plants, Genetically Modified; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Genetically modified plants; lignan; vegetable protein; Biosynthesis pathways; Biosynthetic pathway; Food science; Healthy diet; lignan; Non-communicable disease; Transgenic plants; Transgenics; biosynthesis; conference paper; edible plant; genetics; metabolic engineering; metabolism; transgenic plant; Metabolic engineering","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (25440161)","","Chaurasia O.P., Ballabh B., Tayade A., Kumar R., Kumar G.P., Singh S.B., Podophyllum L.: An endangered and anticancerous medicinal plant - An overview, Indian J.

Although many efforts have been devoted to reduce hunger, challenges such as growing competitions for natural resources, emerging climate changes and natural disasters, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases are posing threats to food security and intensifying the hunger crisis. Concerted efforts of scientists to improve agricultural and food productivity, technology, nutrition, and education are imperative to facilitate appropriate strategies for defeating hunger and malnutrition. This paper provides some aspects of world hunger issues and summarizes the efforts and measures aimed to alleviate food problems from the food and nutritional sciences perspectives. The prospects and constraints of some implemented strategies for alleviating hunger and achieving sustainable food security are also discussed. This comprehensive information source could provide insights into the development of a complementary framework for dealing with the global hunger issue. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","food science; food security; food sustainability; Hunger; malnutrition; nutrition","Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Food Handling; Food Supply; Food Technology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Hunger; Malnutrition; Nutritional Sciences; Poverty; World Health; Agriculture; Climate change; Food supply; Comprehensive information; Food productivity; Food science; Food security; Hunger; Implemented strategy; malnutrition; Natural disasters; agriculture; attitude to health; catering service; education; environmental protection; food handling; health; human; hunger; malnutrition; methodology; nutritional science; poverty; review; Nutrition","","","","","","","Planting the rights seed: A human rights perspective on agriculture trade and the WTO, Backgrounder No. 1 in the thread series, (2005); Ali M.H., Talukder M.S.U., Increasing water productivity in crop production-A synthesis, Agric.

The most evident effect in P borealis was the decrease in the relative amount of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and a concomitant increase in the number and intensity of bands of molecular size about 100kDa cross-reacting with anti-MHC antiserum. MHC degradation of P borealis was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of partially isolated native myosin. Other prominent features were the disappearance of bands of about 67 and 50kDa after 24h and the appearance of a band of slightly less than 50kDa after 5h of ice-storage. These last bands showed the potential to be used as freshness markers. One spot tentatively identified as desmin did not suffer significant changes in any of the three species. Two bands (about 100 and 96kDa) gave a positive reaction with the α-actinin antibody in the zero-time extract of P borealis, but after 24h only one faint 96kDa band was detected. In contrast, the extracts of P japonicus and P monodon did not suffer significant alterations during the examined period, and even after 92h of ice-storage only the 100kDa anti-α-actinin cross-reacting band was clearly visible in the high-salt extract of P japonicus. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Electrophoresis; Freshness markers; Ice-storage; Pandalus borealis; Penaeus japonicus; Penaeus monodon; Post mortem degradation; Shrimp; Skeletal muscle","alpha actinin; electrophoresis; food analysis; food storage; freezing; molecular size; muscle protein; myosin heavy chain; Pandalus borealis; Penaeus japonicus; penaeus monodon; protein degradation; salinity; SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; food science","","","","","","","Landing statistics - Norwegian catches 1996-1999, Fiskets Gang, 1, (2000); Årsstatisfikk Desember 1999, Eksportutvalget for Fisk Desember, (1999); Saetre R., Miljørapport, Fisken og Havet, Sœrnummer 2, (1997); Bremner H.A., Paterson B.D., Goodrick B., Live transport of crabs and shrimp from Australia - Kuruma shrimp and spanner crabs as physiological case studies, Seafood from Producer to Consumer, pp. 71-85, (1997); Ban M., Ushio H., Yamanaka H., Postmortem biochemical changes in muscle of Buccinum striatissium during storage, Fisheries Sci, 64, pp. 482-486, (1998); Flick G.J., Lovell R.T., Post-mortem biochemical changes in the muscle of the Gulf shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, J Food Sci, 37, pp. 609-611, (1972); Matsumoto M., Yamanaka H., Studies on rigor-morris of kuruma prawn muscle, Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 57, pp. 2121-2126, (1991); Yamanaka H., Shimida R., Post-mortem biochemical changes in the muscle of the Japanese spiny lobster during storage, Fisheries Sci, 62, pp. 821-824, (1996); Lou S.N., Purine content in grass shrimp during storage as related to freshness, J Food Sci, 63, pp. 442-444, (1998); Lightner D.V., Normal post mortem changes in the brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, Fish Bull, 72, pp. 223-236, (1973); Baranowski E.S., Nip W.K., Moy J.H., Partial characterization of a crude enzyme extract from the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, J Food Sci, 49, pp. 1494-1495, (1984); Nip W.K., Lan C.Y., Moy J.H., Partial characterization of a collagenolytic enzyme fraction from the hepatopancreas of the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, J Food Sci, 50, pp. 1187-1188, (1985); Papadopoulos L.S., Smith S.B., Wheeler T.L., Finne G., Muscle ultrastructural changes in freshwater prawns, Macriobrachium rosenbergii during iced storage, J Food Sci, 54, pp. 1125-1128, (1989); Martinez I., Lauritzsen K., Effect of storage conditions on the protein content of the shrimp Pandalus borealis, Making the Most out of the Catch.

This is resulting in a growing demand for alternative approaches to designing and evaluating interventions in complex systems. Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach which may be useful because it enables stakeholders to present and test their theories and assumptions about why and how impact may occur, ideally within an environment conducive to iterative reflection and learning. However, ToC is yet to be appropriately mainstreamed into development by donors, researchers and practitioners. We carried out a literature review, triangulated by interviews with 26 experts in African and Asian food security, consisting of researchers, advisors to programs, and donors. Although 17 (65%) of the experts had adopted ToC, their responses and the literature revealed four challenges to mainstreaming: (i) different interpretations of ToC; (ii) incoherence in relationships among the constituent concepts of ToC; (iii) confused relationships between ToC and project “logframes”; and (iv) limitations in necessary skills and commitment for enacting ToC. A case study of the evolution of a ToC in a West African AR4D project over 4 years which exemplified these challenges is presented. Five recommendations arise to assist the mainstreaming of ToC: (i) select a type of ToC suited to the relative complexity of the problem and focal system of interest; (ii) state a theory or hypotheses to be tested as the intervention progresses; (iii) articulate the relationship between the ToC and parallel approaches (e.g. logframe); (iv) accept that a ToC is a process, and (v) allow time and resources for implementers and researchers to develop ToC thinking within projects. Finally, we suggest that communities of practice should be established among AR4D and donor organisations to test, evaluate and improve the contribution that ToCs can make to sustainable food security and agricultural development. © 2018","Africa; Aid effectiveness; Impact pathways; Logframe; Project/program design","West Africa; agricultural development; agricultural research; complexity; food science; food security; stakeholder","","","","","Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, (57685); West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development established six multi-country; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, DFA; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government, DFAT","Funding text 1: The research was conducted as part of CSIRO-BecA-CORAF/WECARD Africa Food Security Initiative funded by the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Funding Agreement No. 57685 ), as part of its overseas development assistance program.

One project was led by the Association for the Promotion of Livestock in the Sahel and Savannas (APESS), an internationally-funded association that works towards environmentally and economically sustainable animal husbandry and forage crop practices by traditional herders, and the greater involvement of animal producers in the economic, political and social development of West African countries. The project focused on development of opportunities for enhanced meat and milk output and profitability by animal producers in five countries in the Sahel ( Sparrow and Traoré, 2017, this special issue ), and the team consisted of agronomy and animal science researchers from universities and government agricultural research organisations in five countries. ; Funding text 3: The research was conducted as part of CSIRO-BecA-CORAF/WECARD Africa Food Security Initiative funded by the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Funding Agreement No. 57685), as part of its overseas development assistance program.

Many technologies have been established to analyze these molecules of interest in foods. However, the analysis of the spatial distribution of these compounds in foods using conventional technology, such as high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is difficult. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is considered an ideal complementary approach. MALDI-MSI is a two-dimensional MALDI-MS technology that can detect compounds in a tissue section without extraction, purification, separation, or labeling. MALDI-MSI can be used to visualize the spatial distribution of chemical compounds or biomolecules in foods. Although the methodology of MALDI-MSI in food science is not yet fully established, the versatility of MALDI-MSI is expected to open a new frontier in food science. Herein, we describe the principles and applications of MALDI-MSI in food science and related fields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on fish crude enzyme extract, in vitro digestibility of different fish materials processed under different conditions correlated positively with reactive SH content and content ratio of SH/S - S and negatively with D-Asp concentration. In vitro digestion of different experimental feeds, based on Atlantic salmon crude enzyme extracts, was studied in association with growth trials in order to investigate its value as a criterion for industrial strategy in predicting feed quality. Crude enzymes were extracted from the pyloric caeca before feeding. Significant differences in in vitro digestibility between the experimental feeds were observed whereby there would be differences in feed conversion efficiency within 3 months of feeding. There were associations between the in vitro digestibility and other parameters for dietary quality, such as mink digestibility and the biochemical structure parameters of the dietary protein due to different processing conditions. Crude enzyme extracts from rainbow trout and European seabass were also used for in vitro digestibility study of different experimental feeds by standardising trypsin activity to that of Atlantic salmon crude enzyme extract. The results indicated that different fish species have different digestion ability to the same feed types, and the effective time for feed utilisation and growth is dependent on fish sensitivity and the extent of difference in digestibility between the feeds consumed as observed in the Atlantic salmon trials. For the species investigated, sensitivity ranking of the enzymes to feed quality under the condition studied was Atlantic salmon > rainbow trout > European seabass. The results indicated that in vitro digestibility study of experimental feeds using pyloric caecal crude enzyme extract from a specific species at an age of interest could be a practical, quick and reliable method for testing feed quality in growth trials. By standardising the crude enzyme extract with regards to trypsin activity, the in vitro digestibility values could be comparable not only within the same species but also between different species. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Atlantic salmon; Chymotrypsin; D/L-aspartic acid; Disulphide bond; European seabass; Fish feed; Fish meal; In vitro digestibility; Mink; Rainbow trout; Sulphydryl group; Trypsin","Mustela vison; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmo salar; Salmonidae; food science","","","","","","","Ihekoronye A.I., Rapid in vitro enzymatic predictive model for the in vivo digestibility of food proteins, J Food Technol, 21, pp. 81-87, (1986); Dimes L.E., Haard N.F., Estimation of protein digestibility - I.

The traditional perception that legume flours are unsuitable for extrusion cooking is now proving to be outdated. Recent research suggests that legumes have great potential for replacing cereals in extruded snacks due to their healthier nutritional profile and remarkable functional characteristics. Scope and approach: In this paper, the scientific and technological challenges associated with incorporating legume-based flours into extruded cereal-based snacks are reviewed. After comparing the nutritional properties of cereals and legumes, technological properties of extrudates (i.e. expansion ratio, bulk density, sensory properties etc.) enriched with legumes are explored. The current market situation and the future of legume-based extruded snacks are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Due to their functional characteristics, legume flours demonstrate good potential in the manufacture of extruded healthier snacks in which cereal flours are partially or entirely substituted. Lab-scale extrusion trials produce a wealth of information affirming that incorporating legume flours significantly affects the final extrudate structure and subsequent quality/sensory attributes of snacks. However, more work needs to be carried out to identify the most appropriate combination of flours and to optimise processing conditions to improve sensory and quality attributes and promote consumer acceptance. Increasing application of legumes in extruded snacks will continue to drive the global legumes market. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cereals; Extrusion; Legume flours; Legumes; Snacks","Commerce; Extrusion; Nutrition; Cereal; Extrudates; Extruded snack food; Extruded snacks; Food science; Functional characteristics; Legume; Legume flour; Sensory attributes; Snack; Nitrogen fixation","","","","","","","Abebe W., Collar C., Ronda F., Impact of variety type and particle size distribution on starch enzymatic hydrolysis and functional properties of tef flours, Carbohydrate Polymers, 115, pp. 260-268, (2015); Adenekan M.K., Fadimu G.J., Oke E.K., Effect of isolation techniques on the characteristics of pigeon pea ( Cajanus cajan) protein isolates, Food Sciences and Nutrition, pp. 1-7, (2017); Ahmed S., Hasan M.M., Legumes: An overview, Journl of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2, 1, pp. 34-38, (2014); Ainsworth P., Extrusion, Food processing handbook, pp. 429-456, (2011); Ajita T., Extrusion cooking technology: An advance skill for manufacturing of extrudate food products.

Recent advances in techniques and hardware now allow the routine acquisition of high-resolution 13C NMR spectra from solid materials. Commercial hardware has been available for more than a decade and many applications to solids in a wide variety of areas have been described. Although 1H is the most abundant NMR nucleus in solid food materials, there are technical difficulties in high-resolution solid-state 1H NMR that make 13C the nucleus of choice. This article outlines some of the information of relevance to food science that has been obtained recently using 13C NMR. © 1992.","","Carbon; Chemical analysis; Hydrogen; Isotopes; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance; Food science; High resolution nuclear magnetic resonance; Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance; Food products","","","","","","","Harris, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: A Physicochemical View, (1983); Sanders, Hunter, Modern NMR Spectroscopy, (1987); Yannoni, Acc.

Aqueous extracts, essential oils, and dried parts of these plants have long been used in cosmetics, hygiene products, and traditional medicines. In addition, they are used as food additives due to their pleasant flavor and aroma, and their antibacterial, antifungal, insect repellent, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. With increasing concerns about loss of effectiveness and safety of commercial antibiotics, antifungals, insecticides, and preservatives, botanical products, including lavenders, are coming to the forefront. In this review, the current and potential applications of lavender essential oil in the food sciences are discussed. © 2016 by Elsevier, Inc..

For technological as well as structural reasons, university-industry collaborations are especially important in the case of the food industry. This paper aims at assessing the drivers of knowledge transfer from academic departments to industry. We analyse the dynamics of private funding of university research activities and investigate the drivers of university knowledge transfer from food science university departments, identifying how they differ from drivers in other areas of science. The empirical investigation is based on the econometric analysis of financial data on the whole population of university departments in Italy. We provide some implications for policy, highlighting whether and how university food science departments differ from university departments engaged in other areas of science, and how their interactions with industry can be increased. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Food science; Knowledge transfer; Research funding; University","Italy; academic research; econometrics; food industry; food science; knowledge; research work; university sector","","","","","Italian Ministry of University and Research; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","The empirical analysis is based on financial data from the whole population of university departments in Italy engaged in research in all nine Scientific Areas (SAs) of the Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS), which include Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Sciences (hereafter defined as food science departments). The data were provided by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR). We analyse financial data for the period 2008–2009, for 1136 departments from 59 public universities (4 of them polytechnic universities) located in 48 municipalities. The database provides information on amounts and sources of university funding, composition of staff, presence at the institution of an office to manage European patents and its main characteristics (i.e. management, incorporation with industry liaison office). These data were matched to research performance and industry indicators.  1. Research performance indicators are based on the evaluation of research output carried out over the period 2001–2003 by CIVR-VTR (MIUR, 2007). MIUR provide a composite indicator that takes account of peer review evaluations of research activity carried out at academic institutions (patents, impact factor of journal articles, etc.). 2. The statistical analysis takes account of indicators for the industry composition of the administrative province in which the academic institution is located. These data were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). reports the distribution of departments across the nine EPS SA considered here. Out of 1232 departments in Italy, there are 121 departments (10.3%) whose research activities are focused primarily on the area of food science.

We assess whether and to what extent food science departments differ from departments engaged in other hard sciences. presents information on the variables used in the regressions. Following the literature review above, we identify four types of determinants: Institutional characteristics; Intermediation in university–industry linkages; Research performance; Demand conditions.

A large proportion of population living in developing countries face daily food shortages as a result of environmental impacts or some other reasons like political instability, etc., while in the developed countries, food is surplus. For developing countries, the objective is to develop drought- and pest-resistant crops, with maximized yield. In developed countries, the food industry depends on consumer’s demand for fresher and healthier foodstuffs.

Broccoli production is generally concentrated in the summer/winter season, but the demand for a fresh product throughout the year requires production in other seasons. Sugars might affect flavour and the acceptance of broccoli by consumers. This study reports the free fructose, glucose and sucrose content in primary and secondary inflorescences of 11 cultivars of broccoli, one white cabbage and four Portuguese cabbages grown in early (March-July) and late (August-January) seasons in the northern region of Portugal. On average the results show that the total free sugar content in the broccoli cultivars, except for cv Marathon, is significantly (P < 0.05) lower than in the other cabbages. Fructose was the major sugar in the three types of Brassica, representing between 48.8 and 56.9% of the total sugar content in broccoli cvs Marathon and Senshi respectively and between 48.7% (cv Mirandela) and 53.8% (cv Murciana) in the other cabbages. Glucose was the second major sugar, while sucrose represented a maximum of 20.5% in broccoli cv Shogun and 11.1% in cv Murciana. The growing season influenced the free sugar content, with generally higher levels in the spring/summer than in the summer/winter season in broccoli, while an opposite tendency was noted in the other Brassica species. In broccoli the sugar levels in the primary inflorescences were generally lower than in the secondary inflorescences, except for sucrose. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Broccoli; Free sugars; Fructose; Glucose; Growing season; Portuguese cabbage; Sucrose; White cabbage","broccoli; cabbage; crop production; cultivar; fructose; glucose; growing season; inflorescence; nutritional quality; Portugal; secondary metabolite; sucrose; sugar; food science","","","","","","","Rosa E.A.S., Glucosinolates in cabbage.

The spoilage organism was extremely difficult to identify phenotypically and was poorly identified as Pasturella sp. (78.7% identification profile) employing the API 20NE identification scheme, which gave the profile 5040000. Molecular identification through PCR amplification of a partial region of the 16S rRNA gene followed by direct automated sequencing of the PCR amplicon allowed identification of the organism. Due to the sequence identity (100%) between the spoilage organism and a reference strain in GenBank, the spoilage isolate was considered to be an Asaia sp., a recently described genus and member of the acetic acid bacteria. This is the first report of Asaia sp. causing spoilage of a foodstuff and highlights the benefits of molecular identification techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequences in the identification of unusual spoilage organisms.","","Acetobacteraceae; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Beverages; DNA, Bacterial; Fruit; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Microbiology; Asaia; Asaia bogorensis; Asaia siamensis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Bacteria; Genes; RNA; ribosome DNA; ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; food science; microbiology; article; Asaia bogorensis; Asaia siamensis; bacterium isolation; controlled study; food spoilage; fruit; Gram negative bacterium; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; water contamination; Spoilage organism; Microbiology","GENBANK: AB025932, AF440747","DNA, Bacterial, ; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, ","","","","","Campbell P.W., Phillips J.A., Heidecker G.J., Krishnamani M.R., Zahorchak R., Stull T.L., Detection of Pseudomonas (Burkholderia) cepacia using PCR, Pediatr.

Box 5010, Norway","Rigor contraction and quality development were studied during storage of pre-rigor fillets of farmed Atlantic cod (body weight 2 kg). For eight weeks prior to slaughtering, the fish were fed diets containing either 100% fish oil (M-group) or 60% fish oil and 40% soybean oil (S-group). Filleting was performed 0.5 h after slaughtering and the fillets were stored at 6°C for 48 h post-mortem. The contraction rate was faster for the S-group, but after 48 h storage the contraction was 21% of the initial fillet length for both fish groups. The ATP content analysed 1 h post-mortem was lower of the S-group (4.5 μm g- 1 ww) compared with the M-group (6.1 μm g - 1 ww). After 16 h, the ATP content was similar for both fish groups (1.7-2.2 μm g- 1 ww). The muscle pH analysed 1 h post-mortem was 0.2 unit lower of the S-group (pH 6.9) than of the M-group (pH 7.1). From 8 to 12 h, the pH fell significantly to 6.3 and 6.6 for the S-group and M-group, respectively. From 24 h and onwards, the pH was similar of both fish groups (pH 6.2). Texture development differed significantly due to dietary treatment. The S-group had highest initial breaking force, demonstrating that the texture of this group was firmer immediately after slaughtering. The breaking force of the S-group dropped to a stable level after 4 h, whereas the breaking force of the M-group decreased continuously during the storage period. The breaking force was similar of both groups after 16 h storage. The L*-value (lightness) increased during the first 4-6 h storage. From 8 to 16 h, the L*-value was stable or slightly decreasing. The L*-value was consistently higher of the M-group. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of soybean oil resulted in faster energy depletion post-mortem, faster rigor contraction, faster reduction of the breaking strength and lower L*-values. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The extracts (at different concentrations) were tested for their anti-oxidation potential in a model meat system, based on mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM). The anti-oxidation characteristics were compared against a 1:1 butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA)/butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) mixture (200 mg/kg) and green tea extract (GT) (200 mg/kg). The MDCMs containing the various antioxidants were cooked, stored at 4°C and samples were analysed for their peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and hexanal generation. Although, the best antioxidation characteristics was shown by the BHA/BHT mix, the performance was closely matched by the natural polyphenols from GT and 800 mg/kg CL. At lower concentrations of 200 and 400 mg/kg, the antioxidation potential of CL extracts were about 50-80% of the BHA/BHT. © 2004 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.

Highly significant blood pressure effects were observed; i.e., milk fermented with the two strains of L. helveticus gave a more pronounced drop in blood pressure than the controls. Significant differences in heart rate effects were detected with one of the strains.","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Animals; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Catheterization; Disease Models, Animal; Fermentation; Heart Rate; Hypertension; Male; Milk; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus helveticus; Blood; Dairy products; Enzyme inhibition; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; bacterium; food science; animal experiment; animal model; article; cardiovascular effect; competitive inhibition; controlled study; fermented product; heart rate; Lactobacillus helveticus; mean arterial pressure; milk; nonhuman; rat; spontaneously hypertensive rat; Cardiovascular effects; Microorganisms","","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, ","","","","","Church F.C., Swaisgood H.E., Porter D.H., Catign G.L., Spectrophotometric assay using o-phthaldialdehyde for determination of proteolysis in milk and isolated milk proteins, J.

All animals were farm raised; eight were grazed on pasture and eight were fed a pelleted commercial feed mixture for 10 weeks prior to slaughter. The pellet-fed deer had a significantly higher dressing percentage than the pasture group. No differences were found in ultimate pH values and muscle glycogen content when comparing the treatment groups. Polar and neutral lipid fatty acid composition of the meat were analysed separately. Meat from pasture-fed deer showed a high content of the fatty acid 18:3 n-3 in the polar lipid fraction. In the same lipid fraction, the fatty acid 18:2 n-6 was dominant in meat from the pellet fed animals. Similar differences in the neutral lipid fraction were found when comparing fatty acid composition between treatment groups; however, the abundance of these fatty acids was much less. A trained expert panel using a descriptive test assessed the sensory profile of the meat. There was a significant difference between the two treatment groups for the sensory attribute of grassy flavour, with the pellet-fed animals having less grassy flavour than the animals grazing pasture. It was concluded that further research is needed to explore the effects of various feeding regimens applied to deer on parameters associated with meat lipids, including antioxidants and oxidation products. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Commercial feed; Farmed deer; Meat quality; Muscle glycogen; Natural pasture; Neutral lipids; Polar lipids; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; Sensory quality; Ultimate pH; Venison","Animalia; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus; Musculus; food science","","","","","","","Demeyer D., Lipid composition of beef in relation to feeding, nutrition and technology, Proc 45th International Congress of Meat Science and Technology, pp. 30-38, (1999); Rule D.C., Smith S.B., Romans J.R., Fatty acid composition of muscle and adipose tissue of meat animals, The Biology of Fat in Meat Animals Current Advances, pp. 144-165, (1995); Wood J.D., Enser M., Factors influencing fatty acids in meat and the role of antioxidants in improving meat quality, Br J Nutr, 78, (1997); Wachira A.M., Sinclair L.A., Wilkinson R.G., Demirel G., Enser M., Wood J.D., The effects of fat source and breed on the fatty acid composition of lamb muscle and adipose tissue, Proc British Society of Animal Science, (1999); Wiklund E., Pickova J., Sampels S., Lundstrom K., Fatty acid composition of M. longissimus lumborum, ultimate muscle pH values and carcass parameters in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L) grazed on natural pasture or fed a commercial feed mixture, Meat Sci, 58, pp. 293-298, (2001); Manley T.R., Forss D.A., Fatty acids of meat lipids from young red deer (Cervus elaphus), J Sci Food Agric, 30, pp. 927-931, (1979); Okuyama H., Ikemoto A., Needs to modify the fatty acid composition of meats for human health, Proc 45th International Congress of Meat Science and Technology, pp. 638-640, (1999); Young O., Priolo A., Pastoral and species flavour in lamb raised on pasture, lucerne or maize II: Sensory evaluation and odour volatiles, J Sci Food Agric, (2001); Hamilton W.J., Slaughter, venison and other products, Management and Diseases of Deer, pp. 17-23, (1994); Lowry O.H., Passoneau J.V., A Flexible System for Enzymatic, (1973); Folch J., Lees M., Sloane-Stanley G.H., A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues, J Biol Chem, 226, pp. 497-509, (1957); Hamilton J.G., Comal K., Rapid separation of neutral lipids, free fatty acids and polar lipids using prepacked silica Sep-Pak columns, Lipids, 23, pp. 1146-1149, (1988); Wiklund E., Nilsson A., Ahman B., Sensory meat quality, ultimate pH values, blood metabolites and carcass parameters in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L) fed various diets, Rangifer, 20, pp. 9-16, (2000); Sensory Analysis - Methodology - Flavour Profile Methods, (1985); Sensory Analysis - General Guidance for the Selection, Training and Monitoring of Assessors - Part 1: Selected Assessors, (1993); Genstat 5 Release 4.1 Reference Manual Supplement, (1998); Ahman B., Transfer of radiocaesium via reindeer meat to man - Effects of countermeasures applied in Sweden following the Chernobyl accident, J Environ Radioact, 46, pp. 113-120, (1999); Suttie J.M., Goodall E.D., Pennie K., Kay R.N.B., Winter feed restriction and summer compensation in red deer stags, Br J Nutr, 50, pp. 737-747, (1983); Drew K.R., Meat production from farmed deer, Biology of Deer Production, pp. 285-290, (1985); White R.G., Fancy S.G., Nutrition and energetics in indigenous northern ungulates, Proc NATO Advances Research Worhshop on Grazing Research in Northern Latitudes, Hvanneyri, pp. 259-269, (1986); Wiklund E., Hansson I., Malmfors G., Composition and quality of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L) carcasses, Proc 46th International Congress of Meat Science and Technology, (2000); Skjenneberg S., Jacobsen E., Movinkel H., pH-verden i reinkjøtt etter forskjellig behandling av dyrene for slakting, Nord Vet Med, 26, pp. 436-443, (1974); Wiklund E., Pre-slaughter Handling of Reindeer - Effects Meat Quality, (1996); Wiklund E., Andersson A., Malmfors G., Lundstrom K., Muscle glycogen levels and blood metabolites in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L) after transport and lairage, Meat Sci, 42, pp. 133-144, (1996); Nilsson A., Olsson I., Lingvall P., Evaluation of silage diets offered to reindeer calves intended for slaughter.

Browning development was followed by measuring absorbance at 420 nm (A420) and using CIE-Lab color system. Analysis of kinetic data from A420 values suggested a zero-order reaction for nonenzymatic browning, while changes in L* and b* parameters followed a first-order reaction. Activation energy for nonenzymatic browning determined by A420 values ranged from 17.60 to 35.27 kcal mol-1, while those for L* and b* parameters were 6.67-28.99 kcal mol-1 and 15.38-34.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. Activation energies were higher in orange (28.99-35.27 kcal mol-1) and tangerine (27.84-33.1 kcal mol-1) juice concentrates than those in grapefruit (6.74-27.81 kcal mol-1) and lemon (6.67-17.6 kcal mol-1) juice concentrates. The lower activation energies determined for grapefruit and lemon juice concentrates indicated that nonenzymatic browning reactions are favored in these samples.","Citrus juice concentrate; Color; Kinetic; Nonenzymatic browning; Storage","Citrus; Citrus limon; Citrus reticulata; Citrus x paradisi; Activation energy; Enzymes; Fruit juices; Fruits; First order reaction; Nonenzymatic browning; food science; Agriculture","","","","","","","Ashoor S.H., Zent J.B., Maillard browning of common aminoacids and sugars, J.

The influence of preparation conditions on composition and functional properties was investigated. Contents of 0.6% phytic acid and 2.3% pentosans were found for FI, whereas FM was almost phytic acid-free and had a low content of pentosans (0.6%). Chromatography and electrophoresis identified the 11S globulin (linin) as the main protein fraction in both isolates. Protein solubility, water- and oil-binding capacities, emulsification and theological properties of dispersions and gels were measured at pH 8 and 3. For the latter, interactions of protein with phytic acid and pentosans are highly probable. FI possesses a lower solubility (about 40-50%) and an overall higher water-binding capacity than FM. For FI dispersions a higher storage modulus G′ than loss modulus G″ was measured, clearly pointing to the formation of protein networks. Moreover, FI formed stronger gels than FM (G′ about fivefold). The emulsifying activity, however, was distinctly lower for FI. These results point to enhanced complexation and aggregation of the isoelectric-precipitated protein isolate. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Composition; Extraction condition; Flaxseed; Functional properties; Protein isolate","Linum; Linum usitatissimum; food science; protein; seed","","","","","","","Caragay A.B., Cancer preventive foods and ingredients, Food Technol, 46, pp. 65-68, (1992); Harris R.K., Haggerty W.J., Assays for potentially anticarcinogenic phytochemicals in flaxseed, Cereal Foods World, 38, pp. 147-151, (1993); Batthy R.S., Nutrient composition of whole flaxseed and flaxseed meal, in Flaxseed in Human Nutrition, pp. 22-42, (1995); Oomah B.D., Mazza G., Flaxseed proteins - A review, Food Chem, 48, pp. 109-114, (1993); Oomah B.D., Mazza G., Functional properties, uses of flaxseed protein, INFORM, 6, pp. 1246-1252, (1995); Dev D.K., Quensel E., Preparation and functional properties of linseed protein products containing differing levels of mucilage, J Food Sci, 53, pp. 1834-1837, (1988); Dev D.K., Quensel E., Functional properties of linseed protein products containing different levels of mucilage in selected food systems, J Food Sci, 54, pp. 183-186, (1989); Dev D.K., Quensel E., Functional and microstructural characteristics of linseed (Linum usitatissimum L) flour and a protein isolate, Lebensm Wiss Technnol, 19, pp. 331-337, (1986); Oomah B.D., Mazza G., Processing of flaxseed meal: Effect of solvent extraction on physicochemical characteristics, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 26, pp. 312-317, (1993); Oomah B.D., Mazza G., Cui W., Optimization of protein extraction from flaxseed meal, Food Res Int, 27, pp. 355-361, (1994); Cui W., Mazza G., Oomah B.D., Optimization of an aqueous extraction process for flaxseed gum by response surface methodology, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 27, pp. 363-369, (1994); Madhusudhan K.T., Singh N., Studies on linseed proteins, J Agric Food Chem, 31, pp. 959-963, (1983); Wanasundara J.P.D., Shahidi F., Alkanol-ammonia-water/hexane extraction of flaxseed, Food Chem, 49, pp. 39-44, (1994); Ismond M.A.H., Welsh W.D., Application of new methodology to canola protein isolation, Food Chem, 45, pp. 125-127, (1992); Itzhaki R.F., Gill D.M., A micro biuret method for estimating proteins, Anal Biochem, 9, pp. 401-410, (1961); Rounds M.A., Nielsen S.S., Anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography with post-column detection for the analysis of phytic acid and other inositol phosphates, J Chromatogr A, 653, pp. 148-152, (1993); Hashimoto S., Shogren M.D., Pomeranz Y., Cereal pentosans: Their estimation and significance.

Protein-templated gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) is a kind of fluorescent nanomaterials with good solubility, excellent stability, biocompatibility, decent quantum yields and active groups (–COOH, –NH2) for facilitating modifications. Natural proteins are easily available, commercially affordable, diverse and multitudinous in animals, plants and foods, which provide a template pool for the exploration of AuNCs. This is one of the few reviews of specifically focusing on the natural protein-templated fluorescent AuNCs. The syntheses, properties and applications of different AuNCs were enumerated. Prospects were given on utilizing structure-modified proteins, bioactive enzymes, antibodies which should endow the AuNCs more favourable fluorescence performances and functional characteristics. The applications of AuNCs in analytical, biomedical and food sciences would be further heightened. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fluorescence; Gold nanoclusters; Nanomaterial; Natural protein","Amino Acids; Animals;

Box 7051, Sweden","Folate-binding protein (FBP) was discovered in cow's milk around 40 years ago. Bovine FBP belongs to a family of several folate-binding proteins. In milk, it is a soluble whey protein with the ability to sequester folate from blood plasma. Bovine FBP is a well-characterized protein in terms of amino acid sequence and binding characteristics. Affinity and binding kinetics towards various folate forms have been intensively studied because they are crucial in using bovine FBP as an analytical tool. Shortly after the identification of bovine FBP, a competitive protein-binding assay for measuring serum and blood folate concentrations was introduced. Another analytical application of bovine FBP is in affinity chromatography, as a clean-up/concentration step for analysis of folates in foods and biological samples by liquid chromatographic methods. Concentrations of FBP in milk and dairy products have been determined by ELISA and Surface Plasmon Resonance-biosensor techniques. Since the initial reports of FBP in cow's milk, its physiological role has been discussed, especially regarding its effects on folate absorption from milk and dairy products. This review summarizes recent biochemical, analytical, food science, and nutritional advances regarding folate-binding protein in milk. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","binding kinetics; Bovine FBP; folate absorption","Animals; Cattle; Female; Folate Receptor 1; Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored; Folic Acid; Humans; Intestinal Absorption; Male; Milk; Solubility; Bovinae; Affinity chromatography; Amino acids; Biosensors; Chromatographic analysis; Dairy products; Liquid chromatography; Mammals; Physiology; folate receptor; folate receptor 1; folic acid; Amino acid sequence; Analytical applications; Analytical method; Analytical tool; Binding characteristics; Binding kinetics; Biological samples; Blood plasma; Bovine FBP; Chromatographic methods; Folate-binding protein; Folates; Food science; Protein-binding; Surface plasmons; Whey proteins; animal; cattle; chemistry; female; genetics; human; intestine absorption; male; metabolism; milk; review; solubility; Proteins","","folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; Folate Receptor 1, ; Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored, ; Folic Acid, 59-30-3","","","","","Achanta K., Boeneke C.A., Aryana K.J., Characteristics of reduced fat milks as influenced by the incorporation of folic acid, J.

Firstly, we present the state of the art in dynamic modelling and model-based design, optimisation and control of food systems. The need for nonlinear, dynamic, multi-physics and multi-scale representations of food systems is established. Current difficulties in building such models are reviewed: incomplete, piecewise available knowledge, spread out among different disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology and consumer science) and contributors (scientists, experts, process operators, process managers), scarcity, uncertainty and high cost of measured data, complexity of phenomena and intricacy of time and space scales. Secondly, we concentrate on the opportunities offered by the complex systems science to cope with the difficulties faced by food science and engineering. Newly developed techniques such as model-based viability analysis, optimisation, dynamic Bayesian networks etc. are shown to be relevant and promising for design and optimisation of foods and food processes based on consumer needs and expectations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","","Bayesian networks;

How growing conditions affect levels of carotenoids in pepper fruits as they mature is not well known. Five cvs of bell pepper (Bell Captain, Melody, North Star, Ranger, Red Beauty) and five cvs of pungent-type peppers (Anaheim, Ancho, Cayenne, Pimento, Red Cherry) were grown in a glasshouse and in the field. Fruits were harvested at the green, turning (50% green) and mature red stages and analysed for levels of the carotenoids β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, capsanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin and totals of these carotenoids. Levels of provitamin A: retinol equivalents (RE) were derived from levels of β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene and β-carotene. Levels of most carotenoids and RE were significantly higher in glasshouse-grown plants, and most were higher in fruits at the red stage. Fruits of Ancho type had the most β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, β-carotene, total carotenoids and RE, while fruits of Red Cherry type had the most capsanthin and zeaxanthin, and fruits of Bell Captain had the most lutein. Interactions of the main effects variables, ie location of production (field vs glasshouse), stage of development and cultivar, indicated differences in patterns of carotenoid levels and RE. The data indicated that growing conditions influenced carotenoid levels. The more consistent and protected conditions in the glasshouse may have caused carotenoid levels to be increased, especially at the red stage.","α-carotene; β-carotene; β-cryptoxanthin; Capsanthin; Capsicum; Lutein; Physiology; Retinol equivalents; Zeaxanthin","Capsicum; Capsicum annuum var. annuum; carotenoid; food science","","","","","","","Lampe J.W., Health effects of vegetables and fruit: Assessing mechanisms of action in human experimental studies, Am J Clin Nutr, 70, (1999); Bradley S., Shinton R., Why is there an association between eating fruit and vegetables and a lower risk of stroke?, J Human Nutr Diet, 11, pp. 363-372, (1998); Feskanich D., Zicgler R.G., Michaud D.S., Giovannucci E.L., Speizer F.E., Willett W.C., Colditz G.A., Prospective study of fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of lung cancer among men and women, J Natl Cancer Inst, 92, pp. 1812-1823, (2000); Khachik F., Beecher G.R., Smith J.C.

The formation of protein aggregates (PAs) is influenced by various factors, and aggregates with different sizes and shapes play an important role in food systems. Although there have been many reports on food PAs, many challenges still need to be addressed, and a systematic literature review is lacking. Thus, hypotheses about the PAs formation mechanism were summarized, and the fibrosis aggregates formation mechanism was described. The main findings of this paper indicate that the forces driving protein aggregation are covalent and non-covalent cross-linking interactions. The determination of PAs is mainly based on protein particle size combined with multispectral methods. PAs are not only associated with protein functional properties (such as emulsion and gel) but also related to harmful substances (such as advanced glycation end products, AGEs) formation. Finally, the applications of PAs in food science were summarized. Outlook and challenges were described from the perspectives of food processing conditions and parameters, food components and their interactions, food nutrition and health relationships, etc. This review will attract more food scientists to participate in related research on protein aggregation in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Application; Evaluation method; Formation mechanism; Influence factor; Protein aggregates","Aggregates; Emulsification; Particle size; Proteins; Aggregate formation; Aggregation applications; Evaluation methods; Food proteins; Food science; Formation mechanism; Influence factor; ITS applications; Protein aggregates; Protein aggregation; Food processing","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC; Agriculture Research System of China, (CARS-41-Z); Agriculture Research System of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFD2100104); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study was supported by National Key R & D Program of China (2021YFD2100104) and Agriculture Research System of China (CARS-41-Z).

They can also be used as starting matrices to produce biologically active metabolites of interests. Though numerous chemical synthesis routes have been proposed and deployed for the synthesis of rare sugars, however, many of them are limited and economically incompetent because of expensive raw starting feedstocks. Whereas, the biosynthesis by enzymatic means are often associated with high catalyst costs and low space-time yields. Microbial production of rare sugars via green routes using bio-renewable resources offers noteworthy solutions to overcome the aforementioned limitations of synthetic and enzymatic synthesis routes. From the microbial-based synthesis perspective, the lipogenic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is rapidly evolving as the most prevalent and unique “non-model organism” in the bio-production arena. Due to high flux tendency through the tri-carboxylic acid cycle intermediates and precursors such as acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, this yeast has been widely investigated to meet the increasing demand of industrially relevant fine chemicals, including functional sugars. Incredible interest in Y. lipolytica originates from its robust tolerance to unstable pH, salt levels, and organic compounds, which subsequently enable easy bioprocess optimization. Meaningfully, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status creates Y. lipolytica as an attractive and environmentally friendly microbial host for the manufacturing of nutraceuticals, fermented food, and dietary supplements. In this review, we highlight the recent and state-of-the-art research progress on Y. lipolytica as a host to synthesize bio-based compounds of interest beyond the realm of well-known fatty acid production. The unique physicochemical properties, biotechnological applications, and biosynthesis of an array of value-added functional sugars including erythritol, threitol, fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, isomalto-oligosaccharides, isomaltulose, trehalose, erythrulose, xylitol, and mannitol using sustainable carbon sources are thoroughly vetted. Finally, we conclude with perspectives that would be helpful to engineer Y. lipolytica in greening the twenty-first century biomedical and biotechnological sectors of the modern world. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biocatalysis; biotransformation; functional sugars; industrial biotechnology; metabolic engineering; Yarrowia lipolytica","Biotechnology; Fatty Acids; Metabolic Engineering; Sugars; Yarrowia; Biochemistry; Bioconversion; Biosynthesis; Fatty acids; Food additives; Metabolism; Metabolites; Physicochemical properties; Sugar substitutes; Sugars; Yeast; carbohydrate; fatty acid; Biocatalysis; Biotransformation; Critical review; Food science; Functional sugar; Industrial biotechnology; Rare sugars; Synthesis route; Y. lipolytica; Yarrowia lipolytica; biotechnology; genetics; metabolic engineering; Yarrowia; Metabolic engineering","","Fatty Acids, ; Sugars, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21877078); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0900700)","The National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0900700] and The National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 21877078] financially supported this work.","Aditiya H.B., Mahlia T.M.I., Chong W.T., Nur H., Sebayang A.H., Second generation bioethanol production: A critical review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 66, pp. 631-653, (2016); Albayrak N., Yang S.T., Production of galacto-oligosaccharides from lactose by Aspergillus oryzae β-galactosidase immobilized in cotton cloth, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 77, 1, pp. 8-19, (2002); An J., Zhang L., Li L., Liu D., Cheng H., Wang H., Nawaz M.Z., Cheng H., Deng Z., An alternative approach to synthesizing galactooligosaccharides by cell-surface display of β-galactosidase on Yarrowia lipolytica, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 64, 19, pp. 3819-3827, (2016); Andreishcheva E.N., Isakova E.P., Sidorov N.N., Abramova N.B., Ushakova N.A., Shaposhnikov G.L., Soares M.I.M., Zvyagilskaya R.A., Adaptation to salt stress in a salt-tolerant strain of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, Biochemistry.

The Se level ranged from 0.015 to 0.046 μg g-1. Considering the average daily individual consumption of rice products in Southern China, the average dietary intake of Se supplied by this source is only 6-18 μgday-1 for an adult. This low Se intake from rice products is mainly responsible for the low total Se intake of inhabitants in Southern China. Foliar spraying of Se-enriched fertiliser or sodium selenite with 14-18 g Se ha-1 in the heading stage of rice growth increased the Se content to 0.178-0.421 μg g-1 in rice products. The concentration and amount of Se-enriched fertiliser can be varied to achieve an optimum concentration of Se in rice products. The authors suggest that these Se-enriched rice products can contribute an increase in Se intake of 50-100 μgday-1 on average if their Se concentration is controlled in the region of 0.15-0.50 μg g-1. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Production of Se-enriched rice; Rice; Se-enriched fertiliser; Selenium","China; fertilizer; food science; rice; selenium; spectrophotometry","","","","","","","Gupta U.C., Gupta S.C., Selenium in soils and crops, its deficiencies in livestock and humans, implications for management, Commun Soil Sci Plant Anal, 31, pp. 1791-1807, (2000); Reilly C., Selenium: A new entrant into the functional food arena, Trends Food Sci Technol, 9, pp. 114-118, (1998); Foster L.H., Sumar S., Selenium in health and disease, a review, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 37, pp. 211-228, (1997); Ge K., Yang G., The epidemiology of selenium deficiency in the etiology of endemic diseases in China, Am J Clin Nutr, 57, pp. 259-263, (1993); Gladyshev V.N., Martin R., Francisco J., Xu X.M., Molecular biology of selenium and its role in cancer, AIDS and other human diseases, Recent Res Develop Biochem, 1, pp. 145-167, (1999); Aoseer B., Zhang D.W., Liu L., Regional environmental differentiation and regional safety threshold of soil selenium, Acta Pedol Sinica, 32, pp. 189-193, (1995); Chen L.C., Hu Q.H., Determination of selenium levels in major foodstuff for evaluation of selenium nutrition status of residents in Nanjing, Food Sci, 21, pp. 56-58, (2000); Salonen J.T., Alfthan G., Pikkarainen J., Huttunen J.K., Puska P., Association between cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction and serum selenium in a matched pair longitudinal study, Lancet, 2, 24 JULY, pp. 175-179, (1982); Clement I.P., Birringer M., Block E., Kotrebai M., Julian F.T., Peter C.U., Donald J.L., Chemical speciation influences comparative activity of selenium-enriched garlic and yeast in mammary cancer, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 2062-2070, (2000); John W.F., Clement I.P., Donald J.L., Cindy D.D., Korry J.H., Whanger P.D., Cancer-protective properties of high-selenium broccoli, J Agric Food Chem, 49, pp. 2679-22683, (2001); Food additives permitted in feed and drinking water of animals.

In particular, information on water compartments, diffusion and movement can be obtained by detecting proton signals prevalently ascribable to H2O contained in foodstuffs. The main advantage of this technique is that it does not require any pretreatment of the sample and once developed, standard protocols based on rapid measurements can be easily transferred to quality control applications. An actual breakthrough for the low-field NMR application to food science has certainly been the development of unilateral NMR sensors. These devices present an attractive option for non-invasive assessment of compositional and microstructure of food materials. They are portable and allow easy sample access, which makes them attractive for quality control in industrial environments and directly on sealed packaged foods. A price to pay is the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field, which compromises the sensitivity of these devices. However, recent developments in unilateral magnets design offer larger sensitive volume, higher sensitivity and shorter dead times. In this brief review, we highlight the different uses of unilateral NMR devices in food analysis. © 2017, The Author(s).","Food science; Portable NMR; Quality control process; Relaxation times; Self-diffusion coefficient;

Lettuce is also a significant source of natural phytochemicals. These compounds, including glycosylated flavonoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, the vitamin B groups, ascorbic acid, tocopherols, and sesquiterpene lactones, are essential nutritional bioactive compounds. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the composition of health-promoting compounds in different types of lettuce, the potential health benefits of lettuce in reducing the risks of chronic diseases, and the effect of preharvest and postharvest practices on the biosynthesis and accumulation of health-promoting compounds in lettuce. © 2021 The Authors.

The use of ML models for the monitoring and prediction of food safety is growing in recent years. Currently, several studies have reviewed ML applications on foodborne disease and deep learning applications on food. This article presents a literature review on ML applications for monitoring and predicting food safety. The paper summarizes and categorizes ML applications in this domain, categorizes and discusses data types used for ML modeling, and provides suggestions for data sources and input variables for future ML applications. The review is based on three scientific literature databases: Scopus, CAB Abstracts, and IEEE. It includes studies that were published in English in the period from January 1, 2011 to April 1, 2021. Results show that most studies applied Bayesian networks, Neural networks, or Support vector machines. Of the various ML models reviewed, all relevant studies showed high prediction accuracy by the validation process.

Any possible synergistic effect of their joint use was also investigated. The experimental data concerning colour loss, as determined by the ASTA 20.1 method, fitted first- and second-order kinetics, which provided the rate constants of colour loss and half-lives of the samples. The first finding concerned the antagonistic effect between storage temperature and humidity. The antioxidants had a clear protective effect on colour stability in all the conditions assayed, the superior effect of one or the other depending on the storage temperature.

Peeled and sliced tubers were boiled, while intact potatoes were baked in their skins. Flavour components from the boiled slices and the flesh of the baked tubers were isolated by headspace adsorption onto Tenax and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For all cooking procedures, Estima gave stronger isolates than Maris Piper. The two main sources of flavour compounds (regardless of cooking procedure) were lipid degradation and the Maillard reaction and/or sugar degradation. The ratio (yield derived from lipid)/(yield derived from Maillard reaction and/or sugar) decreased from 8.5-9.1 (boiling) to 2.7-3.4 (microwave baking) and to 0.4-1.1 (conventional baking). Quantitative and qualitative differences among the cooking procedures are explained in terms of the variations in heat and mass transfer processes that occurred. Each cooking procedure resulted in a unique profile of flavour compounds. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Aroma; Boiled potato; Conventionally baked potato; Flavour; Microwave-baked potato; Potato","Piperaceae; Solanum tuberosum; food science","","","","","","","Whitfield F.B., Last J.H., Tuber vegetables, Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages, pp. 222-231, (1991); Maga J.A., Potato flavor, Food Rev Int, 10, pp. 1-48, (1994); Nijssen L.M., Visscher C.A., Maarse H., Willemsens L.C., Boelens M.H., Volatile Compounds in Food.

Available lysine and FUR contents were determined by fluorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between adapted and follow-up infant formulas with respect to the available lysine and FUR contents. Available lysine contents decreased significantly throughout the storage time, and the contents at 37°C were lower than at 20°C. A statistically significant increase in FUR contents was observed during the storage period, with the contents being high at 37°C than at 20°C. A simple regression analysis between the available lysine and FUR contents during (a) the first year (b) the second year and (c) the two storage years was applied. The best correlations were obtained during the first year of storage.

The study was conducted with a total of 550 consumers in four cities: Alicante (Spain), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Manhattan (U.S.A.) and 9 de Julio (Argentina). The products were reconstituted powdered juices with the following flavors: apple, cherry, grape, grapefruit, orange and pear. Overall, FSRC consumers had the lowest acceptability scores for these products. Regarding CATA results, multiple correspondence analysis showed cherry and grape juices were associated to artificial-flavor and artificial-color, with the FSRC respondents being mainly responsible for the use of these descriptors. Pear and orange were considered to have natural-flavor and good-color, mainly by children and women. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the effect of ""sample,"" ""city"" and ""consumer segment"" on the percentage of checks given to each descriptor. The ""consumer segment"" effect was significant for nearly all descriptors, with FSRC checking samples differently to women and children. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..","","Citrus x paradisi; Malus x domestica; Pyrus; Vitaceae; Fruit juices; Artificial color; Buenos Aires; Consumer segments; Food science; Generalized linear model; Grape juice; Multiple correspondence analysis; Sensory acceptabilities; Citrus fruits","","","","","","","Araneda M., Hough G., Wittig De Penna E., Current-status survival analysis methodology applied to estimating sensory shelf life of ready-to-eat lettuce (lactuta sativa), J.

The enzyme could be identified in partially purified protein preparations by direct photolabeling with [methyl-3H]SAM, and this reaction was prevented by previous incubation with S-adenosylhomocysteine. Gel filtration indicated that the Mr was 112,000, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme was composed of two subunits with molecular weights of approximately 52,500. The enzyme had a pH optimum between 8.2 and 8.5 and an optimum temperature of 28°C, with a pI of 4.9. The Km values for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and SAM were 135.9 ± 12.8 and 284.1 ± 35.1 μM, respectively. S-Adenosylhomocysteine acted as a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of 378.9 ± 45.4 μM. The methyltransferase was also strongly inhibited by low concentrations of several metal ions, such as Cu2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, and Ag+, and to a lesser extent by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, but it was not significantly affected by several thiols or other thiol reagents. The methyltransferase was specifically induced by several chlorophenols, especially if they contained three or more chlorine atoms in their structures. Substrate specificity studies showed that the activity was also specific for halogenated phenols containing fluoro, chloro, or bromo substituents, whereas other hydroxylated compounds, such as hydroxylated benzoic acids, hydroxybenzaldehydes, phenol, 2-metoxyphenol, and dihydroxybenzene, were not methylated.","","Anisoles; Chlorobenzenes; Chlorophenols; Enzyme Induction; Food Handling; Kinetics; Methyltransferases; Molecular Weight; Protein Subunits; Substrate Specificity; Thermodynamics; Trichoderma; Wine; Trichoderma; Trichoderma longibrachiatum; Enzyme inhibition; Phenols; Positive ions; Purification; 4 chloromercuribenzoic acid; anisole derivative; chloroanisole; chlorophenol; chlorophenol 2 methyltransferase; copper ion; halophenol; mercury; methyltransferase; s adenosylhomocysteine; s adenosylmethionine; silver; unclassified drug; zinc ion; food science; microbiology; article; competitive inhibition; enzyme induction; enzyme inhibition; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; food contamination; gel filtration; methylation; nonhuman; pH; photoaffinity labeling; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; temperature; Trichoderma; trichoderma longibrachiatum; wine; Methylation; Microbiology","","4 chloromercuribenzoic acid, 59-85-8; chlorophenol, 25167-80-0; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; methyltransferase, 9033-25-4; s adenosylhomocysteine, 979-92-0; s adenosylmethionine, 29908-03-0, 485-80-3; silver, 7440-22-4; zinc ion, 23713-49-7; Anisoles, ; Chlorobenzenes, ; Chlorophenols, ; Methyltransferases, EC 2.1.1.-; Protein Subunits, ; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:trichlorophenol O-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.136","","","","","Alvarez-Rodriguez M.L., Lopez-Ocana L., Lopez-Coronado J.M., Rodriguez E., Martinez M.J., Larriba G., Coque J.J.R., Cork taint of wines: Role of the filamentous fungi isolated from cork in the formation of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole by O methylation of 2, 4,6-trichlorophenol, Appl.

With special confined aqueous cores, RMs have emerged as a useful technique with a variety of applications in food science; however still lacking a comprehensive review in the subject area. This paper aims to critically review the research on the applications of RMs in food science, which allow us to better understand its current status, limits and potential. Scope and approach: The current applications of RMs in food science were reviewed, including food protein extraction, simultaneous extraction of oils and proteins, utilization and development of effective antioxidants, separation and purification of enzymes, fabrication of enzyme-immobilized magnetic nanoparticles, and enrichment of food-derived components for analysis and quantification. The challenges and future perspectives were further discussed. Key findings and conclusions: The major applications of RMs in food science are extraction and purification of proteins and enzymes. The solutions to overcome the challenges were proposed, such as construction of effective RMs system by more biocompatible surfactants and apolar solvents, implementing continuous extraction, and complete removal of residual surfactants from the end products. Future research on expanding the application areas was directed, for instance, as a separation method to fractionate bioactive molecules, as a model system to explore the behaviors of bioactive molecules at cellular level and further illustrate the bioactive mechanism, and as potential nanocarriers for delivering food-derived bioactive compounds. Overall, RMs technique shows promises as a powerful strategy in food science. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Application; Aqueous core; Food science; Reverse micelle; Surfactant","Applications; Biocompatibility; Enzymes; Extraction; Micelles; Molecules; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Purification; Surface active agents; Aqueous core; Biocompatible surfactants; Extraction and purifications; Food science; Magnetic nano-particles; Reverse micelles; Separation and purification; Simultaneous extractions; Oils and fats","","","","","Foundation for the Characteristic Discipline of Processing Technology of Plant Foods, (LTSW201720, YSTSXK201811); Department of Education, Heilongjiang Province, (135309113); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, (LC2018014); University Nursing Program for Young Scholar with Creative Talents in Heilongjiang Province, (UNPYSCT-2018105)","This work was supported by grants from Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (Grant number: LC2018014 ); Foundation for the Characteristic Discipline of Processing Technology of Plant Foods (Grant numbers: YSTSXK201811 and LTSW201720 ); Creative Talents Training Program of Heilongjiang Province (Grant number: UNPYSCT-2018105 ) and Scientific Research Innovation Team Project from Education Department of Heilongjiang Province (Grant number: 135309113 ) to X.

There are good reasons to suspect some genetic influence on food acceptance, not least because genetic factors are implicated in a number of factors that are likely to be related to food choice. In addition, some food dislikes show themselves early in life, before there is any evidence for aversive experiences. Although taste has been widely studied in regards of pure tastes such as bitter or sweet perception, the relationship between taste-related genes and food preferences has seldom been explored. In this work we investigated relationship of 37 taste-related genes with food preferences. The study was carried out during a scientific expedition through Caucasus and Central Asia (Silk Road) analyzing more than 400 samples from 5 different countries. A food preference questionnaire was administered to each participant and a DNA sample was obtained. Other information, such as age, sex, life style and anthropometrical measures, were also collected. We found significant associations with variants of: (1) TAS1R2 [Correction added after initial online publication on 27 Aug 2012. TAS1R3 was changed to TAS1R2.] gene and liking of Vodka (P= 1.6 × 10-3), white wine (P= 4.0 × 10-4) and lamb meat (P= 1.6 × 10-3); (2) PCLB2 gene and preference for Hot Tea (P= 8.0 × 10-4); (3) TPRV1 gene and beet liking (P= 3.8 × 10-5); and (4) ITPR3 gene and liking of both lamb meat (5.8 × 10-4) and sheep cheese (8.9×10-4). These findings give a new insight on a better understanding, of genetic factors influencing food preferences which is critical to the development of effective dietary interventions, especially for people that may be genetically not predisposed for liking specific nutrients. © 2012 Institute of Food Technologists®.","Acceptability; Food science; Genotype; Sensory evaluation","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Azerbaijan; Child; Choice Behavior; Cohort Studies; Female; Food Habits; Food Preferences; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Georgia; Humans; Kazakhstan; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Questionnaires; Tajikistan; Taste; Uzbekistan; Young Adult; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Ovis aries; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Azerbaijan; child; cohort analysis; decision making; feeding behavior; female; food preference; gene frequency; genetics; genotype; human; Kazakhstan; male; middle aged; quantitative trait locus; questionnaire; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; Tajikistan; taste; United States; Uzbekistan; very elderly","","","","","","","Aulchenko Y.S., Ripke S., Isaacs A., van Duijn C.M., GenABEL: an R package for genome-wide association analysis, Bioinformatics, 23, 10, pp. 1294-1296, (2007); Bachmanov A.A., Kiefer S.W., Molina J.C., Tordoff M.G., Duffy V.B., Bartoshuk L.M., Mennella J.A., Chemosensory factors influencing alcohol perception, preferences, and consumption, Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 27, pp. 220-231, (2003); Birch L.L., The relationship between children's food preferences and those of their parents, J Nutr Educ, 12, pp. 14-18, (1980); Blednov Y.A., Walker D., Martinez M., Levine M., Damak S., Margolskee R.F., Perception of sweet taste is important for voluntary alcohol consumption in mice, Genes Brain Behav, 7, pp. 1-13, (2008); Brasser S.M., Norman M.B., Lemon C.H., T1r3 taste receptor involvement in gustatory neural responses to ethanol and oral ethanol preference, Physiol Genomics, 41, 3, pp. 232-243, (2010); Breen F.M., Plomin R., Wardle J., Heritability of food preferences in young children, Physiol Behav, 88, 4-5, pp. 443-447, (2006); Chen W.M., Abecasis G.R., Family-based association tests for genome-wide association scans, Am J Hum Genet, 81, 5, pp. 913-926, (2007); Cortright D.N., Szallasi A., Biochemical pharmacology of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1.

Results demonstrated that the addition of ground peppers (both sweet and hot) to beef patties delayed and inhibited very significantly (p <0.05) the oxidation of both myoglobin and lipid as well as the growth of psychrotrophic bacteria. As a consequence, and according to instrumental and sensory results of meat colour and odour, the shelf life of beef patties was extended from about 4 to about 16 days. Capsaicinoid-rich cayenne hot pepper exerted a more intense antioxidative effect than capsaicinoid-free red sweet pepper. The addition of lycopene-enriched tomato products (LOM and LRTP) was not as effective as treatment with peppers, although they exerted a significant (p <0.05) antioxidative effect too, depending on the lycopene concentration. These tomato products delayed meat deterioration to a varying extent, so that the shelf life of treated beef patties ranged between 8 and 12 days. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Beef patties; Cayenne; Colour; Lipid oxidation; Lycopene; Meat; Natural antioxidants; Pepper; Tomato","Caesalpinia ciliata; Capsicum; Capsicum annuum var. annuum; Capsicum frutescens; Lycopersicon esculentum; food science","","","","","","","Renerre M., Biochemical basis of fresh meat colour, Proc 45th ICoMST, pp. 344-353, (1999); Sanchez-Escalante A., Djenane D., Torrescano G., Beltran J.A., Roncales P., The effects of ascorbic acid, taurine, carnosine and rosemary powder on colour and lipid stability of beef patties packaged in modified atmosphere, Meat Sci, 58, pp. 421-429, (2001); Djenane D., Sanchez-Escalante A., Torrescano G., Beltran J.A., Roncales P., Extension of the retail display life of fresh beef packaged in modified atmosphere by varying lighting conditions, J Food Sci, 66, pp. 181-186, (2001); Ho C.P., McMillin K.W., Huang N.Y., Ground beef lipid, color, and microsomal stability in gas exchange modified atmosphere packaging, Proc IFT Ann Meet, (1996); Faustman C., Cassens R.G., The biochemical basis for discoloration in meat: A review, J Muscle Foods, 1, pp. 217-243, (1990); Barbut S., Josephson D.B., Maurer A.J., Antioxidant properties of rosemary oleoresin in turkey sausage, J Food Sci, 50, pp. 1356-1359, (1985); Stoick S.M., Gray J.I., Booren A.M., Buckley D.J., The oxidative stability of restructured beef steaks processed with ah oleoresin rosemary, tertiary butylhydroquinone, and sodium tripolyphosphate, J Food Sci, 56, pp. 597-600, (1991); El-Alim S.S.L.A., Lugasi A., Hovari J., Dworschak E., Culinary herbs inhibit lipid oxidation in raw and cooked minced meat patties during storage, J Sci Food Agric, 79, pp. 277-285, (1999); Sarraga C., Carreras I., Guardia M.D., Guerrero L., Utilización del licopeno como antioxidante añadido a la dieta de pollos, Eurocarne, 98, pp. 67-72, (2001); Fuhrman B., Volkova N., Rosenblat M., Aviram M., Lycopene synergistically inhibits LDL oxidation in combination with vitamin E, glabridin, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, or garlic, Antioxid Redox Signal, 2, pp. 491-506, (2000); Gnayfeed M.H., Daood H.G., Biacs P.A., Alcaraz C.F., Content of bioactive compounds in pungent spice red pepper (paprika) as affected by ripening and genotype, J Sci Food Agric, 81, pp. 1580-1585, (2001); Al-Jalay B., Blank G., McConnel B., Al-Khayat M., Antioxidant activity of selected spices used in fermented meat sausage, J Food Protect, 50, pp. 25-27, (1987); Shahidi F., Pegg R.B., Saleemi Z., Stabilization of meat lipids with ground spices, J Food Lipids, 2, pp. 145-153, (1995); Banias C., Oreopoulou V., Thomopoulos C.D., The effect of primary antioxidants and synergists on the activity of plant extracts in lard, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 69, pp. 520-524, (1992); Contreras-Padilla M., Yahia E.M., Changes in capsaicinoids during development, maturation, and senescence of chile peppers and relation with peroxidase activity, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 2075-2079, (1998); Kosuge S., Furata M., Studies on the pungent principle of Capsicum.

Comparison of the Kramer measurements between pairs of subsamples gave correlation coefficients of 0.85 for prerigor (2h after slaughter), 0.78 for post-rigor (6 days after slaughter) and 0.97 for pre- and post-rigor combined. TPA gave non-significant correlations between subsamples. VIS/NIR fibre optic probe measurements gave cross-validated correlation coefficients for prediction of Kramer shear force of 0.76 for pre-rigor, 0.68 for post-rigor and 0.94 for pre- and post-rigor combined. Classification using linear discriminant analysis of the VIS/NIR measurements gave up to 79% correct classification into three categories: Low Kramer shear force (2.13 × 10-2-4.41 × 10-2J g-1), medium Kramer shear force (4.41 × 10-2-6.37 × 10-2J g-1) and high Kramer shear force (6.37 × 10-2-7.90 × 10-2J g-1). Using these class limits, no low-Kramer-shear-force sample was misclassified as a high-Kramer-shear-force sample, and vice versa. It can be concluded that non-destructive VIS/NIR fibre optic probe measurement gives fair predictions of Kramer shear force.

The changes in dielectric properties during meat ageing were also analyzed for each meat quality class. For these purposes, dielectric spectra were measured from 100 Hz to 0.4 MHz in parallel and in perpendicular to muscle fiber directions. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in dielectric constant and loss factor among classes were observed at 24 and 48 h post-mortem. Thus, the use of dielectric properties to detect low meat qualities is more reliable at 24 h after slaughtering. Moreover, two indexes for evaluating meat ageing were developed from dielectric properties with good results. This research is the first step for developing a sensor based on electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies for controlling pork meat quality. The results are promising and some definite frequencies are demonstrated to be useful for these purposes. Industrial Relevance: The results of this research article are demonstrated to be useful for discriminating low meat qualities (PSE and DFD meats). Thus, the industrial relevance is clear in this case because the detection of low meat qualities is identified as one of the most important challenges of meat industry nowadays. On the other hand, basing on the results of the present paper it is possible to develop a prototype for industrial applications. Moreover, two possible Indexes are developed in the present paper for determining meat freshness which also can be considered important from an industrial point of view. All this determinations were made by using dielectric spectroscopy which can be considered an emerging technology.

Analysis of total content of β-glucan in the malted samples showed small changes after steeping at the high temperature (48°C), while steeping at the lower temperature (15°C) gave a significantly lower content. This trend was even stronger for β-glucan unextractable at 38°C. Analysis of the activity of β-glucanase for the samples steeped at 15°C showed a strong increase over the time of germination, while those steeped at 48°C had a much slower development. The other two factors influenced the outcome to a small extent, mainly because the steeping temperature was the most important factor overall where any changes in β-glucan and β-glucanase were observed. When β-glucan was extracted at 100°C, a larger yield was obtained, and this was influenced by the steeping temperature in a much stronger way than for β-glucan extracted at 38°C. Determination of average molecular weight for β-glucan extracted at 100°C gave a lower value for samples steeped at 15 than at 48°C. The design did not have any large effects on phytate degradation and phytase activity. However, it indicated that selective control of the enzymes might be possible, since phytase activity was barely affected by the parameters studied, while β-glucanase was heavily affected. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","β-glucan;

The use of various strong and weak acids did not result in differences in protein precipitation, which on average occurred to a maximum of 60% of total protein at pH 3. Weak acids did, however, result in precipitates with a higher resolubility at pH 7 compared with strong acids. At pH 5, addition of FeCl3 or ZnCl2 increased both precipitation and resolubility compared with the situation without additives. The largest increases in both precipitation and resolubility were achieved using organic solvents at pH 5 as an additive, resulting in a maximum precipitation and maximum resolubility at pH 7 of 91 and 83% of total protein respectively. The results described in this study lead to the hypothesis that precipitation and resolubilisation of potato proteins from PFJ are not determined by their isoelectric pH but by their interactions with low-molecular-weight components. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Acids; Metal salts; Organic solvents; Potato; Protein; Solubility","Solanum tuberosum; food science","","","","","","","Knorr D., Kohler G.O., Betschart A.A., Potato protein concentrates: The influence of various methods of recovery upon yield, compositional and functional characteristics, J Food Technol, 12, pp. 563-580, (1977); Kapoor A.C., Desborough S.L., Li P.H., Potato tuber proteins and their nutritional quality, Potato Res, 18, pp. 469-478, (1975); Knorr D., Protein quality of the potato and potato protein concentrates, Lebensm Wiss Technol, 11, pp. 109-115, (1978); Kinsella J.E., Functional properties in foods: A survey, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 7, pp. 219-280, (1976); Lindner P., Keren R., Ben-Gera I., Precipitation of proteins from potato juice with bentonite, J Sci Food Agric, 32, pp. 1177-1182, (1981); Gonzalez J.M., Lindamood J.B., Desai N., Recovery of protein from potato plant waste effluents by complexation with carboxymethylcellulose, Food Hydrocolloids, 4, pp. 355-363, (1991); Wojnowska I., Poznanski S., Bednarski W., Processing potato protein concentrates and their properties, J Food Sci, 47, pp. 167-172, (1981); Boruch M., Makowski J., Wachowicz M., Dubla W., Rückgewinnung der stickstoffverbindungen aus kartoffelfruchtwasser, Nahrung, 33, pp. 67-76, (1989); Meister E., Thompson N.R., Physical-chemical methods for the recovery of protein from potato chip processing, J Agric Food Chem, 24, pp. 919-923, (1976); Knorr D., Effect of recovery methods on yield, quality and functional properties of potato protein concentrates, J Food Sci, 45, pp. 1183-1186, (1980); Knorr D., Effects of recovery methods on the functionality of protein concentrates from food processing wastes, J Food Process Eng, 5, pp. 215-230, (1982); Official Methods of Analysis, 13th edn., (1980); Betschart A.A., Nitrogen solubility of alfalfa protein concentrates as influenced by various factors, J Food Sci, 39, pp. 1110-1114, (1974); Laemmli U.K., Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4, Nature, 227, pp. 681-685, (1970); Pots A.M., De Jongh H.H.J., Gruppen H., Hamer R.J., Voragen A.G.J., Heat-induced conformational changes of patatin, the major potato tuber protein, Eur J Biochem, 252, pp. 66-72, (1998); Seibles T.S., Studies on potato proteins, Am Potato J, 56, pp. 415-425, (1979); Salt D.J., Leslie R.B., Lillford P.J., Dunill P., Factors influencing protein structure during acid precipitation: A study of soya proteins, Eur J Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 14, pp. 144-148, (1982); Hoare M., Dunill P., Precipitation of food proteins and their recovery by centrifuging and ultrafiltration, J Chem Technol Biotechnol, 34 B, pp. 199-205, (1983); Lindner P., Kaplan B., Weiler E., Ben-Gera I., Fractionation of potato juice proteins into acid-soluble and acid-coagulable fractions, Food Chem, 6, pp. 323-335, (1980); Pots A.M., De Jongh H.H.J., Gruppen H., Hessing M., Voragen A.G.J., The pH dependence of the structural stability of patatin, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 2546-2553, (1998); Creighton T.E., Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties, pp. 263-264, (1996); Zachariou M., Hearn M.T.W., Application of immobilized metal ion chelate complexes as pseudocation exchange adsorbents for protein separation, Biochemistry, 35, pp. 202-211, (1996); Haslam E., Plant Polyphenols, Vegetable Tannins Revisited, (1989); Mila I., Scalbert A., Iron withholding by plant polyphenols and resistance to pathogens and rots, Phytochemistry, 42, pp. 1551-1555, (1996); McDonald M., Mila I., Scalbert A., Precipitation of metal ions by plant polyphenols: Optimal conditions and origin of precipitation, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 599-606, (1996); Ferrali M., Signorini C., Caciotti B., Sugherini L., Ciccoli L., Giachetti D., Comporti M., Protection against oxidative damage of erythrocyte membrane by the flavonoid quercetin, FEBS Lett, 416, pp. 123-129, (1997); McManus J.P., Davis K.G., Beart J.E., Gaffney S.H., Lilley T.H., Haslam E., Polyphenol interactions.

AA was studied in 1999 and 2000, DHAA in 1999 only. Pears from normal and very late harvest stored immediately or after a delay in a controlled atmosphere with 2% O2 and low (0.7%) or high (5%) CO2 were compared. DHAA content did not change during storage in any treatment. AA decreased in storage according to an exponential model. The rate of AA loss was different in the two years and was higher in late-harvest fruits and in those stored in 5% CO2. BH appeared in different treatments when AA decreased below a threshold, which was about 2mg kg-1 fresh weight, corresponding to 5% of the AA content at harvest. The frequency and severity of symptoms depended linearly on the time spent by fruits in low-ascorbate conditions. Advanced maturity at harvest and storage in high CO2 determine the appearance of BH and increase the rate of AA loss, probably through a reduction in the turnover of antioxidants. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Ascorbic acid; Brown heart; Dehydroascorbic acid; Delayed controlled atmosphere; High CO<sub>2</sub> concentration; Maturity at harvest; Pears (Pyrus communis L cv Conference)","Pyrus; Pyrus communis; food science","","","","","","","Bertolini P., Bottardi S., Dalla Rosa M., Folchi A., Effect of controlled atmosphere storage on the physiological disorders and quality of Conference pears, Ital J Food Sci, 4, pp. 303-312, (1997); Veltman R.H., Larrigaudiere C., Wichers H.J., Van Schaik A.C.R., Van der Plas L.H.W., Oosterhaven J., PPO activity and polyphenol content are nor limiting factors during brown core development in pears (Pyrus communis L cv Conference), J Plant Physiol, 154, pp. 697-702, (1999); Veltman R.H., Sanders M.G., Persijn S.T., Peppelenbos H.W., Oosterhaven J., Decreased ascorbic acid levels and brown core development in pears (Pyrus communis L cv Conference), Physiol Plant, 107, pp. 39-45, (1999); Shewfelt R.L., Purvis A.C., Toward a comprehensive model for lipid peroxidation in plant tissue disorders, HortSci, 30, pp. 213-218, (1995); Cooke J.R., The chemical estimation of vitamin C, Vitamin C, (1974); Veltman R.H., Kho R.M., Van Schaik A.C.R., Sanders M.G., Oosterhaven J., Ascorbic acid and tissue browning in pears (Pyres communis L cvs Rocha and Conference) under controlled atmosphere conditions, Postharv Biol Technol, 19, pp. 129-137, (2000); Streif J., Optimum harvest date for different apple cultivars in the 'Bodensee' area, in Cost 94, The Postharvest Treatment of Fruit and Vegetables: Determination and Prediction of Optimum Harvest Date of Apples and Pears, pp. 15-20, (1996); Rizzolo A., Brambilla A., Valsecchi S., Eccher Zerbini P., Evaluation of sampling and extraction procedures for the analysis of ascorbic acid from pear fruit tissue, Food Chem, 77, pp. 257-262, (2002); Chiari M., Nesi M., Carrea G., Righetti P.G., Determination of total vitamin C in fruits by capillary zone electrophoresis, J Chromatogr, 645, pp. 197-200, (1993); Lentheric I., Pinto E., Vendrell M., Larrigaudiere C., Harvest date affects the antioxidative systems in pear fruits, J Hort Sci Biotechnol, 74, pp. 791-795, (1999); Lee S.K., Kader A.A., Preharvest and postharvest factors influencing vitamin C content of horticultural crops, Postharv Biol Technol, 20, pp. 207-220, (2000); Agar I.T., Streif J., Bangerth F., Effect of high CO<sub>2</sub> and controlled atmosphere (CA) on the ascorbic and dehydro-ascorbic acid content of some berry fruits, Postharv Biol Technol, 11, pp. 47-55, (1997); Saquet A., Streif J., Bangerth F., Changes in ATP, ADP and pyridine nucleotide levels related to the incidence of physiological disorders in 'Conference' pears and 'Jonagold' apples during controlled atmosphere storage, J Hort Sci Biotechnol, 75, pp. 243-249, (2000); Walker M.A., McKersie B.D., Role of the ascorbate-glutathione antioxidant system in chilling resistance of tomato, J Plant Physiol, 141, pp. 234-239, (1993); Gonzalez-Meler M.A., Ribas-Carbo M., Siedow J.N., Drake B.G., Direct inhibition of plant mitochondrial respiration by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, Plant Physiol, 112, pp. 1349-1355, (1996); Frenkel C., Patterson M.E., Effect of carbon dioxide on ultrastructure of 'Bartlett' pears, HortSci, 9, pp. 338-340, (1974); Peppelenbos H.W., Oosterhaven J., A theoretical approach on the role of fermentation in harvested plant products, Acta Hort, 464, pp. 381-386, (1998); Kumar G.N.M., Knowles N.R., Oxidative stress results in increased sinks for metabolic energy during aging and sprouting of potato seed-tubers, Plant Physiol, 112, pp. 1301-1313, (1996)","","","","","","","","","00225142","","","","English","J.

In this study, we have used Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmahl., the donor of the D-genome to bread wheat, and identified water-soluble germination inhibitors in its bracts. Germination of non-dormant T. tauschii grains was significantly delayed by imbibition in undiluted leachate (crude extract) from the bracts, whereas any dilution of the crude extract (1/10, 1/100 or 1/1000) resulted in no inhibition. Removal of proteins larger than 10 kDa from the crude extract resulted in increased germination inhibition compared with the crude extract. When purified, free phenolic compounds present in the crude extract were found to inhibit germination, but to a lesser extent than the crude extract, possibly due to losses during purification. HPLC of the free phenolic fraction indicated the presence of more than 30 compounds. Peak fractions were collected and tested for inhibitory properties. Two fractions significantly inhibited grain germination for 3 d, with one fraction, determined to contain vanillic acid, continuing to inhibit germination after 5 d. Exogenously applied vanillic acid at a concentration of 0.2 mg mL-1 was shown to significantly inhibit germination compared with water-imbibed grains. The germination inhibitor mechanism detected in the bracts surrounding the grain of T. tauschii in this study has the potential to provide protection against pre-harvest sprouting in bread wheat.","","Aegilops tauschii; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Viscum; Viscum album; Crops; Genes; High performance liquid chromatography; Proteins; food science; wheat; Germination inhibitors; Plants (botany)","","","","","","","Adkins S.W., Simpson G.M., The physiological basis of seed dormancy in Avena fatua.

An Agilent 85070E open-ended coaxial probe connected to an Agilent E8362B vector network analyzer were used in these experiments. All determinations were made at 30 °C from 500 MHz to 20 GHz. These assays were performed in order to consider the potential use of dielectric spectroscopy for determining the state of fruit maturity. Good correlations among apples Thiault Index with a new defined Dielectric Maturity Index were found. The Dielectric Maturity Index was related to loss factor at two punctual frequencies (0.5 GHz and dipolar relaxation frequency). This work is presenting a non-destructive control method for the prediction of climacteric fruits maturity. Industrial relevance: The results of this research article are demonstrated to be useful for determining apple maturity. Thus, the industrial relevance is clear because the determination of fruit maturity is important to decide the best uses and storage time of the fruit. In the paper, a Maturity Index based on dielectric properties was developed. The results are obtained for the concrete application of apple fruit but they can be extended to other climacteric fruits although more studies are necessary. Dielectric spectroscopy, which can be considered an emerging technology, has the advantage of being an objective and a non destructive technique. For all these reasons we are sending to this journal ""Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies"" our results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Climacteric fruits; Dielectric properties; Dielectric spectra; Dielectric spectroscopy; Malic acid; Maturity index","Malus x domestica; Acids; Dielectric devices; Dielectric properties; Dielectric spectroscopy; Electric network analysis; Electric network analyzers; Innovation; Sugar (sucrose); Agilent; Apple fruits; Climacteric fruits; Concrete applications; Dielectric measurements; Dielectric spectra; Dipolar relaxation frequency; Emerging technologies; Food science; Fruit maturity; Good correlations; Loss factor; Malic acids; Maturity indices; Non-destructive control; Non-destructive technique; Open-ended coaxial probe; Storage time; Sugar content; Vector network analyzers; Fruits","","","","","","","Official Methods of Analysis, (1984); Castro-Giraldez M., Fito P.J., Chenoll C., Fito P., Development of a dielectric spectroscopy technique for determining key chemical components of apple maturity, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 58, pp. 3761-3766, (2010); Feldman Y., Ermolina I., Hayashi Y., Time domain dielectric spectroscopy study of biological systems, IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation, 10, 5, pp. 728-753, (2003); Gabriel C., Dielectric properties of biological materials, Bioengineering and Biophysical Aspects of Electromagnetic Fields, Handbook of Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, pp. 51-100, (2006); Guo W., Nelson S., Trabelsi S., Kays S.J., 10-1800-MHz dielectric properties of fresh apples during storage, Journal of Food Engineering, 83, 4, pp. 562-569, (2007); Harker F.R., Marsh K.B., Young H., Murray S.H., Gunson F.A., Walker S.B., Sensory interpretation of instrumental measurements 2: Sweet and acid taste of apple fruit, Posthasvest Biology and Technology, 24, pp. 241-250, (2002); Hulme A.C., Some aspects of the biochemistry of apple and pear fruits, Advances in Food Research, pp. 297-413, (1958); Hulme A.C., Dones J.D., Wooltorton L.S., The respiration climacteric in apple fruits, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 158, pp. 514-535, (1963); Kader A.A., Barret D.M., Classification, composition of fruits and postharvest maintenance of quality, Processing Fruits: Science and Technology, 1, pp. 1-24, (1996); Lal Kaushal B.B., Sharma P.C., Apple, Handbook of Fruit Science and Technology: Production, Composition, Storage and Processing, pp. 91-122, (1995); Lanahan A., Black R., Ecker J.R., Hookless1, an ethylene response gene, is required for differential cell elongation in the Arabidopsis hook, Cell, 85, pp. 183-194, (1996); Lewis M.J., Physical Properties of Foods and Food Processing Systems, pp. 61-62, (1987); Mansour R., Latche A., Vaillant V., Pech J.C., Reid M.S., Metabolism of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in ripening apple fruits, Physiology Plant, 66, pp. 495-502, (1986); Metaxas A.C., Meredith R.J., Industrial Microwave Heating, IEE Power Engineering Series, 4, (1993); Nelson S.O., Datta A.K., Dielectric properties of food materials and electric field interactions, Handbook of Microwave Technology for Food Applications, pp. 69-114, (2001); Nelson S.O., Guo W., Trabelsi S., Kays S.J., Dielectric spectroscopy of watermelons for quality sensing, Measurement Science and Technology, 18, pp. 1887-1892, (2007); Nelson S.O., Trabelsi S., Kays S.J., Dielectric spectroscopy of honeydew melons from 10 MHz to 1.8 GHz for quality sensing, Transactions of the ASAE, 49, 6, pp. 1977-1982, (2006); Pearson J.A., Roberson R.N., The physiology of growth in apple fruits.

The contents of selenium, vitamin C and tea polyphenol in green teas were greatly increased by foliar application of selenium-enriched fertilizer. No significant differences of the contents of vitamin C, amino acid and tea polyphenol were observed between green tea treated with sodium selenite and that without selenium. The selenium-enriched green tea exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activity than regular green tea, both in linoleic acid oxidation and in the lard oxidation system. These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of green tea is significantly enhanced by the combination of selenium and green tea constituents compared with that of regular green tea. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Antioxidant activity;

They are the most prevalent antioxidants in the diet and come in various forms, distinguished by the presence of hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings. Two important phenolic compounds are gallic and kojic acid. Gallic acid is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry as a food additive, antitumor, anti-viral, and anti-mutagenic agent. Kojic acid is a natural tyrosinase inhibitor clinically used to cure human skin hyperpigmentation and has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Therefore, kojic acid is used in food and cosmetic products. For the detection of gallic and kojic acid, many conventional techniques have been utilized, such as high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, electrochemical methods provide simple, low-cost, fast, and a wide range of concentration analyses for these phenolic acids. Through the development in materials science, modification of an electrode surface with alternative materials such as conductive polymers, molecularly imprinted polymers, or nanoparticles ensures versatile, selective electrochemical sensors for monitoring gallic and kojic acid. They offer simplicity regarding sensor preparation, measurement, and cost-efficiency. Therefore, the present review highlights the recent developments in developing electrochemical sensors for monitoring gallic and kojic acid. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Electrochemical sensors; Food safety; Gallic acid; Kojic acid","Cost benefit analysis; Diseases; Electrodes; High performance liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phenols; Aromatic rings; Cardiovascular disease; Electrochemical monitoring; Fatal disease; Food science; Food-safety; Gallic acids; Hydroxyl groups; Kojic acid; Phenolic compounds; Electrochemical sensors","","","","","","","Anand U., Jacobo-Herrera N., Altemimi A., Lakhssassi N., A comprehensive review on medicinal plants as antimicrobial therapeutics: potential avenues of biocompatible drug discovery, Metabolites, 9, (2019); Guan R.R., Le Q.V., Yang H., Zhang D.Q., Gu H.P., Yang Y.F., Sonne C., Lam S.S., Zhong J.T., Jianguang Z., Liu R.Q., Peng W.X., A review of dietary phytochemicals and their relation to oxidative stress and human diseases, Chemosphere, 271, (2021); Vuolo M.M., Lima V.S., Marostica M.R., Phenolic Compounds: Structure, Classification, and Antioxidant Power, pp. 33-50, (2019); Qin F.X., Hu T.J., You L.X., Chen W., Jia D.S., Hu N.N., Qi W.H., Electrochemical detection of gallic acid in green tea using molecularly imprinted polymers on TiO<sub>2</sub>@CNTs nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode, Int.

The additives used were NaCl at three levels (0 (control), 10 and 20 g kg-1) and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) also at three levels (0 (control), 3 and 6 g kg-1). The fish meat was massaged with the additives at <15°C for 1 h. The massaged fish paste was then packed into steel stainless tubes and cooked at 40°C for 30 min followed by 90°C for 15 min. Changes in mechanical properties (texture profile analysis and punch test), solubility, electrophoretic profile and expressible water were evaluated. Hardness was in the range from 26.3 to 52.4N, cohesiveness varied from 0.185 to 0.318 and springiness varied from 0.418 to 0.768. Increasing the amount of both additives improved the mechanical and functional properties of the restructured silver carp products. MTGase activity was associated with a decrease in protein solubility and a decrease in the myosin band (SDS-PAGE). Increasing NaCl decreased the amount of expressible water. The results indicated that it is feasible to obtain low-salt restructured silver carp products with improved mechanical and good functional properties using 3 g kg-1 MTGase and 10 g kg-1 NaCl. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Fish; Restructured; Salt; Texture; Transglutaminase","Cyprinus carpio; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; fish; food science","","","","","","","Kuraishi C., Sakamoto J., Yamazaki K., Susa Y., Kuhara C., Soeda T., Production of restructured meat using microbial transglutaminase without salt or cooking, J Food Sci, 62, pp. 488-490, (1997); Gomez-Guillen C., Solas T., Montero P., Influence of added salt and non-muscle proteins on the theology and ultrastructure of gels made from minced flesh of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), Food Chem, 58, pp. 193-202, (1997); Su Y.K., Bowers J.A., Zayas J.F., Physical characteristics and microstructure of reduced fat frankfurters as affected by salt and emulsified fats stabilized with nonmeat proteins, J Food Sci, 65, pp. 123-128, (2000); Boyer C., Joandel S., Ouali A., Culioli J., Ionic strength effects on heat-induced gelation of myofibrils and myosin from fast-and slow-twitch rabbit muscles, J Food Sci, 61, pp. 1143-1148, (1996); Ramirez J.A., Martin-Polo M.O., Bandman E., Fish myosin as affected by freezing and initial physical state, J Food Sci, 65, pp. 556-560, (2000); Narhinen M., Nissinen A., Penttila P.L., Somonen O., Ceruerud L., Puska P., Salt content labelling of foods in supermarkets in Finland, Agric Food Sci Finland, 7, pp. 447-453, (1998); Yetim H., Ockerman W., The effects of egg white, tumbling and storage time on proximate composition and protein fractions of restructured fish product, J Aquat Food Prod Technol, 4, pp. 65-77, (1995); Zimmerman P.A., Bissel H.M., McIntosh G.S., Method of processing salmonoid fish; Borderias A.J., Perez-Mateos M., Productos pesqueros reestructurados, Alimentaria, 269, pp. 53-62, (1996); Baker K.H., Lanier T.C., Green D.P., Cold restructuring of seafoods using transglutaminase-mediated binding, 2000 IFT Ann Meet Book of Abstr 75, (2000); Aeschlimann D., Paulson M., Transglutaminase: Protein cross-linking enzymes in tissues and body fluids, Thromb Haemost, 71, pp. 402-415, (1994); Ramirez J.A., Rodriguez-Sosa R., Morales O.G., Vazquez M., Surimi gels from striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) employing microbial transglutaminase, Food Chem, 70, pp. 443-449, (2000); Tsukamasa Y., Shimizu Y., Setting property of sardine and Pacific mackerel meta, Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi, 56, pp. 1105-1112, (1990); Ohtsuka T., Umezawa Y., Nio N., Kubota K., Comparison of deamidation activity of transglutaminases, J Food Sci, 66, pp. 25-29, (2001); Jiang S.T., Hsieh J.F., Ho M.L., Chung Y.C., Microbial transglutaminase affects gel properties of golden threadfin-bream and pollack surimi, J Food Sci, 65, pp. 694-699, (2000); Ramirez J.A., Santos I.A., Morales O.G., Morrissey M.T., Vazquez M., Application of microbial transglutaminase to improve mechanical properties of surimi from silver carp, Cienc Tecnol Aliment, 3, pp. 21-28, (2000); Kim B.Y., Park J.W., Rheology and texture properties of surimi gels, Surimi and Surimi Seafood, pp. 267-324, (2000); Cooper T.G., The Tools of Biochemistry, pp. 53-55, (1977); Laemmli U.K., Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4, Nature, 227, pp. 680-685, (1970); Sano T., Noguchi S.F., Matsumoto J.J., Tsuchiya T., Effect of ionic strength on dynamic viscoelastic behavior of myosin during thermal gelation, J Food Sci, 55, pp. 51-55, (1990); Yamamoto K., Electron microscopy of thermal aggregation of myosin, J Biochem, 108, pp. 896-898, (1990); Sharp A., Offer G., The mechanism of formation of gels from myosin molecules, J Sci Food Agric, 58, pp. 63-73, (1992); Kamath G.G., Lanier T.C., Foegeding E., Hamann D.D., Nondisulfide covalent cross-linking of myosin heavy chain in 'setting' of Alaska pollock and Atlantic croaker surimi, J Food Biochem, 16, pp. 151-172, (1992); An H., Wei C.I., Zhao J., Marshall M.R., Lee C.M., Electrophoretic identification of fish species used in surimi products, J Food Sci, 54, pp. 253-257, (1989); Ramos-Martinez E., Morales-Gonzalez O.G., Ramirez J.A., Garcia-Carreno F.L., Montejano-Gaitan J.G., Determination of the modori phenomenon and its origin in surimi of five fish species from the Gulf of Mexico, Food Sci Technol Int, 5, pp. 397-405, (1999)","J.A.

Adding antioxidants is one approach to control lipid oxidation, and several delivery strategies have been applied, such as supplementing antioxidants to the feed, direct mixing into minces, or, for whole muscle pieces; spraying, glazing, and injection. However, some issues linked to these technologies hinder their wide utilization, such as low effectiveness, noncompatibility with clean label, and off-flavor. These shortcomings have promoted the development of new antioxidant delivery technologies. In this review, the main focus is on the principles, characteristics, and implementation of five novel antioxidant delivery methods in different types of muscle food products. Their advantages and drawbacks are also summarized, plus comments about future trends in this area. Among novel routes to deliver antioxidants to muscle foods are, for whole tissues, recyclable dipping solutions; for minces, encapsulation; and, for both minces and whole tissues, cross-processing with nonmuscle antioxidant-containing raw materials as well as applications of edible films/coatings and active packaging. Advantages of these technologies comprise, for example, low price, the possibility to control the antioxidant release rate, overcoming strong aromas from natural antioxidants, and allowing antioxidant-containing raw materials from the food industry to be valorized, providing an opportunity for more circular food production. © 2022 The Authors.

Available diet data from these species allow us to predict some interference competition for food resources in sympatric populations. We checked the food interference hypothesis in a sympatric population. The diet of both predators was analyzed through scat collection. Seasonal differences in biomass consumption were compared between both species in those items considered as key resources according to biomass consumption. Strawberry tree fruits can be considered as key resource exclusively for genets whereas fungi, blackberries and rabbits are keys for stone martens only. For other key resources consumed by both species (wood mouse and figs) we suggest that a possible mechanism to reduce diet overlap could be the sequential use of these resources: no intensive exploitation by both species of the same key resource during the same season was detected. Figs and wood mouse were used alternatively. Although strawberry tree fruits and blackberry are exclusive key resources of one of the species, their consumptions showed the same pattern. Diet niche overlap in our study is low compared with other carnivore communities suggesting that exclusive use of some key resources and sequential use of shared ones is an optimal scenario to reduce overall competition for food resources. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

AM technology can be used in three-dimensional (3D) food fabrication in an additive manner based on computer-aided design (CAD) data. 3D food printing technology offers many advantages over traditional methods: rapid prototyping without using molds or casts, providing customized foods, creating foods with complex shapes and structures, personalized nutrition, high efficiency, and low cost of production. It is crucial to have a systematic approach for food printings and redefine the printability to use a wide range of food materials. Scope and approach: This review article summarizes recent advances in 3D food printing with a focus on current approaches to define the printability and optimize the food ink formulas, the mechanisms of AM technology, and the suitability of food materials as precursors for 3D printing (3DP). The major steps associated with 3DP technology from the food perspective are elucidated in this review, which involve various approaches and strategies of 3DP. Key findings and conclusions: A systematic manufacturing approach is essential for a better understanding of the 3DP process rather than focusing on the machine parts. Framing each step in the 3DP and depicting the workflow suitable for food printings may simplify the research steps and accelerate high-quality 3DP for the food applications. Redefining the printability and summarizing existing approaches to obtain printable food materials will lay the foundation for future studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D; Additive manufacturing; Food; Material; Printing","Additives; Agricultural robots; Computer aided design; Complex shapes; Emerging technologies; Food applications; Food materials; Food science; High-efficiency; Printing technologies; Threedimensional (3-d); 3D printers","","","","","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA, (2020-67030-31336); University of Missouri, MU; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering","Funding text 1: This research was partially supported by the Robert T.

The nutritional pyramid advises eating 5 servings of fruit and vegetables a day as a basic principle of a healthy diet, as they provide essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber and antioxidants. Consuming them in adequate quantities improves the immune system and helps prevent diseases such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Among the most nutrient-dense nutrients in fruit and vegetables are antioxidants. This is the context for this review, in which an exhaustive analysis has been carried out of the bioactive compounds with antioxidant capacity available in the most widely produced fruit and vegetables in Spain, considering not only the studies that identify these types of compounds, but also those that analyze their effects on human health. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the interest of the extraction of antioxidant compounds in by-product streams from fruit and vegetable processing in the context of the circular economy. Therefore, this review also includes examples of green technologies for the extraction of antioxidants from waste fractions. In this field, microwave and ultrasound-assisted extraction technologies have been found to be the most efficient, both in terms of extraction yields, which are similar to those of conventional technologies, and in terms of the operating conditions required for the process. However, enzyme cocktails or pulsed electric fields also show promising results. © 2022 The Author(s)","Flavonoids; Food science; Fruits and vegetables; Green extraction technologies; Natural antioxidants; Vitamins","Diseases; Electric fields; Extraction; Fruits; Nutrients; Nutrition; Vegetables; Vitamins; Basic principles; Essential nutrients; Extraction technology; Flavonoid; Food science; Fruit and vegetables; Green extraction technology; Green extractions; Healthy diet; Natural antioxidants; Antioxidants","","","","","Horizon 2020, (ED431E 2018/01, GRC ED431C 2017/29)","Funding text 1: This research has been financially supported by the European project iFermenter (Grant Agreement 79057. iFermenter is a project funded under the “Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme”.

Although zein, the major corn protein, is a promising protein source for food applications, it lacks important functional properties that could expand its utilization. Thus, zein functionalization is warranted and is studied in different research fields. Scope and approach: This review provides an overview of the possible advantages of enzymatic and chemical modifications of zein and reports current and future applications of this chemistry in processing of zein in various food applications. The protein-modifying enzymes used for zein functionalization for different food applications in last three decades are discussed, along with the mechanisms of action such as crosslinking, deamidation, glycosylation and hydrolysis. Use of natural compounds or safe chemical methods for zein functionalization for possible food applications are also reviewed, including chemical crosslinking and deamidation. Key findings and conclusions: The enzymatic and chemical alteration of zein, such as crosslinking, deamidation and hydrolysis, may be very useful tools for modifying the functionality of zein for a wide range of food applications. Thus, developing understanding of the relationship between functional properties of modified zein and the degree of modification could directly translate to increased incorporation of higher quality zein-based food products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deamidation; Enzymatic/chemical crosslinking; Zein functionalization","Chemical modification; Food products; Hydrolysis; Deamidation; Enzymatic/chemical crosslinking; Food applications; Food science; Functional properties; Functionalizations; Protein sources; Research fields; Science research; Zein functionalization; Crosslinking","","","","","Guangdong Technion Israel Institute of Technology, (86438202); Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","JG is the recipient of the Lady Davis Fellowship.

This is generally due to the coexistence of domains with different physicochemical properties separated by many interfaces which control the apparent thermodynamic equilibrium. This feature was and is still largely studied to design pharmaceutical delivery systems. In food science, the recent intensification of in vitro digestion tests to complement the in vivo ones holds promises in the identification of the key parameters controlling the bioaccessibility of nutrients and micronutrients. In this review, we present the developments of in vitro digestion tests for dispersed food systems (mainly emulsions, dispersions and gels). We especially highlight the evidences detailing the roles of the constituting multiscale structures. In a perspective section, we show the potential of structured interfaces to allow controlled bioaccessibility. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Bioavailability; controlled release; hydrolysis;

At 20°C, slight browning was observed and could be evaluated by furosine, furfural and total HMF indicators. At 55°C, formula type A (pasteurised, spray-dried and reconstituted) showed more browning in nitrogen storage conditions than did type B.

In a circular bioeconomy vision, insects receive great attention as a sustainable alternative to satisfy food and nutritional needs. Among all insects, Tenebrio molitor (TM) is the first insect approved by the European Food Safety Authority as a novel food in specific conditions and uses, testifying its growing relevance and potential. This review holistically presents the possible role of TM in the sustainable and circular solution to the growing needs for food and nutrients. We analyze all high value-added products obtained from TM (powders and extracts, oils and fatty acids, proteins and peptides, and chitin and chitosan), their recovery processes (evaluating the best ones in technical and environmental terms), their nutritional and economical values, and their biological effects. Safety aspects are also mentioned. TM potential is undoubted, but some aspects still need to be discussed, including the health effects of substances and microorganisms in its body, the optimal production conditions (that affect product quality and safety), and TM capacity to convert by-products into new products. Environmental, economic, social, and market feasibility studies are also required to analyze the new value chains. Finally, to unlock the enormous potential of edible insects as a source of nutritious and sustainable food, it will be necessary to overcome the cultural, psychological, and regulatory barriers still present in Western countries. © 2021 The Authors.

A comparison was also made between the enzyme-treated (ET) and untreated (UT) standard diet for pigs, and chyme which originated from pigs fed that diet, to determine whether the enzyme treatment resulted in material with similar fermentability to that reaching the large intestine in vivo. The enzyme pretreatment was performed according to a modified in vitro method of Babinszky et al (J Sci Food Agric 50:173-178 (1990)). Generally, it was shown that the fermentabilities of the ET and UT substrates were different. There was also a significant difference between the fermentation characteristics of the ET diet and chyme. Chyme produced less gas (P < 0.05), and the time at which half of the gas had been produced (C) occurred later (P < 0.05). The maximum rate of fermentation (RM) was slower for chyme (P < 0.05). Fermentation of chyme led to more ammonia (P < 0.05) and a tendency to more volatile fatty acids at the end of fermentation. These differences in fermentability of the ET diet and chyme (from pigs fed the same diet) may be the result of differences which relate purely to the action of the enzymes chosen to work in vitro, compared with those which are actually present in vivo. However, the results also suggest that it is not only enzymatic digestion which is occurring in the small intestine. This is an important consideration when using ileal techniques to determine digestibility of feedstuffs. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carbohydrates; Chyme; Cumulative gas production; Enzyme pretreatment; Fermentability; Fermentation kinetics; Large intestine; Pig; Small intestine","Mammalia; Solanum tuberosum; Sus scrofa; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; fermentation; food science","","","","","","","Drake A.P., Fuller M.F., Chesson A., Simultaneous estimations of precaecal protein and carbohydrate digestion in the pig, In vitro Digestion for Pigs and Poultry, pp. 162-176, (1991); Eggum B.O., Boisen S., In vitro techniques of measuring digestion, Proceedings of the Vth International Symposium on Digestive Physiology in Pigs, pp. 213-225, (1991); Babinszky L., Van Der Meer J.M., Boer H., Den Hartog L.A., An in vitro method for prediction of the digestible crude protein content in pig feeds, J Sci Food Agric, 50, pp. 173-178, (1990); Mosenthin R., Physiology of small and large intestine of swine - Review, Asian-Aust J Anim Sci, 11, pp. 608-619, (1998); Williams B.A., Verstegen M.W.A., Tamminga S., Fermentation in the monogastric large intestine: Its relation to animal health, Nutr Res Rev, 14, pp. 207-227, (2001); Bach Knudsen K.E., Borg Jensen B., Andersen J.O., Hansen I., Gastrointestinal implications in pigs of wheat and oat fractions. 2.

The species also behaved differently in terms of the increase in solubility, which occurred earlier in octopus (after 2 months) than in pota (after 5-6 months). Thereafter, solubility gradually declined. The values for solubility of proteins from mantle of both pota and octopus in 5% NaCl were greater in young specimens than in mature samples. There was no clear gender-dependent tendency. The acid solubility of collagen also increased in most lots up to the sixth month, after which it characteristically began to decline. Pota collagen was significantly more soluble in mantles than in arms. In octopus mantle, collagen solubility gradually declined. In the sexually developed phases (immature and mature), no gender-dependent differences were detected in the solubility of collagen from octopus mantle and arms. However, values did tend to be slightly higher in females. The mantles of immature specimens of pota and octopus were more suitable for freezing. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Cephalopods; Collagen; Frozen storage; Muscle; Myofibrillar; Solubility","Cephalopoda; Eledone; Eledone cirrhosa; Octopus; Todaropsis eblanae; food science","","","","","","","Sikorski Z.E., Kolodziejska I., The composition and properties of squid meat, Food Chem, 20, pp. 213-224, (1986); Mangold K., Reproduction, Cephalopods Life Cycles, 2, pp. 157-200, (1987); Ayensa M.C., An H., Montero P., Gomez-Guillen C., Borderias J., Partial protease activity characterization of squid Thoradopsis eblanae mantle, Food Sci Technol Int, 5, pp. 391-396, (1999); Hurtado J.L., Borderias J., Montero P., An H., Characterization of proteolytic activity in octopus (Octopus vulgaris) arm muscle, J Food Biochem, 23, pp. 469-483, (1999); Montero P., Borderlas J., Influence of age on connective tissue in trout (Salmo irideus Gibb), J Sci Food Agric, 51, pp. 169-261, (1990); Morales J., Montero P., Moral A., Isolation and partial characterization of two types of muscle collagen in some cephalopods, J Agric Food Chem, 48, pp. 2142-2148, (2000); Jimenez-Colmenero F., Borderias A.J., A study of the effects of frozen storage of certain functional properties of meat and fish protein, J Food Technol, 18, pp. 731-737, (1983); Hultin H.O., Feng Y., Stanley D.W., A re-examination of muscle protein solubility, J Muscle Foods, 6, pp. 91-107, (1995); Sikorski Z.E., Olley J., Kostuch S., Protein changes in frozen fish, CRC Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 8, pp. 97-129, (1976); Jimenez-Colmenero F., Tejada M., Borderias A.J., Effect of seasonal variations on protein functional properties of fish during frozen storage, J Food Biochem, 12, pp. 159-170, (1988); Montero P., Borderias J., Behaviour of myofibrillar proteins and collagen in hake (Merluccius merluccius L) muscle during frozen storage and its effects on texture, Z Lebensm Untersuch Forsch A, 190, pp. 112-117, (1990); Montero P., Borderias J., Comportamiento de las proteinas miofibrilares y colágeno de músculo de trucha (Salmo irideus Gibb) durante su conservación en estado congelado y su implicación en la textura, Agroquim Tecnol Alim, 30, pp. 377-385, (1990); Takahashi T., Squid meat and its processing, Fish as Food, 4, pp. 13-35, (1965); LeBlanc R.J., Gill T.A., Comparative study of proteolysis in short-finned (Illex illecebrosus) and long-finned (Loligo pealei Lesseur) squid, Comp Biochem Physiol, 13 B, pp. 201-210, (1982); Matsumoto J.J., On the protein composition of squid muscle, Bull Jpn Soc Sci Fish, 24, pp. 133-139, (1958); Montero P., Morales J., Ruiz-Capillas C., Moral A., A contribution to determination of protein solubility and characterization in cephalopods, 24th Western European Fish Technologists Association (WEFTA) Meet, (1994); Ironside J.I.M., Love R.M., Studies on protein denaturation in frozen fish.

The first section emphasizes the effects that water activity, glass transition, and plasticization have on temperature, water content, and time-dependant phenomena affecting the shelf life of low and intermediate moisture foods. The remaining chapters discuss how mechanical handling and temperature, irradiation, and packaging all influence shelf life. Section two, on chemical factors, examines the benefits of controlled atmosphere storage and modified atmosphere packaging on vegetables, fruits, grains, and oilseeds. The remaining chapters compare the effectiveness of antioxidants, emulsifiers, stabilizers, and sulfur dioxide to enhance food quality. The remaining chapter in this section deals with the application of biotechnology for improving shelf life. Intended for food science professionals as well as students, Food Shelf Life Stability presents the fundamental principles that are applied to maintaining a high food quality for an extended period of time. © 2001 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Chemical stability; Glass transition; Modified atmosphere packaging; Oils and fats; Sulfur dioxide; Water content; Chemical factors; Controlled atmosphere storage; Food quality; Food science; Fundamental principles; Intermediate-moisture foods; Mechanical handling; Water activity; Food preservation","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","","","","","","978-142003665-7; 978-084938976-4","","","English","Food Shelf Life Stab.: Chemical, Biochemical, and Microbiological Changes","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84885984482"

Spears of two cultivars, Eposs and Gijnlim, were collected from two locations in Poland, Swidwowiec and Poznan, on sandy and sandy loam soil, respectively. Fusarium oxysporum and F. proliferatum were detected at an average incidence of 38.3% and 15.8% in the spear sections sampled, respectively. In stands of 11 (tested) cultivars of asparagus sampled in Germany on sandy soil, the same species dominated, however, they were less frequent than in Poland (26.6% and 5.6% of the spears infected with F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum, respectively). Chemical analyses revealed that fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and moniliformin (MON) were present in some of the spears sampled in Poland. FB 1 was not found and MON was not assessed in spears sampled in Germany in 2002, but F. proliferatum was able to form the toxin in vitro in the range from 101.4 up to 205.8 μg/kg maize kernel substrate. Asparagus samples in Poland contained FB 1 at up to 5.6 μg/kg spear fresh weight. The highest MON concentration (1350 μg/kg) was detected in cultivar Eposs in Marcelin, Poland, in 2002. MON and FB 1 were found in spears infected by both F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum, however, only the latter fungus was able to synthesize both toxins. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.","Asparagus decline; Asparagus stem and crown rot; Food contamination; Fusarium diseases; Secondary metabolites","Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Poland; Asparagus; Fungi; Fusarium; Fusarium oxysporum; Fusarium proliferatum; Zea mays; food science; fungal disease; toxin; vegetable","","","","","","","Barnett H.L., Hunter B.B., Illustrated Genera of Imperfect Fungi, (1998); Bobko P., Correlation and Regression, (2001); Bogartz R.S., An Introduction to the Analysis of Variance, (1994); Booth C., The Genus Fusarium, (1971); Chelkowski J., Zawadzki M., Zajkowski P., Logrieco A., Bottalico A., Moniliformin production by Fusarium species, Mycotoxin Res, 6, pp. 41-44, (1990); Doko M.B., Visconti A., Occurrence of fumonisins B1 and B2 in corn and corn-based human foodstuffs in Italy, Food Addit Contam, 11, pp. 433-439, (1994); Duncan D.B., Multiple range and multiple test, Biometrics, 11, pp. 1-42, (1955); Elmer W.H., Incidence of infection of asparagus spears marketed in Connecticut by Fusarium spp, Plant Dis, 84, pp. 831-834, (2000); Elmer W.H., Johnson D.A., Mink G.I., Epidemiology and management of the diseases causing to asparagus decline, Plant Dis, 80, pp. 117-125, (1996); Franceschi S., Bidoli E., Baron A.E., La Vecchia C., Maize and risk of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus in Northeastern Italy, J Natl Cancer Inst, 82, pp. 1407-1411, (1990); Gerlach W., Nirenberg H., The Genus Fusarium. a Pictorial Atlas; Golinski P., Kostecki M., Lasocka I., Wisniewska H., Chelkowski J., Kaczmarek Z., Moniliformin accumulation and other effects of Fusarium avenaceum (Fr.)

In the enzymatic extraction process, macerated ripe banana pulp was incubated with a commercial enzyme preparation (Pectinex Ultra SP-L) at 50°C for 2h. In the mechanical extraction process the ripe banana pulp was mixed with stretched strips of polythene and worked with a dough mixer at room temperature for 20min (on average) until the juice appeared. Significantly (p < 0.05) higher 'pure' juice yield (604g kg-1 pulp) was obtained with the enzymatic method than with the mechanical method (541g kg-1 pulp). However, adding water to the spent pulp from the mechanical process and extracting dilute juice improved the juice yield to 757g kg-1 pulp. The enzyme-extracted juice had significantly (p < 0.05) higher soluble solids, titratable acidity, fructose, glucose, total nitrogens density and mineral potassium. However, the mechanically extracted juice had significantly higher sucroses pH and viscosity. Although the mechanical extraction process suffers from occasional juice extraction failures, it offers an opportunity to extract banana juice without excessive energy expenditure, and the juice produced is wholesome with a superior flavour to that produced by the enzymatic method. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Banana juice; Enzymatic extraction; Kayinja bananas (ABB genotype); Mechanical extraction","food science","","","","","","","Speiser W., Enzymes and the fruit juice industry - A love affair?, Fruit Process, 2, pp. 8-39, (1993); Tocchini R.P., Lara J.C.C., Manufacture of natural and concentrated banana juice, Bol Inst Technol Alim, Brazil, 51, pp. 93-112, (1977); Viquez F., Lastreto C., Cooke R.D., A study of the production of banana juice using pectinolytic enzymes, J Food Technol, 16, 2, pp. 115-125, (1981); Koffi E.K., Sims C.A., Bates R.P., Viscosity reduction and prevention of browning in the preparation of clarified banana juice, J Food Qual, 14, pp. 209-218, (1991); Sims C.A., Bates R.P., Arreola A.G., Colour, polyphenoloxidase and sensory changes in banana juice as affected by heat and UF, J Food Qual, 17, pp. 371-379, (1994); Kyamuhangire W., Banana juice extraction and processing, (1990); Kyamuhangire W., Pehrson R., Adaptation of the traditional banana juice extraction technology to a mechanical process and factors that influence juice release, Acta Hort, 490, pp. 577-582, (1998); Aked J., Kyamuhangire W., Postharvest aspects of highland bananas in Uganda, Trop Sci, 36, pp. 54-64, (1996); Dorreich K., New fruit juice technologies with enzymes, Proc 23rd Symp of International Federation of Fruit Juice Producers Budapest, pp. 51-62, (1993); Schreier P., Drawert F., Steiger G., Mick W., Effect of enzyme treatment of apple pulp with a commercial pectinase and cellulase on the volatiles of the juice, J Food Sci, 43, pp. 1797-1800, (1978); Voragen A.G.J., Wolters H., Verdonschot-Kroef T., Rombouts F.M., Pilnik W., Effect of juice releasing enzymes on juice quality, Proc 19th Syrup of International Federation of Fruit Juice Producers The Hague, pp. 453-462, (1986); Poll L., The effect of pulp holding time and pectolytic enzyme treatment on acid content in apple juice, Food Chem, 47, pp. 73-75, (1993); Thompson A.K., Burden O.J., Harvesting and fruit care, Bananas and Plantains, pp. 403-433, (1995); Von Loesecke H.W., Bananas, (1949); Official Methods of Analysis, 16th edn., (1995); SAS User's Guide: Statistics, (1990); Sole P., Bananas (processed), Processed Fruits: Science and Technology, Major Processed Products, pp. 361-386, (1996); Casimir J.D., Countercurrent extraction of soluble solids from foods, CSIRO Food Res, 43, pp. 38-43, (1983); Binkley C.R., Wiley R.C., Continuous diffusion extraction method to produce apple juice, J Food Sci, 43, pp. 1019-1023, (1978); Wills R.B.H., Lim J.S.K., Greenfield H., Composition of Australian foods - Tropical and subtropical fruit, Food Technol Aust, 38, 3, pp. 118-123, (1986)","","","","","","","","","00225142","","","","English","J.

In this study, we have developed a two-step molecular tool to detect the presence of hake DNA (Merluccius spp.) and to identify the exact hake species present in an blind sample. The first test involves PCR amplification of an ITS1-rDNA fragment of 193 bp using nested primers that are interspecifically conserved in Merluccius spp. and Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. The second test consists of the PCR amplification of a 602-659 bp DNA fragment spanning part of the ribosomal cluster 18S-ITS1-5.8S and digesting it with four restriction enzymes whose targets map at interspecifically nonconserved sites of the ITS1. Alternatively, the identification of hake species can be achieved by FINS or BLAST, using the nucleotide sequence of either the whole ITS1 sequence or its nested fragment of 193 bp. Because of their high reproducibility and ease of execution, these procedures allow for routine analysis and constitute high reliable tools for the rapid identification of 12 species of hake. © 2005 American Chemical Society.","Food science; Hakes; ITS1-rDNA marker; Merluccius spp.; Preliminary exclusion test; RFLPs; Species identification; Traceability","Animals; Base Sequence; DNA; DNA, Intergenic; DNA, Ribosomal; Gadiformes; Gadus morhua; Molecular Sequence Data; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Reproducibility of Results; Sequence Alignment; Species Specificity; Gadus morhua; Merluccius; Rexea solandri; DNA; ribosome DNA; spacer DNA; animal; article; Atlantic cod; chemistry; classification; comparative study; Gadiformes; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; reproducibility; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sequence alignment; species difference","","DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, Intergenic, ; DNA, Ribosomal, ","","","","","Inada T., Studies on merluciid fish, Bull.

It is widely used in several scientific fields, particularly in that of food. Due to its excellent detection and prediction capacities, metabolomics well suited to analyze such complex matrix. This review emphasizes the most commonly used food metabolomics analytical technologies with a focus on novel approaches that have emerged in recent years, highlighting their suitability for food samples analysis as aided by chemometric data visualization. A comparison is presented among different metabolomics platforms and their prioritization for which metabolite classes in food. Application of metabolomics are presented in the context of food composition analysis, food quality safety, and food traceability. Furthermore, the constraints and limitations of actual metabolomics applications are explored, bringing novel insights into metabolomics use in food science to maximize its application potential in that major industrial sector. © 2022 The Author(s)","Analytical technologies;

This has always been a fundamental aspect of the human (and perhaps animal) eating experience and has been known to food preparers as well as discerning consumers since the very beginning of food preparation. However, the development of technical and business expertise in food texture optimization and design using structured multidisciplinary tools is a more recent development. As culinary arts, food science, materials science, sensory science, and the study of consumer behavior have evolved in scope and complexity; it is now possible to develop a view of how the ability to study and optimize texture can drive consumer choice. The science and technology of designing and optimizing food texture have evolved significantly in recent years and continue to do so at a rapid pace. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

All types were sized into three fractions (5 < D < 6 mm, 6 < D < 7 mm and D > 7 mm) by screening with round-hole sieves. Samples were tested for popping quality and suitability for popping, and the sensory properties of the popcorns were evaluated. A popcorn popper with a maximum operating temperature of 226°C was used for popping the samples (25g). Both kernel type and size affected the expansion volume and the number of unpopped kernels. Yellow pearl-type (YPT) and white rice-type (WRT) popcorns showed good popping performance. The popping properties of the smallest-sized kernels were better than those of the other fractions. Popcorn type significantly affected the flake size uniformity, flake shape uniformity, flake colour, crispness and taste of the products. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that that kernel size was of great importance for the expansion volume, which was negatively correlated with number of unpopped kernels, 1000-kernel weight and diameter ratio and positively correlated with flake size, kernels per 25 g, crispness and tenderness. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Kernel size; Kernel type; Popcorn; Popping quality; Sensory properties","food science","","","","","","","Ziegler K.E., Ashman R.B., Popcorn, Specialty Corns, pp. 189-214, (1994); Song A., Eckhoff S.R., Paulsen M., Litchfield J.B., Effect of kernel size and genotype on popcorn popping volume and number of unpopped kernels, Cereal Chem, 68, pp. 464-467, (1991); Willier J.G., Brunson A.M., Factors affecting the popping quality of popcorn, J Agric Res, 35, pp. 615-624, (1927); Eldredge J.C., Lyerly P.J., Popcorn in Iowa, Iowa Agric Exp Stn Bull, 54, (1943); Haugh C.G., Lien R.M., Hanes R.E., Ashman R.B., Physical properties of popcorn, Trans Am Soc Agric Eng, 19, pp. 168-176, (1976); Hoseney R.C., Zeleznak K., Abdelrahman A., Mechanism of popcorn popping, J Cereal Sci, 1, pp. 43-52, (1983); Lin Y.E., Anantheswaran R.C., Studies on popcorn in a microwave oven, J Food Sci, 53, pp. 1746-1749, (1988); Lyerly P.J., Some genetic and morphological characteristics affecting the popping expansion of popcorn, J Soc Agron, 34, pp. 986-999, (1942); Pordesimo L.O., Anantheswaran R.C., Fleischmann A.M., Lin Y.E., Hanna M.A., Physical properties as indicators of popping characteristics of microwave popcorn, J Food Sci, 55, pp. 1352-1355, (1990); Eldredge J.C., Thomas W.I., Popcorn - Its production, processing and utilization, Iowa Agric Exp Stn Bull, 127, (1959); Song A., Eckhoff S.R., Optimum popping moisture content for popcorn kernels of different sizes, Cereal Chem, 71, pp. 458-460, (1994); Metzger D.D., Hsu K.H., Ziegler K.E., Bern C.J., Effect of moisture content on popcorn popping volume for oil and hot-air popping, Cereal Chem, 66, pp. 247-248, (1989); Mohamed A.A., Ashman R.B., Kirleis A.W., Pericarp thickness and other kernel physical characteristics relate to microwave popping quality of popcorn, J Food Sci, 58, pp. 342-346, (1993); Stroshine R., Tuite J., Crane P., Effect of kernel physical properties on shelled corn thin-layer drying rates, Winter Meet American Society of Agricultural Engineers, (1987); Walton F.K., Popcorn kernel damage, (1968); Rooney L.W., Serna-Saldivar S.O., Food uses of corn, Corn Chemistry and Technology, pp. 399-429, (1987); Hoseney R.C., Principles of Cereal Science and Technology, 2nd edn.

The anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated acids justify their inclusion in enteral nutrition formulas that have been associated with disease remission. However, there have been variable data in clinical trials to test supplementary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in inducing or maintaining remission in these diseases. Although variability in trial design has been suggested as a major factor, we suggest that variability in processing and presentation of the products may be equally or more important. The nature of the source, and rapidity of getting the fish or other food source to processing or to market, will affect the percentage of the various fatty acids, possible presence of heavy metal contaminants and oxidation status of the various fatty acids. For dietary supplements or fortified foods, whether the product is encapsulated or not, whether storage is under nitrogen or not, and length of time between harvest, processing and marketing will again profoundly affect the properties of the final product. Clinical trials to test efficacy of these products in IBD to date have utilised the relevant skills of pharmacology and gastroenterology. We suggest that knowledge from food science, nutrition and engineering will be essential to establish the true role of this important group of compounds in these diseases. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Biological Availability; Clinical Trials as Topic; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Drug Stability; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Fatty Acids, Omega-6; Food Technology; Food, Fortified; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Treatment Outcome; Experiments; Fatty acids; Heavy metals; Nutrition; Polyunsaturated fatty acids; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; Anti-inflammatory effects; Clinical trial; Crohn's disease; Developing solutions; Dietary supplements; Enteral nutrition; Food science; Food sources; Fortified foods; Inflammatory bowel disease; Long chains; Major factors; Metal contaminants; Omega-3; Ulcerative colitis; Variable data; bioavailability; clinical trial (topic); Crohn disease; diet; diet supplementation; drug stability; enteritis; food handling; human; nutrition; review; treatment outcome; ulcerative colitis; Chemical contamination","","Fatty Acids, Omega-3, ; Fatty Acids, Omega-6, ","","","","","Ferguson L.R., Philpott M., Dryland P., Cell.

The contents of total lipids, neutral lipids, polar lipids and phospholipids were measured. The composition of phospholipids was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their fatty acid composition was analysed by gas chromatography. The phospholipid content ranged from 3.6 to 6.4g kg-1 soft tissue. PE (phosphatidyl ethanolamine) and PC (phosphatidyl choline) were the major constituents. C16:0, C20:5 and C22:6 were the major fatty acids. C20:5 (5.25-23.10%) and C22:6 (6.05-20.42%) varied regularly with the seasonal factors. Their total amounts were high from January to June, which would be an optimal time for the utilisation of the phospholipids of mussels. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); Mussel; Phospholipid; Seasonal change","Mytilus; Mytilus edulis; food science; lipid; mollusc","","","","","","","Land W.E.M., Fish and Human Health, (1986); Takahashi K., Ichioka K., Hatano M., Zama K., Seasonal variation of sardine (Sardinops melanosticta) muscle lipids and other components, Bull Fac Fish Hokkaido Univ, 36, pp. 248-275, (1985); Folch J., Less M., Sloane-Stanley G.H., A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues, J Biol Chem, 266, pp. 497-509, (1957); Xue C., Wang Y., Li Z., Lou W., Changes in lipids of mussel during storage, J Fish Sci China, 2, 4, pp. 56-63, (1995); Dittmer J.C., Lester R.L., A simple, specific spray for the detection of phospholipids on thin-layer chromatograms, J Lipid Res, 5, pp. 126-127, (1964); Xu Y., Chen J., Wang Y., The analysis of phospholipid in seed of Juglans regia and acinus of Citrullus vulgaris, Acta Nutr Sinica, 14, pp. 203-205, (1992); Zeng C., Qin Y., Kang F., Analysis of major phospholipid classes in biomembrane by high performance liquid chromatography, Acta Univ Sci Med Chongqing, 19, pp. 105-108, (1994); Ackman R.G., Hooper S.N., Physiological changes in Mytilus edulis L induced by temperature and nutritive stress, J Marine Biol Assoc UK, 53, pp. 39-58, (1973); Hayashi K., Takagi T., Composition of diacyl glyceryl ethers in the liver lipids of ratfish Hydrolagus novaezealandiae, Bull Jpn Soc Sci Fish Nissuishi, 46, pp. 855-861, (1980); Beninger P.G., Seasonal variations of the major lipid classes in relation to the reproductive activity of two species of clams raised in a common habitat: Tapes decussatus L (Jeffreys, 1863) and T philippinarum (Adams and Reeve, 1805), J Exp Marine Biol Ecol, 79, pp. 79-90, (1984); Kattner G., Krause M., Trahmsis J., Lipid composition of some typical North Sea copepods, J Marine Ecol Prog Ser, 4, pp. 69-74, (1981); Bandarra N.M., Batista I., Nunes M.L., Empis J.M., Christie W.W., Seasonal changes in lipid composition of sardine, J Food Sci, 62, pp. 40-42, (1997); Kluytmans J.H., Boot J.H., Oudejans R.C.H.M., Zandee D.I., Fatty acid synthesis in relation to gametogenesis in the mussel Mytilus edulis L., Comp Biochem Physiol B, 81, pp. 959-963, (1985); Sargent J.R., The Structure, Metabolism and Function of Lipids in Marine Organisms.

Two of the authors independently evaluated the manuscripts for relevance. Bibliometric data, including citation count, were analyzed together with the words in the titles and abstracts of the 100 most cited berry-related papers. RESULTS: Seventy-two of the 100 most cited papers were research articles. Most of them were published during the 2000s, and related to subject areas of agricultural and biological sciences (n=64), biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology (n=35), chemistry (n=29), medicine (n=24), and nursing (n=10). Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry was the dominating choice of publication outlet (n=26). CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidant and anticancer benefits appeared to be the major subject terms. Berries that were mentioned in at least 10% of the 100 papers were strawberry, blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, blackberry, bilberry, and grape berry. The review could provide a valuable guide for designing future studies based on berries, berry extracts, and bioactive compounds. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Since the protected geographical indication Interdonato lemon of Messina possesses high organoleptic properties, the composition of the hexane extract of lemon peel was determined by HRGC and HRGC–MS analyses and compared with that of lemon of different cultivars. The results obtained are informative of the oil’s quality and explain the variation of the lemon essential oil composition.

Rose hip essential oil is mainly comprised of alcohols, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. This chapter highlights the traditional uses and food science applications of rose hips and the essential oil of a valuable and widespread species-namely, Rosa canina L.-in comparison with other rose bush species. © 2016 by Elsevier, Inc..

Scenario modeling is an adequate tool for assessing the implications of such decisions, but for an enlightened debate, it is important to make explicit and transparent how such value-based decisions affect modeling results. In a participatory approach working with five NGOs, we developed a future food vision for the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) through an iterative process of defining the scenario, modeling, and revising the scenario, until a final future food vision was reached. The impacts on food production, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions, and the resulting diets in the food vision, were modeled using a mass flow model of the food system. The food vision formulated was an organic farming system where food is produced locally and livestock production is limited to “leftover streams,” i.e., by-products from food production and forage from pastures and perennial grass/clover mixtures, thus limiting food-feed competition. Consumption of meat, especially non-ruminant meat, was substantially reduced compared with current consumption in the Nordic countries (− 81%). An estimated population of 37 million people could be supplied with the scenario diet, which uses 0.21 ha of arable land and causes greenhouse gas emissions of 0.48 tCO2e per diet and year. The novelty of this paper includes advancing modeling of sustainable food systems by using an iterative process for designing future food visions based on stakeholder values, which enables results from multidisciplinary modeling (including agronomy, environmental system analysis, animal and human nutrition) to be fed back into the decision-making process, providing an empirical basis for normative decisions and a science-based future vision of sustainable food systems. © 2018, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Default livestock; Food system; Food-feed competition; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use; Leftovers; Livestock; Local; Organic","Denmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden; Animalia; agricultural application; alternative agriculture; arable land; decision making; farming system; food consumption; food production; food science; future prospect; greenhouse gas; land use; livestock farming; nongovernmental organization; organic farming; participatory approach; stakeholder; sustainability","","","","","Department of Energy and Technology; Nordisk Ministerråd; Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, SLU","Funding This study was funded by the Department of Energy and Technology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Nordic Council of Ministers.","Amine E., Baba N., Belhadj M., Deurenberg-Yap M., Djazayery A., Forrestre T., Galuska D., Herman S., James W., M'buyamba Kabangu J., Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases, World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser, 916, (2003); Andren O., Katterer T., Karlsson T., ICBM regional model for estimations of dynamics of agricultural soil carbon pools, Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 70, pp. 231-239, (2004); Antman A., Brubaek S., Andersen B.H., Lindqvist K., Markus-Johansson M., Sorensen J., Teerikangas J., Nordic agriculture air and climate: baseline and system analysis report, (2015); Bajzelj B., Richards K.S., Allwood J.M., Smith P., Dennis J.S., Curmi E., Gilligan C.A., Importance of food-demand management for climate mitigation, Nat Clim Chang, 4, pp. 924-929, (2014); Burney J.A., Davis S.J., Lobell D.B., Greenhouse gas mitigation by agricultural intensification, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 107, pp. 12052-12057, (2010); Connor D.J., Organic agriculture cannot feed the world, Field Crop Res, 106, pp. 187-190, (2008); de Ponti T., Rijk B., van Ittersum M.K., The crop yield gap between organic and conventional agriculture, Agric Syst, 108, pp. 1-9, (2012); Enghardt-Barbieri H., Lindvall C., De svenska näringsrekomendationerna översatta till livsmedel [The Swedish nutrition recommendations translated into food items], (2003); Eurostat regional yearbook, Agricultural Census 2010, (2016); FAOSTAT Database, (2017); Foley J.A., Ramankutty N., Brauman K.A., Cassidy E.S., Gerber J.S., Johnston M., Mueller N.D., O'Connell C., Ray D.K., West P.C., Balzer C., Bennett E.M., Carpenter S.R., Hill J., Monfreda C., Polasky S., Rockstrom J., Sheehan J., Siebert S., Tilman D., Zaks D.P.M., Solutions for a cultivated planet, Nature, 478, pp. 337-342, (2011); Garnett T., Three perspectives on sustainable food security: efficiency, demand restraint, food system transformation.

In Experiment 2 the same three histidine doses as in Experiment 1 were used, but this time the histidine was accompanied by 8g L-methionine, 28g L-lysine and 2.5g L-tryptophan, to ensure that histidine remained first-limiting over the whole dose range.

The highest gelation ability was obtained at low pH (around 5.6) whatever the ionic strength. No effect of ionic strength was observed at pH 5.6; however, at pH 6.0, lowering the salt (KC1) concentration to 0.3M or less improved the characteristics of the gels formed. The effects of pH and ionic strength on myofibrils from both muscle types appeared to be similar, but red muscle proteins were less sensitive to changes in their physicochemical environment. Consequently, the differences between muscle types appeared to be dependent on pH and ionic strength. Solubility measurements revealed large differences between muscle types and between different pH values. Ultrastructural observations confirmed that different kinds of gels were formed depending on the physicochemical conditions and muscle type origin. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Fish; Heat-induced gelation; Ionic strength; Muscle type; pH","Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; food science","","","","","","","Lefevre F., Culioli J., Joandel-Monier S., Ouali A., Muscle polymorphism and gelling properties of myofibrillar proteins from poultry, mammals, and fish, Quality Attributes of Muscle Foods, pp. 365-391, (1999); Cofrades S., Careche M., Carballo J., Colmenero F.J., Thermal gelation of chicken, pork and hake (Merluccius merluccius, L) actomyosin, Meat Sci, 47, pp. 157-166, (1997); Davies J.R., Bardsley R.G., Ledward D.A., Poulter D.A., Myosin thermal stability in fish muscle, J Sci Food Agric, 45, pp. 61-68, (1988); Wicker L., Lanier T.C., Hamann D.D., Akahane T., Thermal transitions in myosin-ANS fluorescence and gel rigidity, J Food Sci, 51, pp. 1540-1543, (1986); Beas V.E., Wagner J.R., Crupkin M., Anon M.C., Thermal denaturation of hake (Merluccius hubbsi) myofibrillar proteins - A differential scanning calorimetric and electrophoretic study, J Food Sci, 55, pp. 683-687, (1990); Careche M., Currall J., Mackie I.M.A., Study of the effects of different factors on the heat-induced gelation of cod (Gadus morhua, L) actomyosin using response surface methodology, Food Chem, 42, pp. 39-55, (1991); Autio K., Kiesvaara M., Polvinen K., Heat-induced gelation of minced rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri): Effect of pH, sodium chloride and setting, J Food Sci, 54, pp. 805-808, (1989); Lan Y.H., Novakofski J., McCusker R.H., Brewer M.S., Carr T.R., McKeith F.K., Thermal gelation of pork, beef, fish, chicken and turkey muscles as affected by heating rate and pH, J Food Sci, 60, pp. 936-940, (1995); Kim S.H., Carpenter J.A., Lanier T.C., Wicker L., Setting response of Alaska pollock surimi compared with beef myofibrils, J Food Sci, 58, pp. 531-534, (1993); Chen H.H., Thermal stability and gel-forming ability of shark muscle as related to ionic strength, J Food Sci, 60, pp. 1237-1240, (1995); Boyer C., Joandel S., Ouali A., Culioli J., Ionic strength effects on heat-induced gelation of myofibrils and myosin from fast- and slow-twitch rabbit muscles, J Food Sci, 61, pp. 1143-1148, (1996); Sano T., Noguchi S.F., Matsumoto J.J., Tsuchiya T., Effect of ionic strength on dynamic viscoelastic behavior of myosin during thermal gelation, J Food Sci, 55, pp. 51-54, (1990); Johnston I.A., Biochemistry of myosins and contractile properties of fish skeletal muscle, Mol Physiol, 2, pp. 15-29, (1982); Stickland N.C., Growth and development of muscle fibres in the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), J Anat, 137, pp. 323-333, (1983); Kiessling A., Storebakken T., Asgard T., Kiessling K.H., Changes in the structure and function of the epaxial muscle of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in relation to ration and age - I.

The 114 genotypes from the ICARDA collection and 2 genotypes selected from the Sicilian landrace Martinella were grown in the season 1994-95 in a representative durum wheat growing area in the hilly, inner part of Sicily, together with three cultivars widespread in the region of evaluation and used, therefore, as controls, viz. Simeto, Capeiti and Arcangelo. Analysis of total protein by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was made on the accessions, which were also evaluated for protein concentration, SDS sedimentation volume, mixograph test and pasta-making test. Uncommon high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits were found; HMW 2* and 3* subunits at the Glu-A1 locus might confer better quality than the null allelic form usually found at this locus. Even more evident was the positive effect of the HMW 6+17 subunit at the Glu-B1 locus. The results showed that the evaluated germplasm formed an interesting source of favourable glutenin subunits that might be very desirable in breeding activities for improving pasta-making quality. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The data were analysed using response surface methodology. The results showed the formation of new structures characterised by lower radial expansion (RE) and specific volume (SV) when gluten was added to CS. WG content was the most important variable affecting RE, water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), SV and difference in colour (ΔE) of the extruded products, but feed moisture content and barrel temperature also influenced RE. WAI was affected by a significant interaction between WG content and barrel temperature. The extruded products had lower WAI values and higher WSI values than WG-free products. Heat, high shear rate and high pressure during extrusion cooking caused mechanical destruction or denaturation of the WG and gelatinisation and dextrinisation of the starch components.

The field of functional food science (FFS) has been introduced to combat this. Functional foods are foods with added bioactive compounds which provide a clinically proven health benefit. However, FFS and food science (FS) are often viewed as one and the same. To progress in development and research in the field of FFS, the two must be viewed as separate. Currently, the FDA has not issued or accepted a formal definition for functional foods. In contrast, the FDA accepts and actively uses FS. This makes it difficult to regulate functional foods and weakens public trust. The FDA currently has a health claim authorization system in place, but it still fails to properly regulate functional foods. Other countries, such as Japan, have regulatory systems set in place specifically for functional foods. This increases public trust, as there is a strict process that a product has to go through before it is authorized for consumption. Countries such as Japan could serve as a model for a functional foods regulatory system in the United States. The Functional Food Center (FFC) has proposed a 15-step system similar to Japan's to authorize functional foods in the U.S. Due to a lack of governmental recognition, there is a large educational gap in secondary schools and higher educational institutions when it comes to FS and FFS. Courses and lessons regarding FS are more available to students than courses and lessons concerning FFS. In addition, the field of FFS faces the challenge of separating its work from the field of FS. Because FFS is concerned with creating functional food products (FFPs) that have a clinically proven health benefits, the scientific research in this field must meet rigorous standards to ensure that the FFP in question has substantial evidence for the health claim. It is important not only to acknowledge the distinction between these two fields, but also to understand the benefit this will have on the well-being of the general population. With FFS as an established field, research can be funded accordingly, and new functional foods can be developed that can prevent or lessen the symptoms of disease. Through regular analysis and measurements of specific biomarkers, FFPs can work alongside western medicine to combat disease and dysfunction. Finally, it is important that a major area of difference is the emphasis on quantity when it comes to FFS. Specific quantities must be outlined and followed in order for FFPs to function as they are intended. © FFC 2021.

However, olive oil extraction generates huge quantities of byproducts, including leaves, pomace residues, stones and wastewater, which have severe environmental impacts mainly because of their phytotoxicity and great organic content. Olive oil byproducts are regarded as inexpensive and abundant raw materials rich in bioactive compounds with high and varied health-related activities. Several phenolic compounds and terpenoids were recovered from olive byproducts using different conventional and advanced extraction methods due to their potential to be used in food, packaging, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Recently, the use of olive byproducts and their functional compounds to enhance the functional properties of packaging systems was investigated as a sustainable strategy for food preservation, fostering the sustainability of the olive-oil chain, and promoting circular economy. In this framework, the main goals of this review are to summarize the main bioactive compounds in olive byproducts, to review the main advancements in their extraction, purification, and characterization, and finally to discuss their applications in food packaging systems as well as safety-related aspects. © 2022 The Authors.

In this work, the physical and chemical characteristics of the oils and fruits from Syagrus romanzoffiana, Attalea phalerata, Mauritia flexuosa and for the first time for Attalea dubia (Mart.) Burret were determined. All fruits were dimensioned according to the biometric analysis (size and mass). Nutritional analysis showed high levels of lipids, proteins, sugars and fibers, as well as Ca, Mg, K, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn minerals. The composition of fatty acids showed the predominance of short and unsaturated fatty acids carbon chain. All fruits presented high content of polyphenols and carotenoids (except for S. romanzoffiana). Moreover, all fruits demonstrate antioxidant activity by direct capture of free radicals ABTS and DPPH. Finally, our results demonstrate that these fruits have a relevant concentration of nutrients and bioactive compounds with importance for human health. Such data open up promising prospects for the scientific exploration and use of these fruits as an alternative source to combat malnutrition as well as to compose formulations of food products with functional properties. Finally, our results demonstrate that these fruits present a relevant concentration of nutrients and bioactive compounds with importance for human health, with promising perspectives for the scientific exploration and use of these fruits as an alternative source to avoid malnutrition as well as to compose formulations of food products with functional properties. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Arecaceae’s fruits; Food science; Functional foods; Nutraceutical; Vegetable oil","Free radicals; Functional food; Nutrients; Nutrition; Plants (botany); Unsaturated fatty acids; Vegetable oils; Anti-oxidant activities; Arecaceae; Chemical characterization; Food science; Functional properties; Nutraceuticals; Physical and chemical characteristics; Scientific exploration; Fruits","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, FUNDECT","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful for financial support from CNPq, CAPES and FUNDECT.

The phytate (inositol hexaphosphate) content was analysed in 27 pea varieties; the influence of storage time and the difference in phytate content between the germ and the cotyledon were determined. Furthermore, degradation of inositol phosphates by the endogenous phytase enzyme was studied in pea flour, germ and cotyledon. To find the maximum phytate degradation, the effects of temperature and pH during pea flour incubation were investigated. The most efficient phytate degradation in pea flour incubation was achieved at pH 7.5 and 45°C. At this condition an almost complete degradation of phytate and a 66% reduction in the sum of inositol hexa-, penta-, tetra- and triphosphates were reached in 10 h. The storage time of pea seeds or removal of the germ did not have a major effect on the phytate content. Since several inositol pentaphosphate isomers were produced during phytate degradation, it can be concluded that peas contain several phytate-degrading enzymes, or one phytate-degrading enzyme with unspecific initial hydrolysation pattern. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Inositol phosphate; Phytase; Phytate; Pisum sativum","enzyme degradation; food storage; hydrolysis kinetics; pH; phytate; phytic acid; pisum sativum; storage temperature; food science","","","","","","","Cheryan M., Phytic acid interactions in food systems, CRC Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 13, pp. 297-335, (1980); Rossander L., Sandberg A.-S., Sandstrom B., Dietary fibre - A component of food, Nutritional Function in Health and Disease, pp. 197-216, (1992); Sandberg A.-S., Brune M., Carlsson N.-G., Hallberg L., Rossander-Hulten L., Sandstrom B., The effect of various inositol phosphates on iron and zinc absorption in humans, Bioavailability '93.

Increased farinograph dough work input (WI) and increased extensigraph resistance have emerged with current crop management practices. The dynamics of N and S uptake were studied in a factorial experiment with four commercial wheat cultivars known to differ in yield potential, grain N content, and dough rheological properties. Treatments consisted of three levels of N fertiliser (nil, early application of 150 kg N/ha in three splits, and 150 early + 100 kg N/ha applied at anthesis) and two S levels (nil and 50 kg S/ha at emergence). N fertiliser strongly increased N uptake in vegetative parts and grain. In contrast, there was little effect of S fertiliser on grain yield or grain N and S concentration or uptake. However, S fertiliser treatment did raise the level of S uptake in vegetative plant material. S treatment reduced the N:S ratio. However, N treatment consistently had a greater influence than S fertiliser on mixing requirement (WI and water absorption) and extensigraph tests. Opportunities to manage S nutrition during crop growth in order to influence dough or baking characteristics existed only under high N management. In this situation, there was a significant reduction in WI following S fertiliser application. Cultivar choice was the single best option for achieving the required flour characteristics. Flour from wheat cultivars 'Monad' and 'Otane' had strong dough rheological properties suggesting they were well suited to breadmaking. WI was higher in 'Monad' than 'Otane' even though grain S concentrations were lower. The differences in WI could partially be explained by their grain N:S composition. This was, in turn, influenced by the level of soil mineral N and sulphate.","Bread quality; Dough strength; Extensibility; Extensigraph resistance; N uptake; S uptake","Triticum aestivum; nitrogen fertilizer; sulfur; food science; wheat; bread; crop management; cultivar; fertilizer application; food quality; New Zealand; nitrogen concentration; nutrient uptake; plant growth; plant nutrient; soil quality","","sulfur, 13981-57-2, 7704-34-9","","","Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, FRST, (C02614)","This work wassupported by theZealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology under contract number C02614.

Food Technology Center, Purdue Univ., Lafayette IN, United States","The Micronutrient Initiative (MI) issued the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) a project to assess the extent to which iodized salt is used in processed foods, as well as food processors' level of knowledge on iodine nutrition. Iodine is an essential micronutrient required by the body that is found in a limited number of foods, thus many individuals require additional sources of iodine to meet their daily requirement. Without these additional sources, a range of disorders referred to as iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), including mental impairment, may become present, with over 2 billion people worldwide at risk due to insufficient iodine nutrition. IDD is especially damaging during the early stages of pregnancy and in early childhood. In their most severe form, IDD includes cretinism, stillbirth, and miscarriage, and increased infant mortality. Since 1994 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have recommended universal salt iodization (USI) as a safe, cost-effective, and sustainable strategy to ensure sufficient intake of iodine by all individuals. However, USI has in practice tended to focus only on table salt and not all salt destined for human consumption. Recent trends, particularly in industrialized countries, show that individuals are consuming the majority of their salt through processed foods, in which iodized salt is generally not used, rather than through iodized table salt. Additionally, recent initiatives to encourage reduced sodium consumption have prompted many consumers to reduce their intake of iodized table salt. While these trends in sodium consumption are more frequently observed in industrialized countries, they are expanding into many developing countries where iodine deficiency is also a concern. Thus countries which focus on iodization of table salt alone may not achieve optimal iodine nutrition of their population. This report provides an overview of the 2 Phases of this project. Phase I was to conduct an environmental scan/desk review of processed food consumption patterns in 39 countries selected by MI (see Table 1). Phase II was to conduct an electronic survey of food processors and detailed telephone interviews with a small sample of select company representatives from 16 countries (see Table 2). Per the scope of work, IFT conducted a desk review to determine the types and level of processed food consumption in the 39 countries of interest, as well as to identify suppliers of the major processed foods consumed and the use of salt as an ingredient in those products. Whenever possible, IFT also gathered information on the sodium content of widely consumed processed foods and the sources of salt currently used in these products; the types of processed foods and extent to which they are consumed by different socioeconomic groups; if iodized salt was used in processed foods; and whether or not there are policies in place to influence dietary salt reduction and how these efforts are implemented. For Phase II, IFT reached out to food company representatives to determine their use of iodized salt in processed food products; their sources of salt; their awareness of iodine nutrition and salt as a fortification vehicle; and their interest in learning more about salt iodization. For the purposes of this project, processed foods are considered to be all food products that have undergone a change of character or been altered from their original form. 1- Preselected countries (from MI) for Phase I of the iodized salt in processed foods project.

Australia Kenya Bangladesh Mexico Bolivia Nigeria China Pakistan Egypt Russia Ghana Senegal India South Africa Indonesia United Kingdom To complete the desk review, IFT conducted literature searches and Internet reviews for each of the 39 countries of interest from May to September 2010. IFT reached out to its members with expertise in the countries of interest and 3rd parties such as government agencies, food companies, salt suppliers, and nongovernmental organizations to gain contacts and information. The acquisition of literature or access to databases or other sources of information which are not freely available was limited. For Phase II, IFT sent an electronic survey to over 800 individuals from all 16 countries in October 2010. IFT reached out to its members and other contacts with expertise in the countries of interest, which included food companies and salt suppliers who were asked to complete the electronic survey, but also 3rd parties, such as academics, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and so on, who were asked to pass the survey along to their food industry contacts. Outreach included over 15 multinational food companies. The survey responses IFT received were limited; however, IFT made a substantial effort to obtain useful information for each country. IFT also used survey responses and personal e-mail communications to locate 10 food company representatives to participate in telephone interviews to gain more detailed information. Many of the 39 countries reviewed struggle with food insecurity, thus it was generally difficult to find food consumption data for these impoverished nations, particularly data on processed food consumption. Nationwide food consumption data were helpful to better understand processed food consumption for those countries that collected it; however, developing countries often lack the resources for such a large undertaking. Smaller, published academic studies were most useful in identifying types of foods that may be available in the different locales within a country, at times including minimally processed foods. IFT found that residents in many of the developing countries typically consume minimally processed foods such as bread and cheese, but that they do not frequently consume what are considered processed foods in ""Western"" society (packaged, prepared foods). Although processed foods may be available, consumption often differs based on income and region in the country. The more affluent and urban areas of countries appear more able to purchase processed foods, and therefore more likely to have a higher consumption rate. A pattern of processed food consumption or lack thereof did not present itself for the various country categories assigned to the 39 countries evaluated. Whether the country has a heavy or high IDD burden or an opportunity to progress did not correlate with the consumption of processed foods in that country. IDD is present in both developed and developing countries, and countries from each of these categories may or may not have processed foods available. Some countries with the heaviest burden for IDD may also have many processed foods available such as China, while another country with high IDD does not appear to have even minimally processed foods readily available. However, the majority of the European countries and Latin American countries identified on the list do have processed foods more readily available than some other countries identified, although not all are prepared with iodized salt. Many of the developing nations reviewed have the highest prevalence for IDD, often due to the high level of food insecurity. IDD is more closely linked to food insecure populations, which are also often low-income and rural populations, who lack access to food, including food that may have been prepared with iodized salt. Some of the developing countries have enacted legislation to combat high rates of IDD and require iodization of all salt to be consumed; however, they also often lack regulatory infrastructure and therefore lack effective methods to monitor and enforce salt iodization. For this reason, it appears that even when legislation and other efforts have been enacted, they are not comprehensively implemented. Future research needs surrounding iodine use in processed foods include the need for nationwide food consumption data and additional food science research. Nationwide food consumption data are most helpful to determine processed food consumption; however, developing countries often lack the resources for such a large undertaking. Nationwide food consumption information can also reveal sources of salt intake in the diet and help to determine vehicle(s) for iodized salt delivery. Food science research determines the amount of iodine that should be added to a product to still meet standards after food processing and time spent on a store or consumer's shelf, and to ensure that iodization does not impact the taste or other qualities of food products. Survey and telephone respondents reported potential challenges when using iodized salt in food products, including: trade barriers; increased costs; lack of resources and technical capability; lack of enforcement; instability of iodine; potential equipment and process overhauls; competing priorities; and consumer misconceptions. Salt suppliers also face challenges when iodizing salt in developing countries, as they may not have the technical capabilities, equipment, or resources to do so. The survey and telephone respondents indicate that food companies are willing to use iodized salt in food products; however, the use of iodized salt in food products may need to be mandated by law and effectively. © 2012 Institute of Food Technologists ®.","","Paullinia; Developing countries; Food processing; Food supply; Health risks; Industry; Iodine; Iodine compounds; Laws and legislation; Nutrition; Processed foods; Research; Sodium chloride; Stainless steel; Surveys; Telephone; Telephone sets; Trace elements; Afghanistan; Argentina; Australia; Bangladesh; Consumption rates; Democratic Republic of Congo; Electronic survey; Email communication; Ethiopia; European Countries; Finland; Food companies; Food consumption; Food industries; Food insecurity; Food processors; Food science; Government agencies; High rate; Human consumption; In-process; Indonesia; Industrialized countries; Infant mortality; Institute of Food Technologists; Iodine deficiency disorders; Ireland; Latin americans; Literature search; Me-xico; Mental impairments; Mozambique; Netherlands; New zealand; Niger; Nigeria; Nongovernmental organizations; Pakistan; Phase I; Phase II; Philippines; Pre-selected; Recent trends; Research needs; Rural population; Senegal; Small samples; South Africa; Sustainable strategies; Table salt; Tanzania; Technical capabilities; Time spent; Trade barriers; Ukraine; United kingdom; United Nations; Urban areas; Uruguay; World Health Organization; Chemical contamination","","","","","","","Abuye C., Berhane Y., The goitre rate, its association with reproductive failure, and the knowledge of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) among women in Ethiopia: cross-section community based study, BMC Public Health, 7, (2007); Adenew B., The food security role of agriculture in Ethiopia, J Agric Dev Econ, 1, 1, pp. 138-153, (2004); Akbay C., Boz I., Chern W.S., Household food consumption in Turkey, Eur Rev Agric Econ, 34, 2, pp. 209-231, (2007); Alasalvar C., (2004); Al-Mussali M.S., Al-Gahri M.A., Nutritive value of commonly consumed bread in Yemen, E-J Chem, 6, 2, pp. 437-444, (2009); Anderson C.A.M., Bellamy S., Figures M., Zeigler-Johnson C., Jalloh M., Spangler E., Coomes M., Gueye S., Rebbeck T., Dietary intake of Senegalese adults, Nutr J, 9, 7, (2010); Anderson C.A.M., Appel L.J., Okuda N., Brown I.J., Chan Q., Zhao L., Ueshima H., Kesteloot H., Miura K., Curb J.D., Yoshita K., Elliot P., Yamamoto M.E., Stamler J., Dietary sources of sodium in China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, women and men aged 40 to 59 years: the INTERMAP study, J Am Dietetic Assn., 110, 5, pp. 736-745, (2010); Ares G., Gambaro A., Food choice and food consumption frequency for Uruguayan consumers, Intl.

This spice is especially famous for its seed pods with characteristic aroma and taste. Due to well-established gastronomic value and flavoring properties, cardamom is widely used as a flavoring and spicy ingredient in curries and confectionery products. Due to the presence of a wide array of bioactives and volatile components with multiple activities, such as antioxidant, antihypertensive, gastroprotective, and antibacterial, this spice has significant potential for the development of value-added novel and processed functional foods and nutraceuticals. Cardamom essential oil has aromatherapy potential is also useful for the digestive system. The major components present in cardamom essential oils are α-terpinyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, and linalool. This chapter focuses on the nutritional and traditional pharmaceutical aspects as well as the food science applications of cardamom, in particular its essential oil. © 2016 by Elsevier, Inc..

Unstable quinonic forms were stabilised by sulphonation, and the resulting sulphones were quantified by coupled HPLC/ESI-MS. The effects of temperature and UV light on the oxidation of phenolic compounds were also investigated. The concentration of quinones increased with increasing temperature, but the kinetics of the reaction was independent of temperature. Likewise, more quinones were formed in the presence of UV light than in its absence, but UV light also did not affect the kinetics of the reaction.

Koku may be defined as the sensation that results from the complexity of the food (i.e., its richness or body), its lingering aftertaste or persistence, and its heartiness in terms of taste, aroma, and texture. A variety of substances have been found to impact significantly on koku, including umami substances, phytosterols, certain aromatic compounds, and kokumi substances. In Koku - Food Science and Physiology, readers will find full explanation of the conceptual aspects and the latest research results on a wide range of topics, including the relevant flavor chemistry and sensory analysis. Written by leading scientists in the field, the book will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in the fields of food chemistry, nutritional science, taste physiology, and neuroscience, as well as for professionals in the food industry. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Fermented food; Flavour; Flavour chemistry; Food science; Glutathione; Koku attribute; Koku sensation; Kokumi; Kokumi substance; Ornithine; Palatability; Phytosterols; Sensory perception; Sensory receptor; Taste; Umami","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Singapore","","","","","","","978-981138453-0; 978-981138452-3","","","English","Koku in Food Science and Physiology: Recent Research on a Key Concept in Palatability","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082409104"

The by-products studied were giant pumpkin, red pepper, stem broccoli, brewer's grain, fresh artichoke, scalded artichoke, lemon peel, orange peel and melon. The nutritive value was very variable, depending on the by-product and on the process applied to the material during industrial processing. In vitro gas production was measured for 500mg dry matter in quadruplicate at 39°C after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72h of incubation and fitted to single-pool exponential equations. The fermentation kinetics indicated that brewer's grain was the only by-product which fitted well with the p = a + b(1 - e-ct) equation model; all other by-products had a very fast degradation rate and their gas production fitted the equation p=b(1 - e-c(t-L)), because in the other exponential model a was negative. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","By-product;

One of the most interesting options is that sea buckthorn contains high concentrations of vitamin C, carotenoids, tocopherols, and other bioactive compounds, in addition to the unique lipid profile in the berry pulp, seed, and peel. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art of potential applications of sea buckthorn within the food and feed industry based on previously described applications. Products such as cheese, yoghurt or beverages already benefit from its application. Moreover, using sea buckthorn in feed products also derives into higher quality final products (e.g. meat quality, egg quality). Poultry, pig, and fish farming have been studied for that purpose.

The number of scientific papers on MG has increased in the past few years. It is, however, difficult to differentiate specifically between the MG discipline or other research areas in food science and technology. Otherwise, molecular cooking, i.e., an application of MG principles, seems limited to a few “fancy” techniques supported by famous chefs. This paper aims to critically review the recent developments of MG, the most interesting applications, and the outcomes obtained from the fruitful collaboration among food scientists and innovative chefs. The controversies and merits associated with MG are also presented, e.g., the principle of food pairing and consumers’ appreciation of innovative dishes, and a few research papers promising exciting future developments. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Cooking methods; food pairing; food processing; food science; molecular cooking; molecular gastronomy; new food products","Cooking; Food processing; Food products; Processed foods; Cooking methods; Food preparation; Food science; Food science and technology; Molecular gastronomy; Research papers; Scientific discipline; Scientific papers; cooking; human; nutritional science; scientist; Thermal processing (foods)","","","","","","","Vega C., Ubbink J., Molecular gastronomy: A food fad or science supporting innovative cuisine?

The osmotic treatment consisted on the immersion the samples into 65% (w/w) sucrose aqueous solution at 30 °C during different treatment times from 5 to 1440 min. Some physical-chemical parameters were measured in fresh, treated and reposed (24 h at 30 °C) samples. Dielectric spectra were measured in the frequency range from 500 MHz to 20 GHz by an Agilent 85070E Open-ended Coaxial Probe connected to an Agilent E8362B Vector Network Analyzer in the fresh, treated and reposed samples. It has been demonstrated that the dielectric technique is a good method to control the osmotic treatment in kiwifruit. Industrial relevance: The results of this research article are demonstrated to be useful for controlling candying of kiwifruits in bakery industries. Thus, the industrial relevance is clear in order to optimize the osmotic dehydration times and the final quantity of sugars added by using a non destructive technique that can be implemented in process line. Dielectric spectroscopy, which can be considered an emerging technology, has the advantage of being an objective and a rapid technique. For all these reasons we are sending to this journal ""Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies"" our results. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies on the remaining polyphenol oxidase activity and the oxidation of polyphenols in these beans have been conducted in relation to two factors, ie incubation time (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16h) and pH of incubation (3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5). Owing to unsuccessful polyphenol oxidation during incubation of partly fermented beans, incubation - enrichment treatments were carried out by combining incubation time (0, 8, 16, 24 and 32h) and addition of crude cocoa polyphenol oxidase and purified tyrosinase from mushroom at 88 and 8800units g-1 and pH 5.5. Results showed that the remaining polyphenol oxidase activities of unfermented and partly fermented dried beans were 1 and 0.08% with specific activities of 9 and 1% respectively. The polyphenols of unfermented beans were effectively oxidised by incubation at 45°C and pH 3.5-6.5 without enzyme enrichment; while those of partly fermented beans required enzyme enrichment.

In the first phase the internal temperature of the potatoes rose to approximately 100°C with little loss of water vapour. The uniformity of internal heating during this phase was assessed by identifying gelatinised starch. Starch gelatinisation began near the outer surface after 1.5 min of cooking and was complete by 2.5 min. During the second cooking phase the thermal energy absorbed was used to evaporate water. When immersion in boiling water was substituted for this second phase of microwave cooking, it took significantly longer for the internal texture to soften adequately for the potatoes to be considered cooked. This suggests that microwave cooking influences texture independently of the thermal profile of the cooking process. Damage by escaping steam is suggested as a mechanism. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Cell wall; Cooking; Potato; Starch; Texture; Thermal diffusion","Solanum tuberosum; food science","","","","","","","Brittin H.C., Trevino J.E., Acceptability of microwave and conventionally baked potatoes, J Food Sci, 45, pp. 1425-1427, (1980); Wilson W.D., MacKinnon I.M.R., Jarvis M.C., Transfer of heat and moisture during oven baking of potatoes, J Sci Food Agric, 82, pp. 1074-1079, (2002); Zhou L., Puri V.M., Anantheswaran R.C., Yeh G., Finite element modeling of heat and mass transfer in food materials during microwave heating - Model development and validation, J Food Engng, 21, pp. 509-529, (1995); Burfoot D., Railton C.J., Foster A.M., Reavell S.R., Modelling the pasteurisation of prepared meals with microwaves at 896 MHz, J Food Engng, 30, pp. 117-133, (1996); Vilayannur R.S., Puri V.M., Anantheswaran R.C., Size and shape effect on nonuniformity of temperature and moisture distributions in microwave heated food materials: Part I.

To test the effects of lower levels of N fertility on onion bulb flavour, 'Granex 33' onions were grown hydroponically in a greenhouse with varying solution N levels. Eleven levels were tested by increasing the concentration of NH4NO3 in solutions from 20 to 140 mg l-1 N. Mature plants were harvested and evaluated for plant leaf and bulb fresh weights (FWs), bulb soluble solids content (SSC), bulb total pyruvic acid, bulb total sulphur (S), and bulb sulphate (SO42-). To determine the effect of N on the flavour biosynthetic pathway of onions total and individual S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxides and related peptide intermediates were also tested. Leaf and bulb FWs responded quadratically to N concentration, as did total bulb S. Bulb SO42- and SSC, though significantly influenced by N concentration, did not respond with a meaningful trend. Bulb pyruvic acid increased linearly with N level increases, as did (+)-S-propyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide. Total precursors, (+)-S-methyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide, and trans-(+)-S-1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide responded quadratically to N levels. At lower N levels, trans-(+)-S-1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide content was highest relative to the other precursors. However, at elevated N levels, (+)-S-methyl-L-cysteine sulphoxide accumulated in the highest concentrations. Peptide intermediates 2-carboxypropyl glutathione and γ-glutamyl propenyl cysteine sulphoxide responded linearly and quadratically respectively to increasing N fertility levels. Nitrogen fertility levels can influence flavour intensity and quality and should be considered when growing onions for flavour attributes. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","1-propenyl cysteine sulphoxide; Allium cepa; Methyl cysteine sulphoxide; Nitrogen; Propyl cysteine sulphoxide; Pyruvic acid; Sulphate; Sulphur","Allium cepa; fertilizer application; food science","","","","","","","Lancaster J.E., Boland M.J., Flavor biochemistry, Onions and Allied Crops, 3, pp. 33-72, (1990); Freeman G.G., Mossadeghi N., Effect of sulphate nutrition on flavour components of onion (Allium cepa), J Sci Food Agric, 21, pp. 610-615, (1970); Randle W.M., Bussard M.L., Pungency and sugars of short-day onions as affected by sulfur nutrition, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 118, pp. 766-770, (1993); Randle W.M., Lancaster J.E., Shaw M.L., Sutton K.H., Hay R.L., Bussard M.L., Quantifying onion flavor compounds responding to sulfur fertility: Sulfur increases levels of alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides and biosynthetic intermediates, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 120, pp. 1075-1081, (1995); Hamilton B.K., Yoo K.S., Pike L.M., Changes in pungency of onions by soil type, sulphur nutrition and bulb maturity, Sci Hortic, 74, pp. 249-256, (1998); Anderson J.W., Sulfur metabolism in plants, The Biochemistry of Plants, a Comprehensive Treatise, 16, pp. 327-381, (1990); Brunold C., Suter M., Regulation of sulfate assimilation by nitrogen nutrition in the duckweed Lemna minor L, Plant Physiol, 76, pp. 579-583, (1984); Koprivova A., Suter M., Camp R.O.D., Brunold C., Kopriva S., Regulation of sulfate assimilation by nitrogen in Arabidopsis, Plant Physiol, 122, pp. 737-746, (2000); Brewster J.L., Butler H.A., Effects of nitrogen supply on bulb development in onion Allium cepa L, J Exp Bot, 219, pp. 1155-1162, (1989); Brown B.D., Hornbacher A.J., Naylor D.V., Sulfur-coated urea as slow-release nitrogen source for onions, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 113, pp. 864-869, (1988); Drost D., Koenig R., Tindall T., Nitrogen use efficiency and onion yield increased with a polymer-coated nitrogen source, HortScience, 37, pp. 338-342, (2002); Neeraja G., Reddy K.M., Reddy M.S., Rao V.P., Influence of irrigation and nitrogen levels on bulb yield, nutrient uptake and nitrogen use efficiencies in rabi onion (Allium cepa), Indian J Agric Sci, 71, pp. 109-112, (2001); Hussaini M.A., Amans E.B., Ramalan A.A., Yield, bulb size distribution, and storability of onion (Allium cepa L) under different levels of N fertilization and irrigation regime, Trop Agric, 77, pp. 145-149, (2000); Sypien M.J., Smoter J., Kepkowa A., Nowosielski O., The influence of nitrogen fertilization on onion quality and storage, Acta Hortic, 24, pp. 341-347, (1973); Randle W.M., Increasing nitrogen concentration in hydroponic solutions affects onion flavor and bulb quality, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 125, pp. 254-259, (2000); Wang A.D., Swiader J.M., Juvik J.A., Nitrogen and sulfur fertilization influences aromatic flavor components in shrunken 2 sweet corn kernels, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 120, pp. 771-777, (1995); Gamiely S., Randle W.M., Mills H.A., Smittle D.A., Banna G.I., Onion plant growth, bulb quality, and water uptake following ammonium and nitrate nutrition, HortScience, 26, pp. 1061-1063, (1991); Block E., The organosulfur chemistry of the genus Allium - Implications for the organic chemistry of sulfur, Angew Chem Int Ed Engl, 31, pp. 1135-1178, (1992); Boyhan G., Granberry D., Kelley T., Onion production guide, GA Agric Extension Bull, 1198, (2001); Hoagland D.R., Arnon D.I., The water culture method for growing plants without soil, Calif Agric Exp Stn Circ, 347, (1950); Randle W.M., Bussard M.L., Streamlining onion pungency analysis, HortScience, 28, (1993); Schwimmer S., Weston W.J., Enzymatic development of pyruvic acid in onion as a measure of pungency, J Agric Food Chem, 9, pp. 301-304, (1961); Yoo K.S., Pike L.M., Determination of background pyruvic acid concentrations in onions, Allium species, and other vegetables, Sci Hortic, 89, pp. 249-256, (2001); Armstrong M.D., Lewis J.D., Thioether derivatives of cysteine and homocysteine, J Org Chem, 16, pp. 749-753, (1951); Brewster J.L., Physiology of crop growth and bulbing, Onions and Allied Crops, 1, pp. 53-81, (1990); Randle W.M., Onion germplasm interacts with sulfur fertility for plant sulfur utilization and bulb pungency, Euphytica, 59, pp. 151-156, (1992); Randle W.M., Block E., Littlejohn M., Putman D., Bussard M.L., J Agric Food Chem Onion (Allium cepa L) Thiosulfinates Respond to Increasing Sulfur Fertility, 42, pp. 2085-2088, (1994); Kopsell D.A., Randle W.M., Selenium affects the S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides among short-day onion cultivars, J Am Soc Hortic Sci, 124, pp. 307-311, (1999); Randle W.M., Lancaster J.E., Sulphur compounds in alliums in relation to flavour quality, Allium Crop Science: Recent Advances, pp. 329-356, (2002)","W.M.

A total of 945 documents were analyzed. The scientific prospection showed that agricultural and biological science was the main application area. The food industry area had the highest number of filed patents. The annual evaluation of published documents demonstrated that this area had been investigated since the 1970s, and the number of articles was twice than that of filled patents. Although protein products are available for sale, animal and vegetable sources replace conventional protein products. Presently, alternative protein sources are already a worldwide trend in the food industry, enabling the development of new products to facilitate their insertion into the consumer market. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Innovation; Market trends; Scientific prospection; Technological prospection","Animals; Bibliometrics; Databases, Factual; Commerce; Patents and inventions; Data collection; Food industries; Food markets; Food science; Innovation; Market trends; Protein sources; Scientific literature; Scientific prospection; Technological prospection; biomedicine; consumer; food industry; human; patent; review; vegetable; animal; bibliometrics; factual database; Proteins","","","","","Coordination for the Training and Improvement of Higher Education Personnel; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (409924/2021-0)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to express their special gratitude to Coordination for the Training and Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES/Brazil).

It has been suggested that reducing sodium in the food supply may be the most appropriate solution. The aim of this scoping review was to establish what sodium reduction strategies are effective in maintaining acceptable sensory qualities for various food industry applications. Studies that evaluate and report on the effectiveness of a sodium reduction strategy relevant to food and included outcomes detailing how the strategies were received by human subjects using sensory data are included, as well as book chapters, literature reviews, and patents focusing on sodium reduction strategies. Only those published in English and since 1970 were included. Literature was obtained through Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOhost, and ScienceDirect databases, whereas patents were obtained through US Patent Trademark Office, Google Patents, and PATENTSCOPE databases. Two-hundred and seventy-seven primary studies, 27 literature reviews, 10 book chapters, and 143 patents were selected for inclusion. Data extracted included details such as analytical methods, broad and specific treatment categories, significant outcomes, and limitations among other material. Sodium reduction methods were categorized as either salt removal, salt replacement, flavor modification, functional modification, or physical modification. Although salt removal and salt replacement were the majority of included studies, future research would benefit from combining methods from other categories while investigating the impact on sensory characteristics, technological aspects, and consumer perception of the strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

A household corn popper adapted to control heating and airflow was used. The effects of temperatures load, airflow and moisture on the popping capacity and on the functional properties, nutritional quality, crude protein content, lysine content and sensory texture of the poppei grain were investigate. The yield, expansion volume and density of popped grain showed that the optimal conditions for the popping process were 240°C, 22 g load, 0.013 m3 s-1 airflow and 12% grain moisture. The proportion of popped grain with butterfly shape was highest (p < 0.05) at 220°C, 22 g load, 0.014m3 s-1 airflow and 14% grain moisture. The functional and physic-chemical properties of popped grain obtained by various treatments showed completely gelatinised starch. The total, available and resistant starch contents were similar among the different treatments. The enzymatic degradation of starch was 65% within 5-15min of incubation with α-amylase. The crude protein content was almost 15% for all the treatments, while the total lysine content was 45.2-48.0mg g-1 protein. The in vitro availability of protein of popped grain obtained at 0.013m3 s-1 airflow and 14% grain moisture was above 84%. The highest available lysine value was found for popped grain obtained at 0.014m3 s-1 airflow, 18-22g load and 12-14% grain moisture. However, six of the eight treatments had available lysine contents that varied between 41.2 and 47.4mg g-1 protein.

The true digestibility of both the unheated oil and of an oil heated at frying temperature (180 °C) for 50 h in the presence of air was determined by using a 4 h in viva test after applying the oil by an oesophageal probe to Wistar rats followed by high-performance exclusion chromatography analysis of the luminal remaining fat. The true digestibility coefficient of the heated oil did not change significantly with respect to the unheated oil, although it tended to decrease (p < 0.1; 38%). The true digestibility of polymers, dimers, and total oligomers was 30%, 59%, and 38% respectively, whereas those of the unheated oil was much higher (95%, 90%, and 91% respectively). True digestibility did not change for the triacylglycerol monomers. The plasma concentration of triacylglycerol tended to decrease (9.7%; p > 0.05) in the rats receiving the heated oil, suggesting some delay in the absorption mechanism. Data show that thermoxidized compounds from abused oil are poorly but actively hydrolysed and absorbed in viva. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Frying oil; HPSEC; In vivo digestibility; Oligomers; Polymers; Sunflower oil; Thermal oxidation; Triacylglycerols","Helianthus; Rattus norvegicus; digestibility; food science; vegetable oil","","","","","","","Romero A., Cuesta C., Sanchez-Muniz F.J., Cyclic fatty acid monomers and thermoxidative alteration compounds formed during frying of frozen foods in extra virgin olive oil, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 77, pp. 1169-1175, (2000); Romero A., Sanchez-Muniz F.J., Cuesta C., Deep fat frying of frozen foods in sunflower oil.

The fruits were peeled, sliced to a thickness of 2 mm and deep-fat fried in refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein at 180±5°C for 3 min. The quality parameters determined for fresh bananas were total soluble solids, pH, acidity, carbohydrate, sugar content, fat, protein, moisture content, ash, fibre, colour and fruit firmness. The results showed that Abu had a higher carbohydrate content than Nangka at both stages of ripeness before frying. No sucrose was detected in Nangka. The quality parameters determined after deep-fat frying were moisture content, water activity, oil absorption, crispness and sensory evaluation. The moisture content and water activity of Abu chips were lower than those of Nangka chips. The texture of chips prepared from Abu at stage 'green' showed more crispness than the other three samples. Sensory evaluation showed that chips prepared from Abu at both stages of ripeness presented better colour, flavour, odour, texture and overall acceptability than those prepared from Nangka. Based on the matrix of correlation coefficients, fresh bananas with higher fruit firmness and carbohydrate content gave banana chips with higher crispness and oil absorption. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Banana chips; Deep-fat frying; Pisang Abu; Pisang Nangka; Ripening stage; Sensory evaluation","banana; chemical and physical properties; cultivar; food processing; food quality; frying; organoleptic property; ripening; sensory analysis; temperature; thickness; triolein; food science","","","","","","","Nakasone H.Y., Paul R.E., Banana, Tropical Fruits, pp. 103-131, (1998); Lizada M.C.C., Pantastico E.B., Abd Shukor A.R., Sabari S.D., Ripening of banana, Banana, pp. 65-103, (1990); Samson J., Banana and plantain, Tropical Fruit, pp. 119-161, (1980); Stoven R.H., Simmonds N.W., The Eumasa series of cultivar, Bananas, pp. 113-171, (1987); Warner K., Orr P., Glynn M., Effect due to changes in fat during heating, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 74, pp. 711-717, (1997); Che Man Y.B., Wan Hussin W.R., Comparison of the frying performance of refined, bleached and deodorised palm olein anal coconut oil, J Food Lipids, 5, pp. 197-210, (1998); Orthoefer F.T., Cooper D.S., Initial quality of frying oil, Deep Frying Chemistry, Nutrition, and Practical Applications, pp. 29-42, (1996); Jackson J.C., Bourne M.C., Barnard J., Optimization of blanching for crispness of banana chips using response surface methodology, J Food Sci, 6, pp. 165-166, (1996); Noor N., Augustin M.A., Effectiveness of antioxidants on the stability of banana chip, J Sci Food Agric, 35, pp. 805-812, (1984); Marriott J., Banana - Physiology and biochemistry of storage and ripening for optimum quality, CRC Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 13, pp. 41-88, (1980); Nair C.K.V., Seow C.C., Sulebele G.A., Effects of frying parameters on physical changes of tapioca chips during deep-fat frying, J Food Sci, 31, pp. 249-256, (1996); Official Methods of Analysis, 14th edn., (1984); Ranganna S., Manual of Analysis of Fruit and Vegetable Products, pp. 1-20, (1977); Hunt R.S., Jackson P.A., Mortlock R.E., Kirk R.S., Quantitative determination of sugar in foodstuffs by high performance liquid chromatography, Analyst, 102, pp. 917-920, (1977); Stone H., Sidel J.L., Measurement, Sensory Evaluation Practices, 2nd edn., pp. 66-95, (1993); Statistic Analysis System User's Guide: Statistics, pp. 125-154, (1989); Matsumoto S., Obara T., Luh B., Changes in chemical constituents of kiwifruit during postharvest ripening, J Food Sci, 48, pp. 607-611, (1983); Sole P., Bananas (processed), Processing Fruits: Science and Technology, Volume 2, Major Processed Products, 2, pp. 361-385, (1989); Abdullah H., Zaipun M.Z., Rohaya M.A., Maturity indices of banana (Musa sapientum CV.

Currently, interdisciplinary research has expanded molecular simulation technology from computer aided drug design (CADD) to food science. More food scientists are supporting their hypotheses/results with this technology. To understand better the use of molecular simulation methods, it is necessary to systematically summarize the latest applications and usage trends of molecular simulation methods in the research field of food science. However, this type of review article is rare. To bridge this gap, we have comprehensively summarized the principle, combination usage, and application of molecular simulation methods in food science. We also analyzed the limitations and future trends and offered valuable strategies with the latest technologies to help food scientists use molecular simulation methods.  © 2023 American Chemical Society.","food science; machine learning; molecular docking; molecular dynamics simulation; quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR); quantum chemical calculation","Drug Design; Food Technology; Molecular Docking Simulation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Computational chemistry; Machine learning; Molecular graphics; Molecular modeling; Molecular structure; Quantum chemistry; Dynamics simulation; Food science; Machine-learning; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamic simulation; Molecular simulations; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Quantitative structure−activity relationship; Quantum chemical calculations; Quantum-chemical calculation; drug design; food handling; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; quantitative structure activity relation; Molecular dynamics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31571782, 31771975, 32172196)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 32172196, 31771975 and 31571782.

Exogenous proteolytic enzymes were used to accelerate the elaboration process, and various fermentation technological parameters (salt percentage, temperature, enzyme dose, continuous stirring) were assayed in order to optimise the process and obtain the best yield. Best conditions were 10% salt (5% added at the start of the process and the 5% after 24 h of fermentation), 35-37°C and Neutrase (an endoprotease from Bacillus subtilis) at 0.125 Anson Units per 100g. The fermentation process was carried out in 48h. The obtained product (filtered and diluted with a guar gum solution) was a thick sauce with 21 mgNg-1, 5.9% salt and 10% fat. The lipidic fraction showed a very interesting fatty acid profile, especially in relation to its ω-3 fatty acids (PUFA/SFA ratio 0.98; 4.2 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 11.3 g docosahexaenoic acid per 100 g fat). The developed garum was rather different from fish sauces that are manufactured nowadays in South East Asian countries. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","Accelerated process; Exogenous enzymes; Garum; Low salt concentration","Bacillus subtilis; Cyamopsis tetragonoloba; Roman; Scomber scombrus; Scombridae gen. sp.; Thynnus; food science","","","","","","","Sanceda N.G., Kurata T., Arakawa N., Overall quality and sensory acceptance of a lysine fortified fish sauce, J Food Sci, 55, pp. 983-988, (1990); Yoshinaka R., Sato M., Tsuchiya N., Ikeda S., Production of fish sauce from sardine by utilization of its visceral enzymes, Bull Jpn Soc Sci Fish, 49, pp. 463-469, (1983); Kim S.M., Ha J.U., Utilization of the protein hydrolysates of skipjack tuna viscera, Kor J Food Sci Technol, 27, pp. 141-146, (1995); Lee S.C., Woo K.L., A study on development of effective utilization method of skipjack tuna viscera, Kor J Food Sci Technol, 24, pp. 86-91, (1992); Beddows C.G., Ismail M., Steinkraus K.H., The use of bromelain in the hydrolysis of mackerel and the investigation of fermented fish aroma, J Food Technol, 11, pp. 379-388, (1976); Beddows C.G., Ardeshir A.G., The production of soluble fish protein solution for use in fish sauce manufacture.

Driven by the immense functional and nutritional implications of starch-lipid binary interactions, this study is aimed at designing starch digestibility by controlling the interaction between starch and glycerol monostearate (GMS)/stearic acid (SA) using a hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) environment. The results indicated that the thermal shear force in the HE-3DP environment promoted hydrophobic interactions between starch and lipids, forming a V-type starch-lipid complex with a compact and ordered structure, thus enhancing enzymatic resistance. Compared with GMS, SA with linear hydrophobic chains was inclined to compound with starch to form a more ordered structure. Interestingly, the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) content reached 25.06% when the added SA content was 10%. Besides, correlations between the structural parameters and digestibility were established, which provided crucial information for designing nutritional starchy food systems using HE-3DP. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Hot Temperature; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Resistant Starch; Starch; 3D printers; Extrusion; Hydrophobicity; starch; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Food science; Glycerol monostearate; Hot extrusion; Hotspots; Ordered structures; Starch digestibilities; Starch lipid; Starchy foods; chemistry; heat; three dimensional printing; Starch","","starch, 9005-25-8, 9005-84-9; Resistant Starch, ; Starch, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31871751, 32101982); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M691069); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This research has been financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32101982, 31871751), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M691069).","Kewuyemi Y.O., Kesa H., Adebo O.A., Trends in functional food development with three-dimensional (3D) food printing technology: prospects for value-added traditionally processed food products, Crit.

Cattle slurry and cattle deep litter were each applied to sandy soil in three ways. The type of manure applied gave the most distinct effect on sensory quality. Manuring with slurry decreased dry matter, starch and phytic acid and increased N and rheological properties (modulus of deformability, stress, strain) significantly compared with deep litter manuring. Maturity of tubers was assumed to be the main cause of these differences. Regarding the sensory quality of potatoes, minor differences were found among the organic treatments investigated. Potatoes manured with slurry were slightly moister and seemed to have higher discolouration and off-odour and lower yellowness than potatoes manured with deep litter. Mealiness was highest when composted deep litter was ploughed in and lowest when deep litter and straw were ploughed in. The observed differences in sensory quality are presumably an effect of availability of N in the manure. Chlorogenic acid was the only phenolic acid that was affected by the organic treatments. The variation in phenolic acid and scopoletin contents did not seem to influence the off-taste of potatoes. As the sensory quality of potatoes produced by different organic treatments had not been addressed previously, this study revealed interesting results. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.","K; Manure; N; Organic farming; Potatoes; Rheology; Sensory quality","Bos taurus; Solanum tuberosum; food quality; food science","","","","","","","Stopes C., Woodward L., Forde G., Vogtmann H., The nitrate content of vegetable and salad crops offered to the consumer as from 'organic' or 'conventional' production systems, Biol Agric Hort, 5, pp. 215-221, (1988); Stein-Bachinger K., Werner W., Effect of manure on crop yield and quality in an organic agricultural system, Biol Agric Hort, 14, pp. 221-235, (1997); Varis E., Pietila L., Koikkalainen K., Comparison of conventional, integrated and organic potato production in field experiments in Finland, Acta Agric Scand B, 46, pp. 41-48, (1996); Woese K., Lange D., Boess C., Bogl K.W., A comparison of organically and conventionally grown foods - Results of a review of the relevant literature, J Sci Food Agric, 74, pp. 281-293, (1997); Matheis G., Polyphenol oxidase and enzymatic browning of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum).

Here it is demonstrated that in combination with spectral simulation, this technique can provide information on local concentration, conformation and orientation of different constituents simultaneously. Furthermore, dynamics of, e.g. protein accumulation and unfolding at the interface, can be studied on-line. Molecular properties can be measured together with system parameters, such as surface pressure, pH and ionic strength, and as a function of process, like expansion or compression the surface. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","","absorption spectroscopy; food analysis; food biotechnology; infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy; molecular analysis; online analysis; simulation; Absorption spectroscopy; Infrared radiation; Ionic strength; pH effects; Food science; Food products","","","","","","","Atkinson P.J., Dickinson E., Horne D.S., Richardson R.M., Neutron reflectivity of adsorbed β-casein and β-lactoglobulin at the air/water interface, J.

However, a nutrition transition is underway, characterized by shifts away from traditional diets in favour of imported and modern foods, contributing to some of the highest rates of obesity and Diabetes Type 2 Mellitus in the world. Using a mixed method approach, this study aimed to assess dietary agrobiodiversity’s relationship with nutrition indicators related to diet quality and anthropometrics within the context of the rural and Indigenous food system of Baniata village, located in the Western Province of Solomon Islands (Melanesia). A secondary aim was to evaluate the contribution of agrobiodiversity from the local food system to diet quality. A comprehensive nutrition survey was administered to the women primarily responsible for cooking of randomly selected households (n = 30). Additionally, 14 participatory focus group discussions captured the historical narrative of food system transitions, were hosted over a period of seven days, and included men, women and youth. Dietary intakes of the participants were reported below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for several essential nutrients, including protein (53%), calcium (96.6%), vitamin B1 (86.6%), vitamin B2 (80%), vitamin A (80%), zinc (40%) and fibre (77%). Focus group participants built a timeline of key historical and climatic transitions perceived to be drivers of dietary shifts away from traditional foods and towards imported and processed foods. Participants identified 221 species and varieties of agrobiodiverse foods available for cultivation or wild collection. Based on 24 h diet recalls, 87 were found to be utilised. Participants who consumed foods of a wider diversity of species richness had a higher probability of achieving recommended nutrition intakes and a lower body fat percentage (r2 = 0.205; p = 0.012). Our results suggest a nutrition transition is underway, and strategies harnessing traditional knowledge of nutrient-dense, agrobiodiverse foods can help improve food and nutrition security. © 2021, The Author(s).","Diet quality; Food security; Melanesia; Pacific Islands; Sustainable diets; Wild foods","Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; developing world; diabetes; dietary intake; food science; indigenous population; nutrition; obesity; small island state; traditional knowledge","","","","","Carol Offer, Joe Hagabore; Food and Agriculture Organization; United Nations, Agriculture for Nutrition and Health; Massey University","This research would not be possible without the hospitality and participation from the Indigenous villagers from Baniata.

There is an expectation about the use in chronic disease of the Attalea phalerata oil since its composition is high in carotenoids and beneficial fatty acids. The aim of the study was to evaluate the toxicological profile of the oil extracted from Attalea phalerata Mart. ex Spreng. pulp (APO). Acute and subacute toxicity studies were performed in male and female Wistar rats according to the OECD - Guidelines 425 and 407. For the acute toxicity, one single dose of the APO (2000 mg/kg) was administered by gavage to five female rats. In the subacute toxicity, four different doses (125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) of the APO were administered to male and female rats for 28 consecutive days. No deaths or behavioral changes were observed during both experiments as well as no changes in organ weights, hematological, histopathological parameters. The biochemical parameters showed changes in phosphatase alkaline and albumin levels, however these values are within the normal range for the species. A significant reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides was also observed in some of the animals treated with the APO. Therefore, the LD50 is higher than 2000 mg/kg and the APO oil can be considered safe at the doses tested in rats. However, further assessments are required in order to proceed to clinical studies in humans. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attalea phalerata Mart.; Bacuri; Bioactive compounds; Carotenoids; Fatty acids; Food science; Toxicology","Administration, Oral; Animals; Arecaceae; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Fruit; Lethal Dose 50; Male; Plant Oils; Rats, Wistar; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Toxicity Tests, Subacute; Alkalinity; Fatty acids; Medicine; Oils and fats; Pigments; Rats; vegetable oil; Attalea phalerata Mart; Bacuri; Bioactive compounds; Carotenoids; Food science; Toxicology; animal; Arecaceae; chemistry; dose response; female; fruit; isolation and purification; LD50; male; oral drug administration; risk assessment; time factor; toxicity; toxicity testing; Wistar rat; Toxicity","","Plant Oils, ","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul, FUNDECT","To the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for the scholarship assistance, to the Fundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul ( FUNDECT ), to the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico ( CNPq ), to the University Center of Grande Dourados ( UNIGRAN ) for the support and Dr. Ghazal Nabil Edavile for providing language help.","ANVISA - Agencia Nacional De Vigilancia Sanitaria, Guia para a condução de estudos não clínicos de toxicologia e segurança farmacológica necessários ao desenvolvimento de medicamentos.

This technique is used in sociology and psychology studies; however, in the Consumer and Food Science area has gained importance since it allows to explore beliefs, expectations, or attitudes in the context of food consumption behavior. The aim of this work is to present a current status on the use of this technique in the studies of food consumption behavior. A narrative review of the literature was carried out with articles published in four databases: ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Emerald Insight, and Taylor & Francis. Seventy-four articles that show the use of the WA technique in different cultures were selected. WA technique has been applied in different countries, however, it has been primarily used in Latin America. WA has been applied mainly to decipher consumers' perceptions towards different aspects of food, although some works show that WA serves to understand beliefs, expectations, impressions, attitudes, and even to conceptualize different categories of food from the language of consumers. Some theoretical and methodological implications are discussed regarding the use and application of this projective technique. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Food consumer behavior; Narrative review; Projective techniques; Word association","Attitude; Consumer Behavior; Food; Food Preferences; Projective Techniques; Consumer behavior; Digital libraries; Consumer perception; Current status; Food consumer behavior; Food consumption; Food science; Latin America; Narrative review; Projective technique; Spontaneous generation; Word-association; attitude; consumer attitude; food; food preference; projective personality test; psychology; Food supply","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","To the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología - CONACYT) for the scholarship granted to author E.

The goal of this study was to develop a plasmid-based reporter system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to facilitate the study of C. jejuni in a variety of niches. C. jejuni transformants harboring the pMEK91 GFP gene (gfp)-containing vector were readily detectable by both fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Given the ease of detecting these organisms, additional experiments were performed in which BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with C. jejuni harboring the gfp-containing vector. Four hours after injection of the mice, flow cytometry analyses determined that C. jejuni synthesizing GFP were predominantly associated with granulocytes. More specifically, the proportion of CD11b+ Gr-1+ lavage neutrophils with green fluorescence ranged from 99.7 to 100%, while the proportion of CD11b+ Gr-1- lavage macrophages ranged from 77.0 to 80.0%. In contrast, few CD11b- CD45R+ B lymphocytes from the lavage of the C. jejuni-injected mice were associated with greenfluorescent C. jejuni (proportions ranged from 0.75 to 0.77%). Cell-free C. jejuni was recovered from tissue homogenates after intraperitoneal injection. Macrorestriction profiling with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a genotypic variant of the C. jejuni F38011 wild-type isolate. In vivo this variant displayed a phenotype identical to that of the wild-type isolate. In summary, we demonstrate that C. jejuni associates with marker-defined cellular subsets in vivo with a novel gfp reporter system and that C. jejuni genotypic variants can be isolated from both in vitro and in vivo systems.","","Animals; Base Sequence; Campylobacter Infections; Campylobacter jejuni; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Female; Flow Cytometry; Food Poisoning; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Vectors; Granulocytes; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Luminescent Proteins; Macrophages, Peritoneal; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Neutrophils; Plasmids; Recombinant Proteins; Variation (Genetics); Virulence; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Campylobacter jejuni; Fluorescence; Microscopic examination; Synthesis (chemical); Tissue; biological marker; CD11b antigen; CD45 antigen; green fluorescent protein; plasmid vector; recombinant protein; detection method; flow cytometry; fluorescence; food science; microbiology; microscopy; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; B lymphocyte; bacterial strain; bacterium detection; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; bacterium transformation; Campylobacter jejuni; cell free system; cell specificity; cell subpopulation; controlled study; experimental infection; female; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; genotype; granulocyte; homogenate; host pathogen interaction; in vitro study; in vivo study; macrophage; microbiological examination; mouse; mouse strain; neutrophil; nonhuman; peritoneum lavage; phenotype; protein determination; protein expression; protein synthesis; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; reporter gene; wild type; Flow cytometry; Proteins","","DNA, Bacterial, ; Green Fluorescent Proteins, 147336-22-9; Luminescent Proteins, ; Recombinant Proteins, ","","","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK, (R01DK058911)","","Alm R.A., Guerry P., Trust T.J., The Campylobacter σ<sup>54</sup> flaB flagellin promoter is subject to environmental regulation, J.

The purpose of this research was to investigate the use of crab-processing by-product (CB) in the development of a calcium-rich expanded snack. The specific objectives were to examine the effects of type of CB (wet or dry), feed composition and screw speed (150 or 250 rpm) on selected properties of extruded snacks. Product formulations consisting of 0-400 g kg-1 CB combined with corn meal and potato flakes were processed in a twin-screw extruder. The resulting extrudates were analysed for proximate and mineral (calcium, sodium) composition, pH, water activity (aw), total plate count, bulk density, expansion ratio and colour. Both CB type and level of incorporation had significant effects (P < 0.05) on the calcium content, expansion ratio, bulk density and pH of the extrudates. Increasing the CB level resulted in increased calcium content (from 5.1 to 52.4 mg g -1) and pH (from 6.1 to 8.8). Screw speed had no significant effects (P > 0.05) on expansion ratio and bulk density. A high processing temperature (157°C) and low aw resulted in undetectable microbial growth on the extrudates. This research demonstrates that ground crab-processing by-product can be successfully incorporated into an expanded snack product. Further research will evaluate consumer response to this novel value-added product. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","By-product utilisation; Crab processing; Extrusion; Snack food","Decapoda (Crustacea); Solanum tuberosum; Zea mays; food science","","","","","","","Gates K.W., Parker A.H., Characterization of minced meat extracted from blue crab picking plant by-products, J Food Sci, 57, pp. 267-270, (1992); Meyers S.P., Development and trends in fisheries processing: Value-added product development and total resource utilization, Bull Korean Fish Soc, 27, pp. 839-846, (1994); Maga J.A., Reddy T., Co-extrusion of carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rice flour, J Food Process Preserv, 9, pp. 121-128, (1985); Quaglia G.B., Paoletti F., Garofalo G., Menesatti P., Cappelloni M., Maurizi A., Latini A., Use of sardine mince in cereal blends to obtain extruded products, Ital J Food Sci, 4, pp. 23-28, (1989); Kristensen K.H., Gry P., Holm F., Extruded protein-rich animal by-products with improved texture, Thermal Processing and Quality of Foods, pp. 113-121, (1984); Clayton J.T., Miscourides D.N., Extruder texturized foods from underutilized fish tissue, J Aquat Food Prod Technol, 3-4, pp. 65-89, (1992); Choudhury G.S., Application of extrusion technology to process fish muscle, Nutrition and Utilization Technology in Aquaculture, pp. 233-245, (1995); Gogoi B.K., Oswalt A.J., Choudhury G.S., Reverse screw elements and feed composition effects during twin-screw extrusion of rice flour and fish muscle blends, J Food Sci, 61, pp. 590-595, (1996); Suknark K., McWatters K.H., Phillips R.D., Acceptance by American and Asian consumers of extruded fish and peanut snack products, J Food Sci, 63, pp. 721-725, (1998); Suknark K., Phillips R.D., Huang Y.W., Tapioca-fish and tapioca-peanut snacks by twin-screw extrusion and deep-fat frying, J Food Sci, 64, pp. 303-308, (1999); Bhattacharya S., Das H., Bose A.N., Rheological behavior during extrusion of blends of minced fish and wheat flour, J Food Eng, 15, pp. 123-137, (1992); Giri S.K., Bandyopadhyay S., Effect of extrusion variables on extrudate characteristics of fish muscle-rice flour blend in a single-screw extruder, J Food Process Preserv, 24, pp. 177-190, (2000); Official Methods of Analysis, 16th Edn., (1998); Bacteriological Analytical Manual, 7th Edn., (1992); Zar J.H., Biostatistical Analysis, 4th Edn., (1998); Takamine K., Bhatnagar S., Hanna M.A., Effect of eggshell on properties of corn starch extrudates, Cereal Chem, 72, pp. 385-388, (1995); Camire M.E., Camire A., Krumhar K., Chemical and nutritional changes in foods during extrusion, Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr, 29, pp. 35-57, (1990); Weaver C.M., Calcium in food fortification strategies, Int Dairy J, 8, pp. 443-449, (1998); Ranhotra G.S., Gelroth J.A., Leinen S.D., Utilization of calcium in breads highly fortified with calcium as calcium carbonate or as dairy calcium, Cereal Chem, 77, pp. 293-296, (2000)","D.I.

Single samples of each variety were used in the study. Samples as received were initially examined for mycoflora and toxin levels and then stored at 98% relative humidity and 30°C for 14 days to investigate the effects of possible adverse storage conditions on mycoflora and, in particular, aflatoxin formation. All samples showed an absence ofafiatoxins and their precusor, sterigmatocystin, after adverse storage for 14 days, although aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus isolates were identified in 10 varieties at the first stage of maturation (Kimri).

However, this characteristic deteriorates rapidly during dry storage. In the present study we have developed an indirect method to examine the freshness office grains harvested in different crop seasons or stored under conditions known to accelerate deterioration. Bulk samples of intact brown rice grains were soaked in dianisidine solution containing guaiacol and H2O 2, and the optical absorbance of the incubation solution was determined colorimetrically. Alternatively, intact brown rice grains were incubated in a similar solution in the wells of a 96-well microplate, with one grain per well, and the optical absorbance of the incubation solution was measured by a microplate reader. The results indicated that cultivar, storage duration and temperature significantly affected the activities of grain peroxidase. Marked differences in the development of purple colour in the incubation solutions and in vitro peroxidase activity were also found among the brown rice grains sampled in different seasons. The changes in colour of the incubation solutions measured by either of the above methods paralleled the changes in grain activity of peroxidase assayed using an in vitro method. The proposed method can differentiate brown rice grains harvested in different seasons. Moreover, this method, if combined with suitable statistical clustering procedures, can detect the blending status of fresh/old brown grains in a sample. The advantages of this test method using A385 over the conventional enzyme activity assay are the rapidity and simplicity with which A385 can estimate the in vitro determination of peroxidase activity of tested rice grains. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Colour reaction; Freshness; Peroxidase; Rice grain; Storage","color; food science; rice","","","","","","","Zhou Z., Robards K., Helliwell S., Blanchard C., Ageing of stored rice: Changes in chemical and physical attributes, J Cereal Sci, 35, pp. 65-78, (2002); Chrastil J., Chemical and physicochemical changes of rice during storage at different temperatures, J Cereal Sci, 11, pp. 71-85, (1990); Matsue Y., Mizuta K., Yoshida T., Varietal difference in palatability of stored rice, Japan J Crop Sci, 60, pp. 537-542, (1991); Dhaliwal Y.S., Sekhon K.S., Nagi H.P.S., Enzymatic activities and theological properties of stored rice, Cereal Chem, 68, pp. 18-21, (1991); Nandi S., Sen-Mandi S., Sinha T.P., Active oxygen and their scavengers in rice seeds (Oryza sativa cv IET 4094) aged under tropical environmental conditions, Seed Sci Res, 7, pp. 253-259, (1997); Suzuki Y., Ise K., Li C.Y., Honda I., Iwai Y., Matsukura U., Volatile components in stored rice (Oryza sativa (L)) of varieties with and without lipoxygenase- 3 in seeds, J Agric Food Chem, 47, pp. 1119-1124, (1999); Ohita H., Aibara S., Yamashita H., Sekiyama F., Morita Y., Post-harvest drying of fresh rice grain and its effects on deterioration of lipid during storage, Agric Biol Chem, 54, pp. 1157-1164, (1990); Sung J.M., Chiu K.Y., Solid matrix priming can partially reverse the deterioration of sweet corn seeds induced by 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride generated free radicals, Seed Sci Technol, 29, pp. 287-298, (2001); Chrastil J., Influence of storage on enzymes in rice grains, J Agric Food Chem, 38, pp. 1198-1202, (1990); Hendry G.A.F., Oxygen, free radical processes and seed longevity, Seed Sci Res, 3, pp. 141-153, (1993); Bernal-Lugo I., Leopold A.C., The dynamics of seed mortality, J Exp Bot, 49, pp. 1455-1461, (1998); MacAdam J.W., Nelson C.J., Sharp R.E., Peroxidase activity in the leaf elongation zone of tall fescue, Plant Physiol, 99, pp. 872-878, (1992); Medina M.I., Quesada M.A., Pliego F., Botella M.A., Valpuesta V., Expression of tomato peroxidase gene TPX1 in NaCl-adapted and unadapted suspension cells, Plant Cell Rep, 18, pp. 680-683, (1999); SAS/STAT® Users Guide, Version 8, (1999); Montgomery D.C., Design and Analysis of Experiments, 2nd Edn., pp. 399-443, (1984); Chiu K.Y., Chen C.L., Sung J.M., Effect of priming temperature on storability of primed sh-2 sweet corn seeds, Crop Sci, 42, pp. 1996-2003, (2002)","C.L.

In this study, experts in different areas along supply chains co-operated in an interactive process to define future environmentally sustainable supply chains of milk and beef. The basis was to use existing techniques, to have production performance corresponding to the best quartile of today and to consider other sustainability aspects, such as economics. The work resulted in concrete descriptions of alternative product chains for delivered milk and beef. To also permit concrete descriptions of the latter part of the product chains, two consumer-packed end products were selected for monitoring, namely fresh milk and sirloin steak. The production systems investigated comprised cropping, livestock production, industrial processing and production, logistics, packaging and wastage and distribution, but not retailers or consumers. The study area was a Swedish county and the reference level was its production of milk and beef in 2012. The future product chains were assumed to deliver the same amounts of commodities as in 2012, but with reduced environmental impact. Primary production was required to be at least as profitable as today. Beside description of the current situation, three alternative scenarios were created, focusing on delivery of ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation and minimising climate impact, respectively. Life cycle assessments were performed for these four scenarios (reference plus three alternative scenarios) for single-product chains and county-wide. Furthermore, production costs in primary production were calculated for the four scenarios. The results revealed great potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of Swedish dairy and beef production at current volumes, irrespective of whether ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation or climate impact is in focus. The single most important factor for decreased environmental impact for livestock production was increased production efficiency. Measures in agriculture, especially concerning feeds, were critical, but actions in processing and distribution also contributed. All alternative scenarios resulted in lower production costs than at present. It was obvious that as dairy and beef systems are connected, the potential for their environmental improvement must be analysed together. In conclusion, increased efficiency can decrease the negative environmental impact of Swedish cattle production and also reduce costs to the farmer. © 2017 The Authors","Beef; Cattle; Food system scenarios; LCA; Milk; Sustainable food chains","Sweden; Bos; alternative agriculture; cattle; cost analysis; dairy farming; ecosystem service; environmental impact assessment; food science; life cycle analysis; milk production; production system; supply chain management","","","","","Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research, (2011-03764); Swedish Food Federation; Västra Götalandsregionen; VINNOVA; Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas","VINNOVA, Formas, the Swedish Food Federation, Svensk Dagligvaruhandel (Swedish Perishable Retailers), the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research (all by TvärLivs) (2011-03764) and Region Västra Götaland are acknowledged for financial support.

Researchers from field of public health (PH) have attributed this problem to food processing and have created new food classification systems to support their thesis. These classifications conceptually differ from processing level concepts in food science, and state to people that food processing is directly related to nutritional impact of food. Our work aims to compare the concept of food processing from the standpoint of food science and technology (FST) and public health and to discuss differences related to formulation or level of processing of products and their impact on nutritional quality. There is a misconception between food processing/unit operation/food technology and formulation or recipes. For the public health approach, classification is based on food products selection and the use of ingredients that results in higher consumption of sugar, sodium, fat, and additives, whereas in FST, processing level is based on the intensity and amount of unit operations to enhance shelf life, food safety, food quality, and availability of edible parts of raw materials. Nutritional quality of a product or preparation is associated with formulation/recipe and not with the level of processing, with few exceptions. The impact of these recommendations on the actual comprehension of food processing and quality must be considered by the population. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","food classification; food processing; formulation; Industrialized food; nutritional quality","Food Handling; Food Technology; Humans; Nutritive Value; Obesity; Public Health; Developing countries; Food processing; Food products; Food safety; Health; Public health; Chronic disease; Classification system; Food quality; Food science; Food science and technology; formulation; Nutritional qualities; Shelf life; food handling; human; nutritional value; obesity; public health; Processed foods","","","","","","","Akutsu R.C., Botelho R.A., Camargo E.B., Savio K.E.O., Araujo W.M.C., A ficha técnica de preparação como instrumento de qualidade na produção de refeições, Revista de Nutrição., 18, 2, pp. 277-279, (2005); Barham P., The science of cooking, (2000); Batista K.A., Prudencio S.H., Fernandes K.F., Changes in the biochemical and functional properties of the extruded hard-to-cook cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.

Four frying systems were used: RBD palm olein without antioxidant (system 1); RBD palm olein with 0.2 g kg-1 α-tocopherol (system 2); RBD palm olein with 1 g kg-1 oleoresin rosemary (system 3); and RBD palm olein with the combination of 0.1 g kg-1 α-tocopherol + 0.5 g kg-1 oleoresin rosemary (system 4). Fried oil samples were analysed for fatty acid composition, peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AnV), totox value, free fatty acids (FFA) value, iodine value, E1 cm1% at 232 and 268 nm, colour and viscosity. The crispness and sensory evaluation of the banana chips fried in this study were also evaluated. The results showed that RBD palm olein with added antioxidant reduced PV, AnV, totox value, E1 cm1% at 232 and 268 nm, FFA and viscosity. The order of effectiveness in inhibiting oil oxidation in RBD palm olein was: oleoresin rosemary > α tocopherol + oleoresin rosemary > α-tocopherol > control. For the crispness, the force values of banana chips fried in all systems were comparable. Sensory evaluation of fried banana chips for each system showed that there was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in terms of colour, flavour, odour, texture and overall acceptability. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","α-tocopherol; Antioxidant; Banana chips; Deep-fat frying; Oleoresin rosemary; RBD palm olein; Sensory evaluation","Rosmarinus officinalis; food processing; food science","","","","","","","Che Man Y.B., Tan C.P., Effect of natural and synthetic antioxidants on changes in RBD palm olein during deep fat frying of potato chips, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 76, pp. 331-339, (1999); Murphy A., Kerry J.P., Buckley J., Gray J., The antioxidative properties of rosemary oleoresin and inhibition of off-flavours in precooked roast beef slices, J Sci Food Agric, 77, pp. 235-243, (1998); Frankel E.N., Huang S.W., Aeschbach R., Prior E., Antioxidant activity of a rosemary extract and its constituents, carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosmarinic acid, in bulk oil and oil-in-water emulsion, J Agric Food Chem, 44, pp. 131-135, (1996); Chrysam M., Current research in natural food antioxidants, Food Technol, 5, pp. 679-688, (1994); Cuvelier M., Berset C., Richard H., Antioxidant constituent in sage (Salvia officinalis), J Agric Food Chem, 42, pp. 665-669, (1994); Asghar A., Gray J.I., Miller E.R., Kup K., Booren A.M., Buckley D.J., Influence of supranutritional vitamin E supplementation in the feed on swine growth performance and deposition in different tissues, J Sci Food Agric, 57, pp. 19-29, (1991); Michael H., Kourimsha G., Kourimska L., Effect of antioxidants on losses of tocopherols during deep-fat frying, Food Chem, 52, pp. 175-177, (1995); Fang X., Wada S., Enhancing the antioxidant effect of α-tocopherol with rosemary in inhibiting catalysed oxidation cause by Fe<sup>2+</sup> and hemoprotein, Food Res Int, 26, pp. 405-411, (1993); Gordon M.H., Magos P., The effect of sterols on oxidation of edible oils, Food Chem, 10, pp. 141-147, (1984); Che Man Y.B., Jailong L., The effects of TBHQ and α-tocopherol on quality characteristics of refined-bleached and deodorized palm olein (RBDPO) during deep-fat frying, J Food Lipid, 6, pp. 117-129, (1999); Wada S., Fang X., The synergistic antioxidant effect of rosemary extract and α-tocopherol in sardine oil model system and frozen crushed fish meat, J Food Process Preserv, 16, pp. 263-274, (1992); Ammawath W., Che Man Y.B., Yusof S., Rahman R.A., Effects of variety and stage of fruit ripeness on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of deep-fat-fried banana chips, J Sci Food Agric, 81, pp. 1166-1171, (2001); Ammawath W., Che Man Y.B., Yusof S., Rahman R.A., Effect of pretreatment methods on the quality of banana chips and oils during deep fat frying, Eur J Lipid Sci; PORIM Test Methods, (1995); Anna V.A., Sensory test methods, Consumer Sensory Testing for Product Development, pp. 9-42, (1998); Statistic Analysis System User's Guide: Statistics, pp. 125-154, (1989); Orthoefer F.T., Cooper D.S., Evaluation of used frying oil, Deep Frying Chemistry, Nutrition, and Practical Applications, pp. 285-310, (1996); Warner K., Evaluation of lipid quality and stability, Food Lipids and Health, pp. 345-369, (1996); Che Man Y.B., Wan Hussin W.R., Comparison of the frying performance of refined, bleached and deodorised palm olein and coconut oil, J Food Lipid, 5, pp. 197-210, (1998); Rossell J.B., Measurement of rancidity, Rancidity in Foods, 2nd Edn, pp. 22-53, (1994); Rossell J.B., Classical analysis of oils and fats, Analysis of Oils and Fats, pp. 1-90, (1986); Coppen P.P., The use of antioxidants, Rancidity in Foods, 2nd Edn, pp. 84-103, (1994); Irwandi J., Che Man Y.B., Effect of rosemary and sage extract on frying performance of RBD palm olein during deep fat frying, Food Chem, 69, pp. 301-308, (2000); Lawson H., Physical properties, Food Oil and Fats: Technology, Utilisation, and Nutrition, pp. 28-38, (1995); Tseng Y.C., Moreira R., Sun X., Total frying use time effects on soybean-oil deterioration and on tortilla chip quality, Int J Food Sci Technol, 31, pp. 287-294, (1996); Irwandi J., Che Man Y.B., Kitts D.D., Synergistic effect of rosemary and sage extracts and citric acid on fatty acid retention RBD palm olein during deep-fat frying, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 77, pp. 527-533, (2000); Sharma S.K., Mulvaney S.J., Rizvi S.S.H., Material testing and theology of solid foods, Food Process Engineering Theory and Laboratory Experiments, pp. 20-50, (2000)","Y.B.

However, the application of emulsions in food production is restricted by two main obstacles, that is, physical and oxidative stability. The former has been comprehensively reviewed somewhere else, but our literature review indicated that there is a prominent ground for reviewing the latter across all kinds of emulsions. Therefore, the present study was formulated in order to review oxidation and oxidative stability in emulsions. In doing so, different measures to render oxidative stability to emulsions are reviewed after introducing lipid oxidation reactions and methods to measure lipid oxidation. These strategies are scrutinized in four main categories, namely storage conditions, emulsifiers, optimization of production methods, and antioxidants. Afterward, oxidation in all types of emulsions, including conventional ones (oil-in-water and water-in-oil) and uncommon emulsions in food production (oil-in-oil), is reviewed. Furthermore, the oxidation and oxidative stability of multiple emulsions, nanoemulsions, and Pickering emulsions are taken into account. Finally, oxidative processes across different parent and food emulsions were explained taking a comparative approach. © 2023 The Authors.

Lintnerisation led to degradation first in the amorphous domains and increased the crystallinity. The resulting increase in internal defects and brittleness made the granules more susceptible to breakage upon milling. Ball milling, although leading to some degree of crystallinity loss, could effectively reduce the size of acid-hydrolysed starch while the total double helix remained relatively unchanged. The resulting small-particle starch was structurally more heterogeneous (wider Tm range). Swelling of small-particle starch was accompanied by solubilisation of water-soluble fragments at a temperature greater than 60°C. The properties of individual granules are strongly influenced by the hydration and physicochemical properties of their amorphous and crystalline domains. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Acid hydrolysis; Ball mill; Cassava starch; Hydration; Small particle","Manihot esculenta; cassava; food science; starch","","","","","","","Jacob H., Delcour J.A., Hydrothermal modifications of granular starch, with retention of the granular structure: A review, J Agric Food Chem, 46, pp. 2895-2905, (1998); Jane J., Shen L., Wang L., Maningat C.C., Preparation and properties of small-particle corn starch, Cereal Chem, 69, pp. 280-283, (1992); Niemann C., Whistler R.L., Effect of acid hydrolysis and ball milling on porous corn starch, Starch/Stärke, 44, pp. 409-414, (1992); Chun J., Lim S., Takeda Y., Shoki M., Properties of high-crystalline rice amylodextrins prepared in acid-alcohol media as fat replacers, Cereal Foods World, 42, pp. 813-819, (1997); Kainuma K., French D., Nageli amylodextrin and its relationship to starch granule structure.

Among them, biopolymer micelles have various applications in the food industry due to their superior functional qualities and wide sources. Scope and approach: This review summarizes the general preparation methods for self-assembled micelles, the major types of natural molecular-based polymers, the factors that affect the stability of micelles, and the application of micelles in food science. The current challenges and future research prospects are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Self-assembled micelles are usually prepared by methods such as direct dissolution, dialysis, solvent evaporation, and film hydration. The stability of biopolymer-based micelles is affected by the polymer structure, temperature, pH, and other conditions. Amphiphilic bio-based polymer micelles have great potential in delivering hydrophobic ingredients with excellent loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. Biopolymer micelles can significantly improve the bioavailability of hydrophobic components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Functional food; Functional ingredients; Micelle; Polysaccharide; Protein","Biochemistry; Biomolecules; Functional food; Hydrophobicity; Micelles; Proteins; 'current; Amphiphilics; Food industries; Food science; Functional ingredient; Futures researches; Hydrophobics; Micelle structure; Preparation method; Solvent evaporation; Polysaccharides","","","","","Key R & D plan of Shandong Province, (2019YYSP005); Major Science and Technology Projects of Shandong Province, (2019JZZY010722); Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology Benefit People Project, (20-3-4-34-nsh); Special Funds for Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province, (ts201712058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31972028)","The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, China (No. 31972028 ), Key R & D plan of Shandong Province (No. 2019YYSP005), Qingdao Municipal Science and Technology Benefit People Project (No. 20-3-4-34-nsh), Major Science and Technology Projects of Shandong Province (No. 2019JZZY010722), and Special Funds for Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province (No. ts201712058).

In particular, Camellia japonica L. is a widespread species found in Galicia (NW Spain), where it has been largely exploited with ornamental purposes. Recent findings on its phytochemical characterization showed thousands of bioactive ingredients, mostly represented by phenolic compounds, together with terpenoids, and fatty acids. These molecules present associated biological activities, acting as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agents. This review is aimed at describing the main bioactive compounds of C. japonica, as well as the health-enhancing properties attributed to this medicinal plant. Novel strategies are needed to implement an efficient industrialization process for C. japonica, ranging from small-scale approaches to the establishment of large plantations, thus involving important sectors, such as the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. © 2022 The Authors","Biochemical valorization; Biological activities; Camellias; Food science; Medicinal plants; Natural bioactive compounds","Antimicrobial agents; Conservation; Fatty acids; Plant extracts; fatty acid; phenol derivative; phytochemical; terpenoid derivative; 'current; Bioactive compounds; Biochemical valorization; Camellias; Food science; Medicinal plants; Natural bioactive compound; Natural bioactives; Phytochemical; Valorisation; antidiabetic activity; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; antimicrobial activity; antineoplastic activity; antiobesity activity; antioxidant activity; Article; biological activity; Camellia japonica; cosmetic industry; drug industry; Galicia (Spain); industrialization; nonhuman; Bioactivity","","","","","CISUG; Juan de la Cierva Incorporación Hui Cao, (IJC2020-046055-I); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (RYC-2017-22891); Universidade de Vigo; Xunta de Galicia, (888003, CYTED—AQUA-CIBUS, ED481A-2019/0228, EXCELENCIA-ED431F 2020/12, H2020-BBI-JTI-2019, P317RT0003)","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results was supported by MICINN supporting the Ramón y Cajal grant for M.A. Prieto (RYC-2017-22891) and and the Juan de la Cierva Incorporación Hui Cao (IJC2020-046055-I); by Xunta de Galicia for supporting the pre-doctoral grant of A.G.

However, what no one can seem to agree on is what name should be given to this movement. The scientists and press have been keen to label it as the science of ‘molecular gastronomy’. However, many of the top chefs, after in some cases initially embracing the idea, have distanced themselves from that moniker. In their pronouncements and interviews, the latter have been keen to stress that while they are interested in the findings of scientific research, what they do is better conceptualized as the art and craft of cooking. Many of the top chefs have been inspired by the results of the scientific research much as they are inspired by what is happening in many other fields of endeavour, from painting to jazz etc. Given that it is mostly not what the chefs do, it becomes increasingly unclear whether ‘molecular gastronomy’ is itself anything more than a ‘glorified’ sub-discipline of food science. We believe, along with several other commentators, that the most appropriate name for what distinguishes contemporary culinary practice is what can be labelled ‘experimental cooking’. It is defined as much by its innovativeness, its novelty, its creativity, and by the way in which it engages with the diner's intellect and emotions (with the diner's brain in other words), as with their gut. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cooking movements; Experimental cooking; Food science; Haute cuisine; Modernist cuisine; Molecular gastronomy","","","","","","","","Accum F., (1820); Adria F.; Adria F., Blumenthal H., Keller T., McGee H., (2006); Aduriz A.L., Mugaritz: A Natural Science of Cooking, (2014); Aduriz A.L., Vergara J., Lasa D., Oliva O., Perise R., Culinary trompe-l'oeil: a new concept in coating, Int.

Response surface methodology (RSM) with a five-level/five-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters such as reaction time (8-24h), temperature (35 55°C), enzyme amount (10-50%), substrate molar ratio of lauric acid to kojic acid (1:1-3:1) and added water content (0-20%) on the percentage molar conversion to KAML by direct esterification. Reaction time and added water content were the most important variables, while substrate molar ratio had less effect on percentage molar conversion. Based on canonical analysis and ridge maximum analysis, optimal synthesis conditions were reaction time 19h, temperature 44°C, enzyme amount 38%, substrate molar ratio 2:1 and added water content 10%. The predicted value was 85% and the actual experimental value 82% molar conversion. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Enzymatic synthesis; Kojic acid monolaurate; Lipase; Optimisation; Response surface methodology","Burkholderia; Burkholderia cepacia; Pseudomonas; food science","","","","","","","Kinosita R., Shikata R., Toxic moldy rice, Mycotoxins in Foodstuffs, pp. 111-132, (1964); Saruno R., Kato F., Ikeno T., Kojic acid, a tyrosinase inhibitor from Aspergillus albus, Agric Biol Chem, 43, pp. 1337-1339, (1979); Chen J.S., Wei C., Marshall M.R., Inhibition mechanism of kojic acid on polyphenol oxidase, J Agric Food Chem, 39, pp. 1897-1901, (1991); Liu K.-J., Shaw J.-F., Lipase-catalyzed synthesis of kojic acid esters in organic solvents, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 75, pp. 1507-1511, (1998); Posorske L.H., Industrial-scale application of enzymes in the fats and oil industry, J Am Oil Chem Soc, 61, pp. 1758-1760, (1984); Ahmad R.W., Anderson W.A., Moo-Young M., Ester synthesis in lipase-catalyzed reactions, Enzyme Microb Technol, 23, pp. 438-450, (1998); Shieh C.-J., Chang S.-W., Optimized synthesis of lipase-catalyzed hexyl acetate in n-hcxane by response surface methodology, J Agric Food Chem, 77, pp. 521-526, (2001); Cochran W.G., Cox G.M., Experimental Designs, (1992); SAS User Guide, (1990); Shich C.-J., Akoh C.C., Yee L.N., Optimized enzymatic synthesis of geranyl butyrate with lipase AY from Candida rugosa, Biotechnol Bioengng, 51, pp. 371-374, (1996); Ott L., An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis, (1988)","C.-S.

Its importance in America with recent prospects for export, as well as its wide acceptance in western Africa and Southeast Asia, has stimulated interest in its conservation and processing. However, there is a lack of studies about its composition, needed to complete data that could be used for future research. This review shows a brief overview about the work that has been done in the past and recent years where tuberous roots have been characterized, used in food processing and development as well as included in the postharvest technology, food biotechnology and nanotechnology. Its purpose is to identify areas of lacking studies and also to give direction to research works to achieve a whole knowledge about this interesting tuberous root that could result in an increase of the applications of this underutilized crop such as production of oligosaccharides/monosaccharides, high glucose syrups, flour and wine and incorporated in yogurt or other milk products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","","Pachyrhizus; Crops; Dairy products; Food processing; Glucose; Tubes (components); Food biotechnology; Food crops; Food science; Milk products; Postharvest technologies; Southeast Asia; Tuberous roots; Biotechnology","","","","","","","Abud-Archilla M., Vazquez-Mandujano D.G., Ruiz-Cabrera M.A., Grajales-Lagunes A., Moscosa-Santillan M., Ventura-Canseco L.M.C., Et al., Optimization of osmotic dehydration of yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus) using an orthogonal experimental design, Journal of Food Engineering, 84, pp. 413-419, (2008); Amaya-Llano S.L., Martinez-Bustos F., Martinez A.L., Zazueta-Morales J., Comparative studies of some physico-chemical, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties of acid-thinned jicama and maize starches, Food Bioprocess Technology, 4, pp. 48-60, (2011); Artes F., Artes-Hernandez F., Injury caused by warm temperatures in fruits and vegetables post harvested, Advances in Science and Warm Techniques, 1, pp. 299-310, (2003); Badillo V., Castellanos J.Z., Fijación simbiótica de nitrógeno bajo condiciones de campo en Jícama (Pachyrhizus ahipa (Wedd.)

Control experiments confirmed that glucose release was not caused by cell lysis or extracellular maltose hydrolysis. To test the hypothesis that glucose efflux involved plasma membrane glucose transporters, experiments were performed with an S. cerevisiae strain in which all members of the hexose transporter (HXT) gene family had been eliminated and with an isogenic reference strain. Glucose efflux was virtually eliminated in the hexosetransport-deficient strain. This constitutes experimental proof that Hxt transporters facilitate export of glucose from S. cerevisiae cells. After exposure of the hexose-transport-deficient strain to excess maltose, an increase in the intracellular glucose level was observed, while the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and ATP remained relatively low. These results demonstrate that glucose efflux can occur as a result of uncoordinated expression of the initial steps of maltose metabolism and the subsequent reactions in glucose dissimilation. This is a relevant phenomenon for selection of maltose-constitutive strains for baking and brewing.","","Biological Transport; Fermentation; Glucose; Maltose; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Time Factors; Fungi; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Chemostats; Cytology; Genes; Glucose; Hydrolysis; Metabolism; Yeast; glucose; glucose transporter; maltose; food science; microbiology; article; brewing; fermentation; fungal metabolism; fungus growth; glucose transport; nonhuman; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; strain difference; transport kinetics; Control experiments; Maltose","","Glucose, 50-99-7; HXT1 protein, S cerevisiae, 139046-59-6; Maltose, 69-79-4; Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, ; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, ","","","","","Adam A.C., Prieto J.A., Rubio-Texeira M., Polaina J., Construction of a lactose-assimilating strain of baker's yeast, Yeast, 15, pp. 1299-1305, (1999); Barnett J.A., The utilization of disaccharides and some other sugars by yeasts, Adv.

This study provides baseline evidence to inform future interventions of benefit to CD sufferers by examining awareness of CD issues by food servers and preparation staff, assessing their claims to provide gluten-free foods by analysis of a meal concurrently sampled. While the majority of attempts to purchase a 'gluten-free' meal on request in restaurants were successful, some 10% of all samples contained gluten, 2.7% between 21 and 100mgkg-1, and 7.7% >100mgkg-1 and two unsatisfactory samples were purchased from so-called coeliac-friendly restaurants. These findings were consistent with those obtained previously by Collin et al. [Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics 19 (2004) 1277], Størsrud et al.

The Lamiaceae family has several species which are of great importance in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industry, as well as in traditional and modern medicine. In this manuscript we analyzed the chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) isolated from the aerial flowering organs of cultivated Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. and Z. tenuior L. using GC and GC–MS methods for the first time. In total, 17 and 21 compounds (comprising 99.7 % of total EO) were identified in Z. clinopodioides and Z. tenuior, respectively. The major identified compounds identified in essential oil analysis reported as pulegone (70.4 %) and menthone (11.5 %) for Z. clinopodioides, pulegone (55.1 %) and limonene (8.2 %) for Z. tenuior. Both Ziziphora species were rich in phenolic compounds (total phenol content: 30.3 ± 0.1 mg gallic acid/100 g EO and 49.0 ± 1.4 mg mg gallic acid/100 g EO; total flavonoids: 2.7 ± 0.3 mg quercetin/ 100 g EO and 6.6 ± 0.4 mg quercetin/ 100 g EO) and they contained high antioxidant properties with IC50: 147.2 ± 1.3 μg/mL and 111.4 ± 1.2 μg/mL in Z. tenuior and Z. clinopodioides, respectively. Furthermore, obtained results indicated that the reducing power of Z. tenuior was 7.5 ± 1.2 μg/mL while this number was 6.1 ± 0.7 μg/mL for Z. clinopodioides. We have also investigated the antibacterial activity of the EOs on seven current important foodborne pathogenic bacteria. Results showed that the EO of Z. clinopodioides and Z. tenuior possess an acceptable antimicrobial effect on the studied microbes. This research indicated that the EOs of two species of Ziziphora due to their main components such as pulegone, menthone and limonene as well as high phenolic content could be considered as good sources of natural antioxidant and antibacterial material in which have the high potential to use for food science as well as food preservative. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antibacterial; Antioxidant; Essential oil; Pulegone; Ziziphora species","Lamiaceae; Ziziphora; Antennas; Antioxidants; Bacteria; Chemical analysis; Flavonoids; Food preservatives; Monoterpenes; Phenols; Plants (botany); Anti-bacterial activity; Anti-microbial effects; Anti-oxidant activities; Antibacterial materials; Antioxidant properties; Chemical compositions; Food-borne pathogenic bacteria; Total phenol contents; antimicrobial activity; antioxidant; essential oil; food science; medicinal plant; phenolic compound; Essential oils","","","","","Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University","The present research was carried out with the financial support of the Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, Tabriz, Iran .","Abdurrazak M., Rao M.U.S., Ado A.B., Mohd K.S., Thant Z., Some natural products and their secondary metabolites attributed towards diabetic cure: a review, Int.

Rapid changes have been observed in the texture of hake muscle during frozen storage, while gilthead sea bream has proved to be more stable. In order to ascertain the role of muscle proteins in the changes observed during storage, parameters related to protein functionality and the properties of extracted natural actomyosin (HAM) were studied initially and during storage in ice or at -20°C. Initially, the parameters related to functionality had higher values in hake muscle and extracted HAM than in gilthead sea bream. At the end of iced storage (22 days), less myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin were extracted from hake, but there was practically no change in gilthead sea bream. This decrease was not accompanied by lower Ca2+-ATPase activity. Freezing produced no drastic changes, with lower values for gilthead sea bream. However, this species was more stable after 1 year, except for the Ca2+-ATPase activity of HAM. This suggests that the changes that hake proteins underwent during storage particularly affected properties related to aggregation, whereas in gilthead sea bream the changes hardly affected the formation of soluble or insoluble aggregates but did affect the active sites of myosin. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Actomyosin; Frozen storage; Gilthead sea bream; Hake; Iced storage; Protein","Archosargus rhomboidalis; Hyperoglyphe porosa; Merluccius; Merluccius merluccius; Rexea solandri; Sparus; Sparus aurata; fish; food science","","","","","","","Huss H.H., Quality and quality changes in fresh fish, FAO Fish Tech Paper, 348, (1995); Matsumoto J.J., Chemical deterioration of muscle proteins during frozen storage, ACS Symp Ser, 123, pp. 95-124, (1980); Fukuda Y., Tarakita Z., Kawamura M., Kakehata K., Arai K., Denaturation of myofibrillar protein in chub mackerel during freezing and storage, Bull Jpn Soc Sci Fish, 48, pp. 1627-1632, (1982); Matsumoto J.J., Noguchi S.F., Cryostabilization of protein in surimi, Surimi Technology, pp. 357-388, (1992); Park J.W., Surimi and Surimi Seafood, (2000); Tejada M., Aggregation of myofibrillar proteins during frozen storage of fish, Novel Processes and Control Technologies in the Food Industry, Vol 338 of NA TO Scientific Series.

A feeding trial was conducted with fish meal based diets containing 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% lipid for 24 wk. Menhaden oil was the lipid ingredient. Weight gain was significantly greater in fish fed the 30% lipid diet than in fish fed either 10%, 15% or 20% lipid diets. There were no significant differences in visceral somatic index. Fillet lipid concentration of fish fed the 30% lipid diet (9.2-g lipid/100-g fillet) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than fish fed either the 10% or 15% lipid diets (5.8- and 6.9-g lipid/100-g fillet, respectively). In samples stored for 3 d at 5 C or 8 wk at -20 C, sensory panelists reported that the cooked fillets from fish fed the 30% lipid diet were ""more fishy"" than fish fed the 15% lipid diet, and preferred the cooked fillets from the 15% lipid treatment over the 30% lipid treatment. Triangle tests and fillet colorimetry showed no significant differences between fillets from fish fed the 15% and 30% lipid diets at any sampling time point. No significant differences in fillet concentrations of thiobarbituric reactive substances were observed among dietary treatments stored at either 5 C or -20 C. These results suggest that two main effects of feeding a 30% lipid diet (with fish oil as the lipid source) are a higher lipid concentration in the fillet and a ""fishier"" aroma compared to fillets from fish fed a 15% lipid diet.","","Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae; aquaculture; food science","","","","","","","AFIA Laboratory Methods Compendium, (1999); Official Methods of Analysis, (2000); Gaylord T.G., Gatlin III.

Lipids are the main components of food as well as the important structural and functional components of cells. Nevertheless, lipids are easily oxidized by different ways, such as thermal oxidation and air oxidation. Lipid oxidation has adverse effects on food quality and human health. Therefore, efforts should be made to reduce lipid oxidation and improve its stability.

Yet many scholars have understood how one tastes as only a matter of aesthetics. New forms of doing work through the senses, associated with twentieth-century industrialized food production, have made it clear that the sensations produced by mouths and noses do more than mark class—they carry economic value. It seems that it is time we attend more closely to this sensory labor and its place in the food system. Recognizing perception as a form of labor mobilized throughout the food system offers to dissolve the apparent dichotomy between a focus on food as an object of consumption, evaluated on its aesthetic principles, and of production, evaluated on its ethical implications. Sustained examination of sensing as found in the essays in this issue demonstrates that the types and modes of sensory labor mobilized in the provisioning, making, and eating of food are not neutral—rather they coproduce modes of food production. In doing so, these essays not only open the door for valuing otherwise unacknowledged work, but also point towards opportunities for critical intervention in how we talk about and practice taste and, in the process, make society. © 2019, © 2019 Association for the Study of Food and Society.","coproduction; food consumption; food science; labor; sensory evaluation; Sensory studies; value chains","","","","","","","","Albala K., Eating Right in the Renaissance, (2002); Berenstein N., Designing Flavors for Mass Consumption, The Senses and Society, 13, 1, pp. 19-40, (2018); Besky S., Brown S., Looking for Work: Placing Labor in Food Studies, Labor: Studies in Working Class HIstory of the Americas, 12, 1-2, pp. 19-43, (2015); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, (1987); Butler E., Tasting Off-Flavors: Food Science, Sensory Knowledge and the Consumer Sensorium, The Senses and Society, 13, 1, pp. 75-88, (2018); Dickau J., Inventing Texture: Edible Science and the Management of Familiarity, 1963–1975, Global Food History, 3, 2, pp. 171-193, (2017); Drake M.A., Invited Review: Sensory Analysis of Dairy Foods, Journal of Dairy Science, 90, 11, pp. 4925-4937, (2007); Goldstein J.E., The ‘Coffee Doctors’: The Language of Taste and the Rise of Rwanda’s Specialty Bean Value, Food and Foodways, 19, 1-2, pp. 135-159, (2011); Hatch A.R., Blood Sugar: Racial Pharmacology and Food Justice in Black America, (2016); Hayden T.B., Traders in Uncertainty: Criminal Violence, Law(Lessness) and (Dis)Order in Mexico’s Central Food Market, (2019); Hennion A., Those Things that Hold Us Together: Taste and Sociology, Cultural Sociology, 1, 1, pp. 97-114, (2007); Hisano A., The Rise of Synthetic Colors in the American Food Industry, 1870–1940, Business History Review, 90, 3, pp. 483-504, (2016); Howes D., Sensual Relations: Engaging the Senses in Cultural and Social Theory, (2003); Howes D., Drazin A., Kuchler S., The Science of Sensory Evaluation: An Ethnographic Critique, The Social Life of Materials: Studies in Materials and Society, (2015); Jackson D.D., Scents of Place: The Dysplacement of a First Nations Community in Canada, American Anthropologist, 113, 4, pp. 606-618, (2011); Jegathesan M., Deficient Realities: Expertise and Uncertainty among Tea Plantation Workers in Sri Lanka, Dialectical Anthropology, 39, 3, pp. 255-272, (2015); Kenner A., Breathtaking: Asthma Care in a Time of Climate Change, (2018); Korsmeyer C., Making Sense of Taste: Food and Philosophy, (1999); Lahne J., Sensory Science, the Food Industry, and the Objectification of Taste, Anthropology of Food, (2016); Lahne J., Standard Sensations: The Production of Objective Experience from Industrial Technique, The Senses and Society, 13, pp. 6-18, (2018); Lahne J., Spackman C., Accounting for Taste: Technologies for Capturing Food-Sensory Experience, The Senses and Society, 13, 1, pp. 1-5, (2018); Latour B., Lynch M., Woolgar S., Drawing Things Together, Representation in Scientific Practice, pp. 19-68, (1990); Latour B., How to Talk about the Body?

Juan de la Cierva 3, Spain","Genetic improvement of industrial yeast strains is restricted by the availability of selectable transformation markers. Antibiotic resistance markers have to be avoided for public health reasons, while auxotrophy markers are generally not useful for wine yeast strain transformation because most industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are prototrophic. For this work, we performed a comparative study of the usefulness of two alternative dominant selectable markers in both episomic and centromeric plasmids. Even though the selection for sulfite resistance conferred by FZF1-4 resulted in a larger number of transformants for a laboratory strain, the p-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine resistance conferred by ARO4-OFP resulted in a more suitable selection marker for all industrial strains tested. Both episomic and centromeric constructions carrying this marker resulted in transformation frequencies close to or above 103 transformants per μg of DNA for the three wine yeast strains tested.","","Drug Resistance, Fungal; Genetic Markers; Industrial Microbiology; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; p-Fluorophenylalanine; Plasmids; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sulfites; Transformation, Genetic; Wine; Animalia; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Antibiotics; DNA; Health care; Wine; Yeast; 4 fluorophenylalanine; sulfite; biotechnology; food science; microbiology; yeast; animal cell; antibiotic resistance; article; cell transformation; controlled study; fermentation optimization; nonhuman; Antibiotic resistance; Sulfite resistance; Yeast strains; Biomarkers","","4 fluorophenylalanine, 51-65-0, 60-17-3; sulfite, 14265-45-3; Genetic Markers, ; p-Fluorophenylalanine, 60-17-3; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, ; Sulfites, ","","","","","Agatep R., Kirkpatrick R.D., Parchaliuk D.L., Woods R.A., Gietz R.D., Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethyiene glycol (LiAc/ ss-DNA/PEG) protocol, Technical Tips Online 1:51:P01525; Alikhanyan S.I., Nalbandyan G.M., Selection of wine yeasts using mutagens.

The addition of Pronase E alone led to a large increase in the content of free amino acids. The CFE showed deaminative activity, which gave rise to the accumulation of some important volatile compounds such as 2-methylpropanal and 2- and 3-methylbutanal. Organoleptic analysis reflected an improvement in the quality of the sausages, especially when the two treatments were combined. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Cell-free extract; Fermented sausages; Penicillium camemberti; Pronase E","Penicillium; Penicillium camemberti; Streptomyces; Streptomyces griseus; food science","","","","","","","Ordonez J.A., Fernandez M., Hierro E.M., Bruna J.M., Herranz B., De la Hoz L., Consideraciones acerca de la maduración acelerada de embutidos crudos curados, Eurocarne, 68, pp. 53-57, (1998); Gripon J.C., Flavour and texture in soft cheese, Microbiology and Biochemistry of Cheese and Fermented Milk, pp. 193-218, (1997); Molimard P., Spinnler E.H., Review: Compounds involved in the flavour of surface mould-ripened cheeses: Origins and properties, J Dairy Sci, 79, pp. 169-184, (1996); Wellner D., Lichtenberg L.A., Assay of amino acid oxidase, Methods Enzymol B, 17, pp. 593-605, (1971); Careri M., Mangia A., Barbieri G., Bolzoni L., Virgili R., Parolari G., Sensory property relationships to chemical data of Italian-type dry-cured ham, J Food Sci, 58, pp. 968-972, (1993); King A.D., Hocking A.D., Pitt J.I., Dichloran-rose Bengal medium for enumeration and isolation of molds from foods, Appl Environ Microbiol, 37, pp. 959-964, (1979); Lowry O.H., Rosenbrough N.J., Farr A.L., Randall R.J., Protein measurement with the folin phenol reagent, J Biol Chem, 193, pp. 265-275, (1951); Mosmann T., Rapid colorimetric assay for cellular growth and survival: Application to proliferation and cytotoxicity assays, J Immunol Methods, 65, pp. 55-63, (1983); Martinez A., Ikken Y., Cambero M.I., Marin M.L., Haza A.I., Casas C., Morales P., Mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of fruits and vegetables evaluated by the Ames test and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, Food Sci Technol Int, 5, pp. 431-437, (1999); Hanson S.W.F., Olley J., Application of the Bligh and Dyer method of lipid extraction to tissue homogenates, Biochem J, 89, pp. 101-102, (1963); Fernandez M., Hoz L., Diaz O., Cambero I., Ordonez J.A., Effect of the addition of pancreatic lipase on the ripening of dry fermented sausages.

The cultivars varied considerably in their protein characteristics and chapati-making potential. Results clearly indicated that both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of proteins influenced the chapati-making potential of cultivars. Puffed height, the important qualitative parameter of chapati, was positively correlated with protein content (r = 0.62, p < 0.05), gluten content (r = 0.79, p < 0.01), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation value (r = 0.57, p < 0.05) and Glu-1 quality scores of high-molecularweight (HMW) subunits (r = 0.66, p < 0.01). Overall quality score of chapati was positively correlated with gluten content (r = 0.64, p < 0.01), SDS sedimentation value (r = 0.60, p < 0.05) and Glu-1 Score (r = 0.58, p < 0.05). HMW subunit composition varied considerably among cultivars. Cultivars having 5+10 subunits at the Glu-1D chromosome, a protein content of about 130gkg-1 and SDS sedimentation value around 75ml yielded excellent chapatis, while those having 2+12 subunits, a protein content of about 115gkg-1 and SDS sedimentation value around 55ml resulted in poor chapatis. Interestingly, the presence of the 1BL/1RS chromosome in cultivars had no adverse effect on chapati quality. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Chapati quality; Glu-1 score; HMW subunit composition; Indian wheat cultivars; Protein characteristics","Triticum aestivum; food science","","","","","","","Haridas Rao P., Leelavathi K., Shurpalekar S.R., Objective measurements of the consistency of chapati dough using a research water absorption meter, J Texture Stud, 17, pp. 401-420, (1986); Haridas Rao P., Chapati and related products, Encyclopedia of Food Science, Food Technology and Nutrition, 2, pp. 795-801, (1993); Bushuk W., Functionality of wheat proteins in dough, Cereal Foods World, 29, (1984); Dexter J.E., Matsuo R.R., The effect of gluten protein fractions on pasta dough rheology and spaghetti making quality, Cereal Chem, 55, pp. 44-57, (1978); Finney K.F., Fractionating and reconstituting techniques as tools in wheat flour research, Cereal Chem, 20, pp. 381-396, (1943); Finney K.F., Barmore M.A., Loaf volume and protein content of hard winter and spring wheats, Cereal Chem, 25, pp. 291-312, (1948); Webb T., Heaps P.W., Coppock J.B.M., Protein quality and quantity: A rheological assessment of their relative importance in breadmaking, J Food Technol, 6, pp. 47-62, (1971); Orth R.A., Bushuk W., A comparative study of proteins of wheats of diverse baking qualities, Cereal Chem, 49, pp. 268-275, (1972); MacRitchie F., Du Cros D.L., Wrigley C.W., Flour polypeptides related to wheat quality, Adv Cereal Sci Technol, 10, pp. 79-145, (1990); Payne P.I., Nightingale M.A., Krattiger A.F., Holt L.M., The relationship between HMW glutenin subunit composition and breadmaking quality of British grown wheat varieties, J Sci Food Agric, 38, pp. 51-65, (1987); MacRitchie F., Wheat protein: Physico-chemical properties and functionality, Adv Food Nutr Res, 36, pp. 3-87, (1992); Kolster P., Vereijken J.M., Evaluating HMW glutenin subunits to improve breadmaking quality of wheat, Cereal Foods World, 38, pp. 76-82, (1993); Branlord G., Dardevet M., Diversity of grain protein and bread quality.

Today, the amount of energy consumption in agriculture has also increased due to the need for sufficient food for the growing population. Thus, agricultural policymakers in most countries rely on prediction models to influence food security policies. This research aims to predict and reduce the amount of energy consumption in wheat production. Data were collected from the farms of Estahban city in Fars province of Iran by the Jihad Agricultural Department’s experts for 20 years from 1994 to 2013. In this study, a novel prediction method based on consumed energy in the production period is proposed. The model is developed based on artificial intelligence to forecast the output energy in wheat production and uses extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector regression (SVR). In the experimental stage, the value of elevation metrics for the EVM and ELM was reported to be equal to 0.000000409 and 0.9531, respectively. Total input energy (consumed) is found to be 1,460,503.1 Mega Joules (MJ), and output energy (produced wheat) is 1,401,011.945 MJ for the Estahban. The result indicates the superiority of the ELM model to enhance the decisions of the agricultural policymakers. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the nonhalal ingredients that commonly found in food and pharmaceutical products is gelatin which extracted from porcine source. Bovine and fish gelatin are also becoming the main commercial sources of gelatin. However, unclear information and labeling regarding the actual sources of gelatin in food and pharmaceutical products have become the main concern in halal authenticity issue since porcine consumption is prohibited for Muslims. Hence, numerous analytical methods involving chemical and chemometric analysis have been developed to identify the sources of gelatin. Chemical analysis techniques such as biochemical, chromatography, electrophoretic, and spectroscopic are usually combined with chemometric and mathematical methods such as principal component analysis, cluster, discriminant, and Fourier transform analysis for the gelatin classification. A sample result from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, which combines Fourier transform and spectroscopic technique, is included in this paper. This paper presents an overview of chemical and chemometric methods involved in identification of different types of gelatin, which is important for halal authentication purposes. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®","chemical methods;

A multitude of scientific publications have also pointed to the importance of food and nutrition in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The present perspective critically addresses the question of what food science can actually contribute in this context. Animal studies suggest that micronutrients, food bioactives or functional foods may carry the potential to augment viral defense. However, the specific roles of food components in viral infectious diseases in humans remain unclear. Rigorous research assessing the efficacy of food compounds in counteracting infections would require long-term randomized controlled trials in large samples. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. High-energy diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Therefore, population-wide body weight control and weight reduction in overweight people are important preventive measures. Diet may play a beneficial role in maintaining a healthy body weight and preventing non-communicable conditions. © 2021 KeAi Communications Co.

Cleaning and disinfection practices applied to the processing environment are vital to maintain this safety; yet, current approaches can incur costly downtime and the potential for microorganisms to grow and establish, if not effectively removed. For that reason, manufacturers are seeking nonthermal, online, and continuous disinfection processes to control the microbial levels within the processing environment. One such emerging technique, with great potential, is cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP). This review presents the latest advances and challenges associated with CAP-based technologies for the decontamination of surfaces and equipment found within the food-processing environment. It provides a detailed overview of the technology and a comprehensive analysis of the many CAP-based antimicrobial studies on food-contact surfaces and materials. As CAP is considered an emerging technique, many of the recent studies are still in the preliminary stages, with results obtained under widely different conditions. This lack of cohesive information and an inability to directly compare CAP systems has greatly impeded technological development. The review further explores the challenge of scaling CAP technology to meet industry needs, considering aspects such as regulatory constraints, environmental credentials, and cost of use. Finally, a discussion is presented on the future outlook for CAP technology in this area, identifying key challenges that must be addressed to promote industry uptake. © 2022 The Authors.

We present a robust and facile label-free colorimetric aptasensor for OTA detection using the aptamer-enhanced oxidase-like activity of MnO2 nanoflowers. The catalytic activities of the nanozymes could be improved by adsorption of the aptamers onto the MnO2 nanoflowers due to the increased affinity of the nanoflowers for the chromogenic substrate. The linear range for OTA detection varied from 0.05 to 33.35 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.069 ng/mL. The limit of detection of the proposed strategy is equivalent to or even better than those of several previous methods. Moreover, the colorimetric aptasensor exhibited good specificity and stability for the analysis of OTA in wheat flour and red wine samples. Therefore, this method appears to have promising applications in the detection of mycotoxins. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aptamer; Colorimetric detection; Food samples; MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers; Ochratoxin A","Aptamers, Nucleotide; Biosensing Techniques; Chromogenic Compounds; Colorimetry; Flour; Humans; Limit of Detection; Manganese Compounds; Mycotoxins; Ochratoxins; Oxides; Oxidoreductases; Triticum; Catalyst activity; Color; Colorimetry; Damage detection; Manganese oxide; Mycotoxins; aptamer; chromogenic substrate; manganese dioxide; nanoflower; ochratoxin; oxidoreductase; water oil cream; manganese derivative; mycotoxin; ochratoxin; oxide; oxidoreductase; Aptamers; Aptasensors; Colorimetric detection; Food samples; Food science; Human health; Label free; MnO2 nanoflower; Ochratoxin A; Ochratoxin A detections; adsorption; Article; catalysis; colorimetry; comparative study; controlled study; DNA base composition; DNA sequence; enzyme activity; hydrodynamics; hydrogen bond; limit of detection; Michaelis constant; molecular stability; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; red wine; static electricity; toxin analysis; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; wheat flour; zeta potential; colorimetry; flour; genetic procedures; human; procedures; wheat; Nanoflowers","","manganese dioxide, 1313-13-9; ochratoxin, 303-47-9, 37203-43-3; oxidoreductase, 9035-73-8, 9035-82-9, 9037-80-3, 9055-15-6; oxide, 16833-27-5; Aptamers, Nucleotide, ; Chromogenic Compounds, ; Manganese Compounds, ; Mycotoxins, ; ochratoxin A, ; Ochratoxins, ; Oxides, ; Oxidoreductases, ","","","Key Laboratory of Se-enriched Products Development and Quality Control; Shiyanjia Lab; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA, (Se-2021C01); Wuhan Polytechnic University, WHPU, (2022J09)","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Research and Innovation Initiatives of WHPU (2022J09) and Key Laboratory of Se-enriched Products Development and Quality Control, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (Se-2021C01).

This neurological syndrome is endemic in some communities in south-western Nigeria. Studies have shown that methods of processing cassava roots determine the quantity of cyanogens in gari. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the method of dewatering and the duration of fermentation on cyanogens in gari. Cassava roots (400 kg) were peeled, washed, grated and divided into 14 woven polyethylene sacks. The mash in seven of the sacks was dewatered continuously during fermentations, while the mash in the remaining seven sacks was fermented without dewatering, but dewatered at the end of fermentation. Cassava mash from each treatment was roasted into gari at 24 h intervals up to 168 h. Mean cyanohydrin content in gari roasted from cassava mash dewatered continuously during fermentation was 10.8 mg HCN eq kg-1 dw (CI 9.7-11.9), while mean cyanohydrin content in gari roasted from cassava mash dewatered after fermentation was 6.3 mg HCN eq kg-1 dw (CI 5.3-7.4). Mean linamarin content was 4.0 mg HCN eq kg-1 dw (CI 3.1-4.9) and mean HCN content was 1.6 mg kg-1 dw (CI 1.3-1.9) in gari roasted from cassava mash dewatered continuously, while mean linamarin content was 3.2 mg HCN eq kg-1 dw (CI 2.3-4.0) and mean HCN content was 1.2 mg kg-1 dw (CI 0.9-1.5) in gari roasted from cassava mash dewatered after fermentation. The method of dewatering cassava mash and the duration of fermentation were significantly associated with the level of cyanohydrin in gari (p < 0.001). This study shows that dewatering of cassava mash continuously during fermentation contributes to the dietary cyanide load in TAN-affected communities. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Ataxia; Cassava; Cyanogens; Cyanohydrins; Gari; Nutrition","Gari; Manihot esculenta; cassava; food science; toxin","","","","","","","Monekosso G.L., Clinical epidemiologic observations on an ataxic syndrome in Western Nigeria, Trop Geogr Med, 4, pp. 316-323, (1964); Osuntokun B., Monekosso G., Wilson J., Relationship of a degenerative tropical neuropathy to diet: Report of a field survey, Br Med J, 1, pp. 547-550, (1969); Osuntokun B., Epidemiology of tropical nutritional neuropathy in Nigerians, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 65, pp. 454-479, (1971); Oluwole O.S.A., Onabolu A.O., Link H., Rosling H., Persistence of the tropical ataxic neuropathy in a Nigerian community, J Neurol, Neurosurgery Psychiatry, 69, pp. 96-101, (2000); Monekosso G.L., Wilson J., Plasma thiocyanate and vitamin B12 in Nigerian patients with degenerative neurological disease, Lancet, 1, pp. 1062-1064, (1966); Osuntokun B., Monekosso G., Wilson J., Cassava diet and a chronic degenerative neuropathy: An epidemiological study, Nigerian J Sci, 3, pp. 3-15, (1969); Vasconcelos A., Twiddy D., Westby A., Reilly P., Detoxification of cassava during gari preparation, Int J Food Sci Technol, 25, pp. 198-203, (1990); Giraud E., Gosselin L., Raimbault M., Production of a lactobacillus starter with linamarase and amylase activities for cassava fermentation, J Sci Food Agric, 62, pp. 77-82, (1993); Onabolu A.O., Bokanga M., Rosling H., Cassava processing in a Nigerian community affected by a neuropathy attributed to dietary cyanide exposure, Trop Sci, 39, pp. 129-135, (1999); Sokari T., Karibo P., Changes in cassava toxicity during processing into gari and ijapu - Two fermented food products, Food Addit Contam, 9, pp. 379-384, (1992); Sanni M., Sobamiwa A., Eyinla M., Rosling H., Safety aspects of processing cassava to gari in Nigeria, Acta Hort, 375, pp. 227-231, (1994); Almazan A.M., Influence of cassava variety and storage on gari quality, Trop Agric (Trinidad), 69, pp. 386-390, (1992); Onabolu A.O., Oluwole O.S.A., Bokanga M., Loss of residual cyanogens in a cassava food during short-time storage, Int J Food Sci Nutr, (2002); Westby A., Twiddy D.R., Characterisation of gari and fu-fu preparation procedures in Nigeria, World J Microbiol Biotechnol, 8, pp. 175-182, (1992); Onabolu A.O., Oluwole O.S.A., Bokanga M., Rosling H., Ecological variation of intake of cassava food and dietary cyanide load in Nigerian communities, Public Health Nutr, 4, pp. 871-876, (2001); Official Methods of Analysis, (1990); Essers A., Bosveld M., Van der Grift R., Voragen A., Studies on the quantification of specific cyanogens in cassava products and introduction of a new chromogen, J Sci Food Agric, 63, pp. 287-296, (1993); Fomunyam R.T., Adegbola A.A., Oke O.L., The stability of cyanohydrins, Food Chem, 17, pp. 221-225, (1985); Selmar D., Carvalho F., Conn E., A colorimetric assay for alpha-hydroxynitrile lyase, Anal Biochem, 166, pp. 208-211, (1987); Cooke R.D., An enzymatic assay for the total cyanide content of cassava, J Sci Food Agric, 29, pp. 345-352, (1978); Oyewole O., Odunfa S., Characterisation of lactobacilli in fermenting cassava and their evaluation as cassava starter cultures, in Traditional African Foods - Quality and Nutrition, pp. 145-150, (1991); Ognyanov V., Datcheva V., Kyler K., Preparation of chiral cyanohydrins by an oxynitrilase-mediated transcyanation, J Am Chem Soc, 113, pp. 6992-6996, (1991); Griengl H., Klempier N., Pochlauer P., Schmidt M., Shi N., Zabelinskaja-Mackova A., Enzyme catalysed formation of (S)-cyanohydrins derived from aldehydes and ketones in a biphasic solvent system, Tetrahedron, 54, pp. 14477-14486, (1998); Okafor N., Umeh C., Ibenegbu C., Obizoba I., Nnam N., Improvement of garri quality by the inoculation of microorganisms into cassava mash, Int J Food Microbiol, 40, pp. 43-49, (1998); Onabolu A., Bokanga M., Tylleskar T., Rosling H., High cassava production and low dietary cyanide exposure in mid-west Nigeria, Public Health Nutr, 4, pp. 3-9, (2001); Sokari T., Taribo P., Short duration processing for high quality gari production, J Sci Food Agric, 70, pp. 427-432, (1996)","A.O.

However, high soluble solids concentration at harvest does not always correspond with high overall fruit quality and should be used in conjunction with the evaluation of aroma. In order to find quality indices, correlations were checked between aroma compounds detected on the melon pulp by headspace gas chromatography and sensory evaluation. Eight cultivars of muskmelon were analysed for their aroma content and other quality parameters. Aroma compounds were mainly esters, while (Z)-6-nonenal and (E)-6-nonenol, characteristic of melon, were not detected with the technique used. The data were subjected to statistical analyses in order to find significant correlations. High values of correlation were not found between chromatographic and sensory data, but a high correlation was found between total aromas and ethyl esters, both data of analytical source. This fact means that ethyl esters could be very important compounds for melon flavour and could be considered as markers of a good-quality aroma. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.","Aroma composition; Muskmelon; Quality parameters; Sensory analysis","Cucumis; Cucumis melo; Cucumis melo var. reticulatus; food science","","","","","","","Yabumoto K., Yamaguchi M., Jennings W.G., Production of volatile compounds by muskmelon Cucumis melo L., Food Chem, 3, pp. 7-15, (1978); Maarse H., Visscher C.A., Volatile Compounds in Food - Qualitative Data.

Mechanical abrasion prior to milling significantly increased FN and reduced amylase activity in preharvest sprouted wheat. The abraded grains were milled and the resultant flour samples were evaluated for starch gelatinization properties and yellow alkaline noodle (YAN) quality. Mechanical abrasion on sprouted kernels resulted in significant improvements in starch pasting properties accompanied by marginal decreases in flour ash and protein contents. Initial noodle brightness L* improved in most samples with mechanical abrasion. However, L* values dropped significantly during storage, with the greatest decline seen in the highly sprouted sample. Noodle cooking and textural qualities were relatively unaffected by sprout damage or mechanical abrasion, possibly due to amylase inhibition by the carbonate salts present in the formula. Mechanical abrasion prior to milling was found to reduce amylase activity significantly in moderately sprouted wheat. YAN, however, showed high tolerance to sprout damage, and produced noodles of acceptable texture without mechanical abrasion. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.","Mechanical abrasion; Noodles; Pearling; Sprout damage; Wheat quality","Triticum aestivum; food science; qualitative analysis; wheat","","","","","","","Sorrells M.E., Paterson A.H., Finney P.L., Milling and baking quality of soft white wheat genotypes subjected to preharvest sprouting, Cereal Chem, 66, (1989); Bean M.M., Keagy P.M., Fullington J.G., Jones F.T., Mecham D.K., Dried Japanese noodles.

We developed a method for determining the prevalence of blood spotting and determined the effects of various exsanguination methods on the prevalence of blood spotting in Atlantic salmon. A methodology based on salting, slicing and direct counting of blood spots was effective for assessing blood spots in salmon. This was superior to examination of fresh or frozen fillets for the detection of commercially important blood spots. Exsanguination reduced blood spots relative to unbled controls, but no clear trends between various methods of exsanguination and blood spots were observed. Although exsanguination affected the number of spots in smoked salmon, it is concluded that other unknown factors play a more important role. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the recent years there has been an extended commercial interest for different A. digitata products. As a spectacular African key species there has been a growing interest from NGO′s and various research groups. A research group, focussing on the following countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, has participated in a concerted research action with cross counter disciplinary cooperation between plant physiology, population genetics, tree breeding, food science, and socioeconomics. This paper presents a review and the way knowledge gaps are being addressed using the above mentioned approach. The overall work was initiated in 2005-2006 when a large collection of A. digitata seeds was carried out in 15 African countries. Fourteen populations were selected in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger including more than 400 superior trees, and many of the trees have been selected along with farmers in a participatory process. Studies have been initiated in all countries on geographic variation of growth, adaptive and phenological traits. This includes studies in the nursery, establishment of international provenance series, seed orchards and studies of gene flow and phylogeographic variation with various markers. Specific nursery trials have been established in order to study provenance and progeny performance related to drought stress. Several stress related characteristics are being measured. Preliminary observations showed large morphological variation between African provenances of A. digitata. Food properties of plant parts have been studied within and between populations. This includes studies of total biomass production, vitamin A, B1, B2, and various minerals. The influence of stress will be related to these parameters. Fruits, which are rich in sugar and vitamin C, are used as an ingredient in juice and other foods. Seeds can be used directly as food ingredient or in fermented condition (Maari). The fermentation process was previously poorly described. Therefore, the microorganisms associated with Baobab seeds fermentation have been identified and a starter cultures for control production has been proposed. The efficiency of dissemination of superior A. digitata trees depends on vegetative propagation. Various grafting methods are currently being tested in cooperation with farmers. Micropropagation is tested as well as a method for clone propagation. The accumulated knowledge will be applied for a domestication strategy of A. digitata in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The outcome from this study will be guidelines for protection and management of the germplasm of A. digitata resources. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Food security; Genetic variation; Tree breeding; Vegetative propagation","Asexual Reproduction; Breeding; Clones; Extractives; Fermentation; Food; Genes; Research; Seeds; Sugars; Trees; Vitamins; Burkina Faso; Mali; Niger [West Africa]; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata; Cloning; Fermentation; Food supply; Forestry; Genes; Plant extracts; Seed; Sugars; Vitamins; Burkina Faso; Drought stress; Fermentation process; Food ingredients; Food properties; Food science; Food security; Gene flows; Genetic variation; Geographic variation; Germplasms; Grafting method; Knowledge gaps; Micropropagation; Morphological variation; Niger; Participatory process; Plant physiology; Population genetics; Protection and management; Research approach; Research groups; Seed orchard; Socio-economics; Starter cultures; Total biomass; Tree breeding; Vegetative propagation; Vitamin A; Vitamin C; West Africa; agricultural research; agricultural worker; clonal growth; domestication; fermentation; food security; gene flow; genetic resource; genetic variation; germplasm; grafting; guideline; microbial community; mineral; orchard; participatory approach; phenology; phylogeography; plant breeding; research work; socioeconomic impact; vegetative propagation; vitamin; Research","","","","","FP7 International Cooperation, INCO, (015465); Sixth Framework Programme, FP6; Rådet for Udviklingsforskning, RUF, (DAN 8-912)","Acknowledgments The research underlying this paper includes several projects, supported by two sources: The Sahelian Fruit Tree project (SAFRUIT, supported by the European Union’s Sixth Framework Programme, INCO contract no. 015465), the NUTREE project (supported by the Danish Council for Development Research, contract no.
