Yet, it is unclear how effective they are in making viewers consider climate change as important. To assess their reception, this research studies and compares AIVs in relation to four additional visual forms, which are common in the communication of climate change (information visualizations, news photos, digital art visuals and cartoons). Qualitative research consisting of a short survey, q-sort and semi-structured interviews was employed. Some AIVs were judged clearer and more agreed with than other AIVs, suggesting that a less abstract AIV style might be more suitable. In comparison to the other visual forms, the artistic information visualizations were the least effective in making viewers consider climate change as important. It appears that artists’ free choice of data focus and artistic styles faces limits when depicting a complex topic such as climate change. A need for clarity or accompanying descriptions to the visualizations, at least when targeted at the general public without art training, might be necessary. The study did not show distrust in art’s involvement in the climate change discourse. © 2020 The Author(s).

Predominantly established during the 1970s, they have been founded by artist collectives typically operating within urban contexts, with the aim of providing new opportunities to cope with the physical, economic and cultural constraints that generally impede the professional development of artists. A remarkable urban environment in which it is possible to find, and study, a large number of such organizations is the city of Montreal, in the Quebec Province of Canada, which constitutes an excellent reference to track the onset and the evolution of independent artist-run spaces, and to understand why, how and to what extent they are currently experiencing new pressures and challenges, both on the internal and external sides. This article offers an empirical study of these organizations with reference to their organizational, managerial and strategic vision, and to co-operative interaction and network building practices. It contributes to the field of research on cultural management through its study of the effects of management systems on the strategic action of independent visual arts organizations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Artist-run centres; Management of non-profit organizations; Montreal; Quebec; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Batia S., Artist-run galleries: A contemporary institutional change in the visual arts, Qualitative Sociology, 2, pp. 3-28, (1979); Bellavance G., Bernier L., Laplante B., Le Conditions Pratique Des Artistes En Art Visuels, (2005); Bennet T., The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics, (1995); Boime A., Entrepreneurial patronage in nineteenth-century France, Enterprise and Entrepreneurs In Nineteenth- and Twentieth-century France, pp. 137-207, (1976); Boime A., America's purchasing power and the evolution of European art in the late nineteenth century, Salons, Galleries, Museums, and Their Influence In the Development of Nineteenth-and Twentieth-century Art, pp. 123-139, (1981); Boime A., A Social History of Modern Art: Art In An Age of Revolution, 1750-1800, 1, (1990); Boime A., A Social History of Modern Art: Art In An Age of Bonapartism, 1800-1815, 2, (1993); Boime A., Art In An Age of Counter-revolution (1815-1848), (2004); Boime A., Art In An Age of Civil Struggle 1848-1871, (2008); Bourdieu P., The Field of Cultural Production, (1993); Burt J.E.H., The Visual Arts Market In the Tri-state Area For Canadian Art Galleries, (2003); Byrne N., Carroll B., Ward M., Artists Co-operatives and Their Potential to Contribute to the Development of The Visual Art Sector In Ireland; Cecilli E., Tremblay D.-G., Il distretto del cinema e dell'audiovisivo di Montreal, Tafter Journal; Chang E., Lalonde A., Lloyd C., Loft S., Middleton J., Roy J., Sivanesan H., Decentre, Concerning Artists-run Centre, (2007); Craske W., Art In Europe 1700-1830: A History of the Visual Arts In An Era of Unprecedented Urban Economic Growth, (1997); de Marchi N., van Miegroet J.V., The history of art market, Handbook of the Economics of Art and Culture, pp. 69-122, (2006); de Vertauil G., The changing landscapes of southwest Montreal, The Canadian Geographer, 48, pp. 76-82, (2004); Dossi P., Hype!

In this article the author outlines the roots of what has been called the corporate reform in education and its effects on the arts, poverty, and disabilities. The financial contributions of the Gates and Broad foundations led to the corporatization and nationwide implementation of President Obama and Education Secretary Duncan’s Race to the Top. Teachers’ autonomy and intellectual freedom to craft their own curriculum, tests, and assessments are relinquished to the “experts” and testing companies such as Pearson. The author describes how this reform has consequently marginalized the arts and exacerbated the inequities of poverty and disabilities. These populations flourish when engaged in autonomous acts of discovery, experimentation, and hypothetical thinking, all antithetical to the new reform. Rather, passive submission to expository teaching is an inevitability of teaching to the test. © 2014, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","disability; poverty; standards; testing; visual arts","","","","","","Common Core State Standards; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","Published in 2010, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) initiative for school reform is funded by the richest private foundations in the country—primarily the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Broad Foundation— which wield their influence over Obama and Arne Duncan’s polices. The CCSS is also backed by the most powerful federal agencies in education, including the National Governors Association (NGA) Center for Best Practices, Achieve, Inc., the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and the U.S. Department of Education. The states have been coerced into adopting the standards through federal grants and, most recently, No Child Left Behind waivers. Without adequate testing in schools, parental support, or the consultation of educators and school administrators, the CCSS are poised for implementation in most states in 2013–2014.","Ackerman D., The natural history of the senses, (1991); Au W., What's a nice test like you doing in a place like this?: The edTPA and corporate education “reform, Rethinking Schools, 27, 4, (2013); Berliner D., Our impoverished view of educational reform, Teachers College Record, 108, 6, pp. 949-995, (2006); Chapman L.H., Report cards from hell on the near horizon: High stakes and ridiculous expectations, Paper presented at the National Art Education Association National Convention, Seattle, Washington, March; Chapman L.H., The circular reasoning theory of school reform: Why it is wrong, Paper presented at the Ohio Art Education Association State Conference, Cincinnati, Ohio, November 8; Coleman D., Truant from school: History, science and art, (2012); Coleman D., Guiding principles of the arts K–12, (2012); The arts and the common core: A review of connections between the common core state standards and the national core arts standards conceptual framework., (2012); Mission statement, (2012); Why knowledge matters; The trouble with the Common Core, Rethinking Schools, 27, 4, (2013); About edTPA; Henley D., Working with the young outsider artist: Appropriation, elaboration, and building self narrative, Art education beyond the classroom: Pondering the outsider and other sites of learning, pp. 7-30, (2012); Hirsch E.D., Cultural literacy: What every American needs to know, (1988); Hourigan R., Race to the Top: Implications for professional development in art education, Arts Education Policy Review, 112, pp. 60-64, (2011); Jennings J., Reflections on a half-century of school reform: Why have we fallen short and where do we go from here, (2012); Kohn A., Asking core questions about common core standards: The latest version of top-down reform, Paper presented at the State University of New York at New Paltz, April 25; Kozol J., The shame of the nation: The restoration of apartheid schooling in America, (2005); Krashen S., Ohanian S., High tech testing on the way: A 21st century boondoggle?, Teacher Education Week, (2011); Lustig D.C., Strauser D.R., Causal relationships between poverty and disability, Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin, 50, 4, pp. 194-202, (2007); McTighe G., Wiggins J., Understanding by design, (2005); Meier D., NCLB and democracy, Many children left behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act is damaging our children and our schools, pp. 66-78, (2004); Munson L., Truant from school: History, science and art, (2012); National core arts standards: A conceptual framework for arts learning, (2013); Paul A.M., Relax, it's only a test, (2013); Peterson B., What should children learn?: A teacher looks at E.

String players have the highest risk, with rates of performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) of 65% to 88%. Playing the violin or viola requires complex neuromusculoskeletal skills, and the high frequency of repetitive movements, dynamic and static muscle load, awkward postures, poor technique, and practice time are factors causing musculoskeletal strain. In ergonomic terms, these disorders can be categorized based on extrinsic and intrinsic loads. Identification of intrinsic loads, such as muscle utilization and joint motion, is necessary to understand factors influencing musculoskeletal disorders associated with violin playing. The aim of this study was to review the literature on musculoskeletal demands in violin and viola playing. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, COCHRANE, and CINAHL electronic databases from 1999 to 2015 using the search terms violin, viola, high strings, movement, posture, and synonyms. A manual search of Medical Problems of Performing Artists was also conducted. Additional references were identified by searching the citations and reference lists of all identified relevant studies. RESULTS: The results suggest that an asymmetric playing posture, the associated muscle activity, and joint mobility may contribute to musculoskeletal problems in violin and viola players. Evidence suggests an increased load of intrinsic factors in violin/viola performance. CONCLUSION: The identification of intrinsic loads in violin and viola playing may facilitate the development of prevention strategies and interventions. © 2018 Science & Medicine. www.sciandmed.com/mppa.","","Back Injuries;

Research has suggested that the arts can have positive effects in terms of physical and mental health for people with a dementia. The present study sought to identify the impact of art-making and art-viewing activities, within the context of a publicly accessible art gallery, on verbal fluency and memory. Thirteen participants diagnosed with early to midstage dementia participated, along with their caregivers, in 8-week long art-viewing and art-making groups at an art gallery in the United Kingdom. Audio recordings of sessions were transcribed and analyzed using quantitative content analysis. Findings suggested that the interventions described did not negatively affect cognitive ability in the dimensions measured and the data hints that improvements are possible. The results provide support for further controlled studies examining the impact of visual art, aesthetics, and art-gallery-based programs on cognition in people with dementia. Further research is required to address the methodological limitations presented in the current study.","Aesthetics; Art gallery; Cognition; Dementia; Language; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Dementia 2013 ideographic, (2013);

It is customary to regard gender roles and representation in 19th-century Spain as polarised and predictable. But in this volume, scholars from the United Kingdom and the United States discuss not only the patriarchal emphasis of Spanish culture, but also demonstrate that this was a period in which relations between men and women were being constantly negotiated, challenged, and redefined as part of an ongoing transformation of political and national identities. Contributions look at women's writing and the representation of women in canonical texts, the construction of both femininity and masculinity, issues of race and region, and popular fiction, journalism, and the visual arts.

To understand the present—or the future—support of visual artists, one needs to understand the past. Accordingly, the article begins with a brief history of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1946, discussing Thatcher's reforms after the 1979 election. Tony Blair's New Labour continued many of the same strategies instituted by the Conservatives. At the same time as fiscal constraints and ""enterprise culture"" were imposed, the mission of the Arts Council was broadened to include both geographical representation and a more populist agenda. A review of the contemporary arrangements for state support of artists in the United Kingdom shows that many of the tensions that exist within today's Arts Council were institutionalized in its early days. The article concludes with a comment on what the current situation may portend for the future. © 2008 Heldref Publications.","Arts Council of England; Cultural policy; State funding of the arts; United Kingdom; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Alexander V.D., Enterprise culture, International Encyclopedia of Organization Studies, pp. 445-446, (2007); Alexander V.D., Rueschemeyer M., Art and The State: The Visual Arts in Comparative Perspective, (2005); Colin Tweedy, Chief Executive of Arts and Business, Comments [On Blair’s Speech at Tate Modern], (2007); Ambitions for the Arts: 2003-2006, (2003); Annual Review: 2006, (2006); Turning Point: A Strategy for the Contemporary Visual Arts in England, (2006); 2005-2006 Grant-In-Aid Listing.

METHODS: Students were taught how to evaluate the possible risks associated with the practice of their instruments. They were provided with information about the most frequent medical problems of musicians, warm-up habits, postural hygiene, effective prevention strategies, and different treatment options for these pathologies. The students were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (n=56) who did not take the course and was evaluated with a questionnaire at the beginning of the academic year and 1 year later, and an experimental group (n=90) who did take the course and was evaluated with three questionnaires (at the beginning of the course, 6 months later, and 12 months after the start of the course). RESULTS: While the students in the experimental group improved their body awareness by 91% and the frequency of their injuries decreased by 78%, there was no improvement in the students from the control group at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of course and show that such courses should be included in the academic curriculum of superior conservatories. © 2013 Science & Medicine.","","Adult; Attitude to Health; Female; Health Promotion; Health Status; Humans; Male; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Music; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Pain; Questionnaires; Spain; Students; Young Adult; adult; article; controlled study; equipment; female; health promotion; human; hygiene; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal injury; musician; performing arts; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; risk; Spain; student; warm up; young adult; attitude to health; controlled clinical trial; health promotion; health status; methodology; musculoskeletal disease; music; occupational disease; occupational exposure; pain; psychological aspect; student","","","","","","","Lockwood A.H., Medical problems in musicians, N Engl J Med, 320, pp. 221-227, (1989); Spahn C., Hildebrandt H., Seidenglanz K., Effectiveness of a prophylactic course to prevent playing-related health problems of music students, Med Probl Perform Art, 16, pp. 24-31, (2001); Barton R., Feinberg J.R., Effectiveness of an educational program in health promotion and injury prevention for freshman music majors, Med Probl Perform Art, 23, pp. 47-53, (2008); Zander M.F., Voltmer E., Spahn C., Health promotion and prevention in higher music education (results of a longitudinal study, Med Probl Perform Art, 25, pp. 54-65, (2010); Brandfonbrener A.G., Joint anxiety and arm pain in a large clinical sample of musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, pp. 113-115, (2002); Parry C.B., Prevention of musicians' hand problems, Hand Clin, 19, pp. 317-324, (2003); Zaza C., Research-based prevention for musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 9, pp. 3-6, (1994); Chesky K.S., Downson W.J., Manchester R., Health promotion in schools of music: Initial recommendations for schools of music, Med Probl Perform Art, 21, 3, pp. 142-144, (2006); Spaulding C., Before pathology: Prevention for performing artists, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 135-139, (1988); Lockwood A.H., Medical problems in secondary school-aged musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 129-132, (1988); Blackie H., Stone R., Tiernan A., An investigation of injury prevention among university piano students, Med Probl Perform Art, 14, 3, pp. 141-149, (1999); Hoppann R.A., Patrone N.A., A review of muscle-skeletal problems in instrumental musicians, Semin Arthritis Rheum, 19, pp. 117-126, (1989); Fry H.J., Overuse syndrome in musicians-100 years ago: An historical review, Med J Austr, 145, pp. 620-625, (1996); Fry H.J., Incidence of overuse syndrome in the symphony orchestr, Med Probl Perform Art, 1, pp. 51-55, (1986); Hafer-Crane G.A., Repetitive stress and strain injuries: Preventive exercises for the musician, Phys Med Rehabil Clin, 17, pp. 827-842, (2006); Williamon A., Thompson S., Awareness and incidence of health problems among conservatoire students, Psychol Mus, 34, 4, pp. 411-430, (2006); Hildebrandt H., Nubling M., Providing further training in musicophysiology to instrumental teachers: Do their professional and preprofessional students derive any benefit?, Med Probl Perform Art, pp. 141-149, (1999); Spahn C., Strukely S., Lehmann A., Health conditions, attitudes toward study, and attitudes toward health at the beginning of university study: Music students in comparison with other student populations, Med Probl Perform Art, 19, pp. 26-33, (2004); Dupuis M., Pathologies of the musculo-skeletal system in musicians, Union Med Can, 122, pp. 432-436, (1993); Storm S.A., Assessing the instrumentalist interface: Modifications, ergonomics and maintenance of play, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am, 17, pp. 893-903, (2006); Lluch A., Tendinitis y otras lesiones por sobrecarga en la extremidad superior, Quodlibet, pp. 108-113, (1997); Culf N., Musicians' Injuries, (1998); Sarda E., Araolaza M., Rumbau J., Vilaro J., Impacto De La Prevención En La Calidad De La Interpretación Musical; Hafer-Crane G.A., Repetitive stress and strain injuries: Preventive exercises for the musician, Phys Med Rehabil Clin, 17, 4, pp. 827-842, (2006); Farias Martinez J., Rosety Plaza M., Carrasco Molinillo M.C., Tratamiento No Quirúrgico Del R.S.I.

Musicians begin instrument lessons in early childhood, when the ego and talent are developing simultaneously In these vulnerable years and at any age, music teachers and schools can inhibit the creativity, musical and personal growth, and careers of their students by various common attitudes: e.g., overemphasis on improving technique and winning competitions, stress on prestigious performance careers, denial of the psychological implications of playing-related injury; or failure to promote other professional outlets in music as well as other professions. Sometimes, a musician's career plans are altered or aborted altogether. The author advocates the establishment of psychological and physical interdisciplinary programs and courses m the curriculum as important aspects of healthy music programs as well as career services programs to assist students with both performance and non-performance careers.","","article; attitude; career; childhood; competition; creativity; curriculum; decision making; ego; emotion; human; instrument; interdisciplinary education; music; musician; occupation; performance; performing arts; psychological aspect; psychology; school; stress; student; teacher","","","","","","","","J.

DSD is a process model for supporting the implementation of digital storytelling activities within the broader framework of social and international development projects. DSD blends storytelling, visual arts and digital media to make a difference for vulnerable children, including children with special needs, and in development and integration projects. Vulnerable and special needs children often experience difficulties in communication with adults and peers, both as language difficulties and as inability to focus on personal feelings and thoughts, and consequently to express them properly. Removing such barriers is one of the main goals of special and social educational projects, and a key step towards integration and personal development. Digital storytelling offers an opportunity to tackle the issue, and DSD provides guidelines for implementing projects in this context by focusing on fiction, engaging all stakeholders and providing a high degree of flexibility. The paper presents DSD, and illustrates it with real cases, discusses its evaluation, and indicates ways to adapt it to different project settings. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","communication difficulties;

It combines with an earlier 5-year review, published in 2003 and covering 1997 to 2001, to review the last 10 years' literature in performing arts medicine. From a total of 8,412 references dating back more than 200 years, 2,030 were found in the study period. Nearly 85% of these were written in English, with French and German language articles comprising more than 87% of the rest. Within the study group, there were 1,438 music medicine references (70.8%) and 458 for dance medicine (22.6%). Scientific journals and books were the source of more than 62% of all articles, with five performing arts medicine journals accounting for more than 40% of these. However, pertinent references were found in 381 different periodicals, as well as in a variety of textbooks. Of all arts-related periodicals, those pertaining to voice and dance were most likely to contain health-related articles. Variations in the total number of references, sources of references, and frequency of specific topics occurred from year to year, and from the first study period to the second. These often can be attributed to publication of journals containing multiple abstracts from a meeting or journals with papers on a single topic - often derived from one symposium. Based on a comparison of the two 5-year reporting periods, these statistics will continue to vary as new entries are added in future years. The data from this investigation should be useful to both researchers and clinicians in performing arts medicine, regarding both the sources of pertinent information and the authors and topics currently being published.","","dancing; human; medical literature; occupational medicine; performing arts; publication; retrospective study; review; scientific literature; voice","","","","","","","Harman S.E., Bibliography for occupational diseases of instrumental musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 2, 4, pp. 155-162, (1987); Harman S.E., Bibliography for occupational diseases of instrumental musicians - update, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, 4, pp. 163-165, (1988); Dawson W.J., The bibliography of performing arts medicine: A five-year retrospective review, Med Probl Perform Art, 18, 1, pp. 27-32, (2003); Gilbert L.M., Books on musicians' health, part one, Bass World, 27, 3, pp. 43-44, (2004); Gilbert L.M., Books on musicians' health, part two, Bass World, 28, 1, pp. 43-44, (2004); Solomon R., Solomon J., Publications in dance medicine and science, Med Probl Perform Art, 19, 4, pp. 167-169, (2004); Zinn M., Applied psychophysiology and performing arts: A brief synopsis and an annotated bibliography, Biofeedback, 30, 3-4, pp. 36-38, (2002); Behar A., Wong W., Kunov H., Risk of hearing loss in orchestra musicians: Review of the literature, Med Probl Perform Art, 21, 4, pp. 164-168, (2006); Williams N.R., Occupational groups at risk of voice disorders: A review of the literature, Occup Med, 53, pp. 456-460, (2003); Hartog M., Smith J., Zujko A., Acetabular labral tears in the dancer: A literature review, J Dance Med Sci, 10, 1-2, pp. 51-56, (2006); Bernardo L.M., Nagle E.F., Does Pilates training benefit dancers?: An appraisal of Pilates literature research, J Dance Med Sci, 10, 1-2, pp. 46-50, (2006); Cockey L., Kalmanson K., Annotated bibliography on musician wellness, Am Music Teach, 51, 6, pp. 30-43, (2002); Cockey L., Kalmanson K., Annotated bibliography on musician wellness, Am Music Teach, 52, 6, pp. 34-49, (2003); Cockey L., Kalmanson K., Annotated bibliography on musician wellness, Am Music Teach, 53, 6, pp. 28-41, (2004); Cockey L., Kalmanson K., Annotated bibliography on musician wellness, Am Music Teach, 54, 5, pp. 48-57, (2005); Cockey L., Kalmanson K., Annotated bibliography on musician wellness, Am Music Teach, 55, 6, pp. 28-38, (2006); complete list of articles, Brass Bull 2003, 124, pp. 108-115, (1971); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, 1, pp. 54-55, (2002); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, 4, pp. 181-182, (2002); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 18, 2, pp. 85-87, (2003); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 19, 1, pp. 47-49, (2004); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 20, 1, pp. 56-58, (2005); Harman S.E., Performing arts medicine and the Web, Med Probl Perform Art, 21, 1, pp. 39-41, (2006)","W.J.

We asked two questions: (a) Is criminal activity in San Diego particularly acute at peep show establishments compared to surrounding control locations? and (b) Is criminal activity in San Diego disproportionately greater at or near peep show establishments between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. compared to other times of the day? The levels of crime activity and the expenditure of police resources were examined by measuring the number of calls-for-service (CFSs) to the police within a 1,000-ft. area on either side of the peep show establishments and comparably-sized control areas beyond the immediate 1,000-foot area. A more focused ""late-night"" (2 a.m. to 6 a.m.) analysis was also undertaken. The results showed no reliable evidence of differences in crime levels between the control and test areas, nor was there any evidence of disproportionately greater amounts of crime within the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. time period in the areas surrounding the peep show establishments. We concluded that San Diego does not have a problem with crime at the peep show establishments generally, nor is there a heightened problem with crime during the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. period. We discuss the implications of assuming that peep show establishments are associated with negative effects in the community and the possibility of viewpoint discrimination against sex communication.","","amusement; article; criminal behavior; government; human; incidence; performing arts; police; prostitution; religion; sexual crime; United States","","","","","","","Anselin L., Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, (1988); Bailey L., Moore T.F., Bailer B.A., An interviewer's variance study of the national crime study city sample, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 73, pp. 16-23, (1978); Bartky S.L., Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression, (1990); Biderman A.D., Lynch J.P., Understanding Crime Statistics: Why the UCR Diverges from the NCS, (1991); Black D.J., Production of crime rates, American Sociological Review, 35, pp. 733-748, (1970); Brooks G.R., The Centerfold Syndrome: How Men Can Overcome Objectification and Achieve Intimacy with Women, (1995); Bursik Jr. R.J., Grasmick H.G., The use of multiple indicators to estimate crime trends in American cities, Journal of Criminal Justice, 29, pp. 509-516, (1993); Bursik Jr. R.J., Crasmick H.G., Chamlin M.B., The effect of longitudinal arrest patterns on the development of robbery trends at the neighborhood level, Criminology, 28, pp. 431-450, (1990); Campbell D.T., Stanley J.C., Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research, (1963); Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis-An Analysis, (1984); Study of the Effects of the Concentration of Adult Entertainment Establishments in the City of Los Angeles, (1977); Relation of Criminal Activity and Adult Businesses, (1979); Adult Business Study: Impacts in Late Evening/Early Morning Hours, (1994); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (2nd Ed.), (1988); Secondary Effects [Online], (2004); Edwards S.S.M., Selling the body, keeping the soul: Sexuality, power, the theories and realities of prostitution, Body Matters: Essays on the Sociology of the Body, pp. 89-104, (1993); Erdfelder E., Paul F., Buchner A., G*POWER.

Methods: The qualitative study used individual structured interviews to assess the impacts of arts programming on job satisfaction, stress, unit culture, support, quality of care, and patient outcomes on a short-term medical-surgical unit, and used a qualitative cross comparison grounded theory methodology to analyze data. Results: The study confirmed that arts programming can positively affect unit culture, nursing practice, and quality of care on short-stay medical-surgical units. Significant insights related to nursing practice and the art program were found, including that music can cause negative distraction for staff. Conclusions: While positive impacts of arts programming on the medical-surgical environment are clear, potential negative effects also need to be considered in the development of practice protocols for artists. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

A periodicity of voice appears responsible for these special effects. Acoustic signals were recorded for selected portions of dramatic singing in order to study the acoustic effects of delicate voice control by a master of the Konparu school. Using a signal analysis-synthesis algorithm, TANDEM-STRAIGHT, to represent multiple candidates for pitch perception, signals deviating from the harmonic structure have been successfully displayed, corresponding to auditory impressions of pitch movements, even when narrow-band spectrograms failed to show the perceived events. Strong interaction between vocal tract resonance and vocal fold vibration seems to play a major role in producing these expressive voice qualities. © Informa UK Ltd.","Aperiodicity; Inharmonicity; Noh; Pitch; TANDEM-STRAIGHT; Time-frequency analysis; Voice quality; XSX","Algorithms; Art; Auditory Perception; Emotions; Humans; Japan; Language; Male; Phonation; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound Spectrography; Speech Acoustics; Vibration; Voice; Voice Quality; amplitude modulation; article; computer analysis; frequency modulation; hearing; human; Japan; performing arts; priority journal; singing; speech analysis; vocal cord; voice; algorithm; art; emotion; language; male; phonation; signal processing; sound detection; speech; vibration","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; International Institute for Asian Studies, IIAS","The current team of researchers as collaborators in this work was organized as a study group on Voice: Acoustic Characteristics and Emotional Expression of Speech (Principal Investigator: Osamu Fujimura), constituting part of a larger research project on Wide Range Interdisciplinary Issues Accompanying Advanced Science and Technology, at the International Institute for Advanced Studies (IIAS), Kyôto, Japan, supported, in part, by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science during the fiscal years 2006–2008.

The medium has evolved to such a degree that evaluation should not rest on whether an individual game can be considered art, but what types of aesthetic engagement the medium affords. A key figure in the study of the visual arts is aesthetic contemplation, in which extended attention reveals aesthetic differences. Although the video game presents many sites and scenes worthy of such contemplation, this mode of spectatorship requires sufficient time and space to attend to a visual object. In order to open up a space for aesthetic engagement, many of the ludological and narrative demands of the game must recede. In this article, we will investigate the degree to which players have choice in how, or how long, they attend to a game’s visual environment. © The Author(s) 2020.","aesthetic pace; aesthetic perception; immersive environments; video games; visual arts","","","","","","","","Anderson J.D., Toward an ecology of the arts, Psychocinematics: Exploring cognition at the movies, pp. 76-93, (2014); Arp J., Torse des pyrenées, (1962); Atkinson P., Why pause?

The general problem that we raise in the article is whether this pessimistic picture of the relation between state control, market influence, and artistic work is relevant for studying the performing arts today. The study is primarily based upon twenty-seven qualitative interviews with informants in an institutional theatre and a symphony orchestra. We conclude that the actors in the Theatre are trapped-not so much within ""a bureaucratic iron cage""-but rather within ""an iron cage of charismatic leadership,"" while the musicians in the Orchestra enjoy the relative freedom and democratic power of a rather soft bureaucratic organization. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bureaucracy; charisma; iron cage; performing arts","","","","","","","","Andersen S., Case-studier og generalisering, Forskningsstrategi Og Design, (1997); Barker C., Cultural Studies: Theory and Practice, (2004); Beck U., The Brave New World of Work, (2000); Becker H., Art Worlds, (1982); Bjorkas S., Det Muliges Kunst.

These latter changes are associated with the use of mathematics, but mathematicians had a long tradition of relying upon words not images in the transmission of ideas. In the mathematical sciences we find important changes in content but striking conservatism in visual style. For instance in explaining his perspective construction (c. 1465-70), Piero della Francesca uses non-perspectival pictorial conventions in his diagrams. Leonardo da Vinci's perspective drawings of polyhedra (c. 1498) were apparently conceived as substitutes for actual models. Nevertheless, the period from about 1500 to 1650 saw a notable increase in the provision of decorative illustrations.","","Astronomy; Biographies; Contracts; Geometry; Imaging techniques; Mathematical programming; Object recognition; Printing; Technical writing; Text processing; Illustrations; Mathematical sciences; Psychologists; Visual arts; Visual communication","","","","","","","Euclid, The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, 1, (1956); Francesca P.D., De Prospectiva Pingendi, (1942); Field J.V., Piero della Francesca: A Mathematician's Art, (2004); Field J.V., The Invention of Infinity: Mathematics and Art in the Renaissance, (1997); Alberti L.B., On Painting and 'on Sculpture', (1972); Baxandall M., Alberti's cast of mind, Words for Pictures: Seven Papers on Renaissance Art and Criticism, pp. 27-38, (2003); Field J.V., Piero della Francesca; Field J.V., Rediscovering the Archimedean polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler, Archive for History of Exact Sciences, 50, pp. 241-289, (1997); Wood C.S., The perspective treatise in ruins: Lorenz Stoer's Geometria perspectiva, 1567, The Treatise on Perspective: Published and Unpublished, pp. 235-257, (2003); Field J.V., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra; Descartes R., Correspondence, pp. 228-229, (1940); Field J.V., Gray J.J., The Geometrical Work of Girard Desargues, pp. 176-177, (1987); Field J.V., The Invention of Infinity; Field J.V., Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology, (1988); Apparatus to Set Astronomy on a Firm Footing","","","","","","","","","03080188","","","","English","Interdiscip.

Arts-Based Research appeared in 1993, driven by Elliot Eisner, as an intensification of the aesthetic qualities of educational research processes and outcomes. It has developed bringing human and social sciences research closer to artistic creation (despite epistemological positions, such as those of H. Gardner, which bluntly separate the arts from science). Its fundamental characteristic is the use of ideas and forms of representation provided by the arts to do research. One of the methodological modalities of Arts-Based Research is A/r/tography, which appeared in 2003 driven by Rita Irwin, as a coherent and balanced unification of artistic, educational and research purposes. Its fundamental methodological concepts are vital inquiry, metaphors and metonymies, reverberations and the search for meaning in the combination of texts and images. Both Arts-Based Research and A/r/tography used any artistic specialty (dance, literature, music, theatre, visual arts, etc.), therefore become the meeting zone between qualitative methodological innovations in human and social sciences, and the community based and participatory trends of contemporary art, such as 'Artivism'. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

String instrumentalists, like many orchestra musicians, can spend hours with head postures that may influence the biomechanical behavior of the TMJ and the muscles of the craniocervicomandibular complex (CCMC). The adoption of abnormal postures acquired during performance by musicians can lead to muscular hyperactivity of the head and cervical muscles, with the possible appearance of TMD. Medical infrared thermography is a non-invasive procedure that can monitor the changes in the superficial tissue related to blood circulation and may serve as a complement to the clinical examination.

METHODS: Cephalometric analysis was obtained after carrying out three lateral cephalograms using a standardized radiographic technique. The first one was taken with the teeth in the normal occlusion and the lips relaxed, the second with the oboe embouchure, and the last was performed with the English horn. To understand the pressures involved during the embouchure and musical performance of the English horn and oboe, a system was developed using force sensors placed on the double-reed mouthpiece. Finally, infrared imaging was used to better understand the anatomy-physiology of specific structures of the cranio-cervico-mandibular complex. RESULTS: Cephalometry of the musician showed more significant changes in the retrusion of the mandibular pogonion. The embouchure pressures measured during musical practice showed that the English horn induced a higher pressure on the lower lip than on the upper, while the inverse happened with the oboe. Thermography confirmed the painful site on the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and this was also observed in the muscle tenderness/discomfort on the right superficial masseter by the differential temperature of these areas. CONCLUSION: Techniques such as lateral teleradiography, infrared imaging, and force sensors can be useful screening tools with added value for the diagnosis of TMDs in performing artists. © 2018 Science & Medicine.","","Cephalometry; Facial Muscles; Humans; Music; Pilot Projects; Posture; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders; Thermography; Article; cephalometry; clinical examination; craniofacial morphology; face; force; human; human experiment; infrared photography; jaw disease; jaw radiography; lip; male; mandible; mandibular central incisor; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; maxilla; morphological trait; musician; normal human; performing arts; pilot study; pressure; temperature; temporomandibular joint; thermography; tooth; tooth occlusion; body position; cephalometry; diagnostic imaging; face muscle; music; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; signal processing; temporomandibular joint disorder","","","","","LAETA/INEGI; Portuguese National Funding Research Agency, (UID/EMS/50022/2013); UISPA; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","Supported by UISPA (LAETA/INEGI) and FCT (Portuguese National Funding Research Agency) under the project FCT UID/EMS/50022/2013.

Many artists, mostly women but also a few men, stepped down from art for religious reasons. Some of them even started to preach against art because they considered their former profession haram. The 'repentance' of so many famous performers led to fierce contestations in the media. Art became an issue par excellence for debating notions of the 'common good' and the 'good Muslim.' Media were intensively used by secularists, conservative Muslims, Islamists, the regime and repentant artists to publicise their version of Islam. The different voices in the debate are analysed to investigate whether they constitute a counterpublic. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Egypt; Gender; Islamic Revival; Performing arts; Repentance","","","","","","","","Abaza M., Changing Consumer Cultures of Modern Egypt, Cairo's Urban Reshaping, (2006); Abu Lughod L., The marriage of feminism and Islamism in Egypt: Selective repudiation as a dynamic of postcolonial cultural politics, Remaking Women, pp. 243-270, (1998); Abu Shadi A., The Influence of Terrorism and Extremism on Official Governmental Censorship Over the Cinema and Television in Egypt, (1994); Brooks G., De Dochters Van Allah, (1998); Eickelman D.F., Anderson J.W., Redefining Muslim publics, New Media in the Muslim World.

Our findings challenge assumptions underpinning much of the literature on dual leadership; in particular, the assumption that conflict is inevitable between the two leaders. In our research, we identified dual leadership relationships that might more accurately be described as instances of collaborative leadership. We suggest that one explanation for this presence of collaborative leadership may be that the study found similarities in both leaders’ passion for the arts, often reflected in a shared background in an arts practice. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Collaboration; collaborative leadership; conflict; dual leadership; interdependency; performing arts","","","","","","","","Alvarez J.L., Svejenova S.S., Sharing Executive Power: Roles and Relationships at the Top; Archer D., Cameron A., Collaborative Leadership: How to Succeed in an Interconnected World; Auvinen T., Why is it Difficult to Manage an Opera House?

Integrating agency and resource dependence theory, the authors develop a taxonomy of board profiles for opera houses and test the impact of both individual profiles and board diversity on the performance of Italian Lyric Symphonic Foundations (LSFs). They posit that different profiles will affect theatres’ revenue structure differently, as each profile drives specific types of revenue, such as earned income, private funds and public funds. In order to empirically test their hypotheses, they perform a panel data analysis with fixed-effects and bootstrap resampling (N = 5,000) and robust clustered errors around theatres over an 11-year period (2001-12). While the literature stresses the crucial role of all board members in orienting an organization’s performance, these new findings show the importance of different board profiles in affecting LSF revenue structure. The authors conclude that the board of directors can and should be mobilized to ensure the organization’s growth. © 2018 École des Hautes Études Commerciales (HEC), Montréal.","Board composition; Board diversity; Cultural policy; Performing arts; Theatre performance","","","","","","","","Agid P., Tarondeau J., Governance of major cultural institutions: The case of the Paris Opera, International Journal of Arts Management, 10, 1, pp. 4-18, (2007); Agid P., Tarondeau J., The Management of Opera: An International Comparative Study, (2010); Alexander V., Pictures at an exhibition: Conflicting pressures in museums and the display of art, American Journal of Sociology, 101, 4, pp. 797-839, (1996); Auvinen T., Why is it difficult to manage an opera house?

Few studies have focused specifically on the health concerns of musicians in Malaysia. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate playing-related health problems among student musicians at a university in Malaysia as well as their knowledge and awareness of playing-related health problems. METHODS: Instrumental music students enrolled in undergraduate and post-graduate university music courses (n=98) participated in a self-report online survey which addressed aspects such as educational background, playing experience, knowledge and awareness of musicians' health issues, history of physical problems, lifestyle factors, and prevention and management strategies. RESULTS: Of the total participants, 28.9% reported that they were currently experiencing playing-related pain in a body part, and 46.4% had experienced playingrelated pain at some time. More than half (56.7%) felt that they have not received enough information or advice on playing-related health during their current studies. Musicians who experienced playing-related pain, tension, and discomfort reported the main problem sites to be the fingers and hands, arms, neck, and shoulders. CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrate that Malaysian university music students are affected by similar types of playing-related physical problems as their counterparts around the world. A greater awareness and knowledge of injury prevention and management strategies is needed so that these music students can sustain healthy playing careers. © 2016 Science & Medicine.","","Adolescent;

Nonetheless, senior high schools (SHSs) in rural and urban schools follow the same curriculum, and their students write the same West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE), which qualifies them to access higher education in Ghana’s public universities. Urban SHSs are also recognized nationwide as good schools where students make it to university. Moreover, performance patterns with regard to admission of SHS graduates into university also vary between rural and urban schools; consequently, some parents do everything to get their children in urban SHSs, even consenting to placement in visual arts, a program deemed appropriate only for academically weak students. This study therefore adopted the qualitative-quantitative research approach with interview, observation, and questionnaire administration to investigate the critical factors that affect academic performance of SHS students, particularly those in visual arts as case study. Findings from six public SHSs in Kumasi—two each in rural, peri-urban, and urban areas—revealed that urban schools perform better than rural and peri-urban schools because they attract and admit junior high school graduates with excellent Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) grades, have better infrastructure, more qualified teachers, prestigious names, and character that motivate their students to do well. This suggests that bridging the rural–urban gap in educational resources could promote quality teaching and learning, and thereby raise academic achievement for SHS students in Ghana. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","academic performance; Ghana; rural–urban disparity; senior high school; visual arts","","","","","","","","Adedeji S.O., Olaniyan O., Improving the conditions of teachers and teaching in rural schools across African countries, (2011); Adedeji S.O., Owoeye J.S., Teacher quality and resource situation as determinants of students academic achievement in Ogun state secondary schools, Journal of Educational Management, 4, pp. 36-45, (2002); Adesemowo P.O., Premium on affective education: A panacea for scholastic malfunctioning and aberration, (2005); Adinyira S., Perceptions and attitudes about the Senior High School Visual Arts Programme and their influence on students in the Kumasi Metropolis, (2012); Agbenatoe W.G., Improving the teaching and learning of General Knowledge in Art using multiple intelligences lesson plans, (2011); Agyenim-Boateng C., The use of learning support assistants in visual arts education in Ghana: A case study in Al-Azhariya school for Islamic ideology Junior high School, Kumasi, (2011); Anamuah-Mensah J., The new education reform, (2002); Ankomah A.Y., The success story of private basic schools in Ghana: The case of three schools in cape coast, Journal of Educational Management, 4, pp. 1-4, (2002); Aremu O.R., Sokan B.O., A multi-causal evaluation of academic performance of Nigeria learners: Issues and implications for national development, (2003); Armah A.N., Contextualising the underperformance of rural education in Northern Ghana: Management approach, International Journal of ICT and Management, (2013); Armstrong T., Multiple intelligences in the classroom, (2009); Asihene G.N., The role of core subject teachers in the academic performance of visual arts students in Ghanaian senior high schools, (2009); Atuahene F., Owusu-Ansah A., A descriptive assessment of higher education access, participation, equity, and disparity in Ghana, SAGE Open, (2013); Babatunde M.M., Olanrewaju M.K., Class size and school climate as correlates of secondary school students’ scholastic achievement in Itesiwaju Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria, Global Journal of Human Social Science: G Linguistics & Education, 14, 3, pp. 14-21, (2014); Banson F., A comparative study of practical skills development in textiles and general knowledge in art in selected schools in Ashanti and Brong Ahafo Regions of Ghana, (2010); Bell J.M., Define academic performance, (2012); Coultas J., Lewin K., Who becomes a teacher?

Mappe per Affetti Erranti allows multiple users to interact with the music piece at several levels. On the one hand, multiple users can physically navigate a polyphonic music piece, actively exploring it; on the other hand they can intervene on the music performance modifying and molding its expressive content in real-time through full-body movement and gesture. An implementation of Mappe per Affetti Erranti was presented in the framework of the science exhibition “Metamorfosi del Senso”, held at Casa Paganini, Genova, in October – November 2007.

A review was conducted to identify all relevant literature to help researchers and clinicians gain an enhanced understanding of dancesport. Eight databases were searched, with 34 articles found in topics including participation motives, psychology, exercise physiology, fitness training, injuries and injury prevention, biomechanics, menstrual dysfunction, and substance use. Our results indicate that researchers have been inconsistently recording and reporting anthropometric and dancesport data; for example, 31 studies separated participants by gender, 21 included the competition classification of dancers, 19 reported which style of dancesport participants competed in, and 13 described the participants as a dance couple. Common injuries affected the neck, shoulder, spine, knee, lower leg, and foot. Dancesport is in the very heavy to extremely heavy category in energy expenditure (mean heart rate: male 175.2 ± 10.7, female 178.6 ± 8.6 bpm) and utilizes both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems. Alphabeta and heart rate variability intervention techniques are reported to successfully enhance performance in dancers. Dancesport participants also appear less likely to smoke cigarettes, but have little knowledge about anti-doping rules. During events, professionals danced farther (30 m) and faster (0.3 m/sec) than junior dancers. Female competitors were more likely to be eumenorrheic. Dancesport is a physically and mentally demanding competitive sport, but there is a need to standardize measurements in future studies to allow comparison. © 2013 Science & Medicine.","","Athletic Injuries; Competitive Behavior; Dancing; Female; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Physical Endurance; Stress, Physiological; Wounds and Injuries; accident prevention; article; biomechanics; bone mass; bone metabolism; competition; dancesport; dancing; doping; energy expenditure; exercise physiology; heart rate variability; human; low back pain; medical research; menstruation disorder; neurofeedback; oxygen consumption; performing artist; performing arts; physical performance; psychology; radiculopathy; smoking; smoking cessation; sport; sport injury; sports medicine; substance use; systematic review; United Kingdom; United States; competitive behavior; endurance; female; injury; male; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiological stress; physiology; review; skeletal muscle; sport injury","","","","","","","International DanceSport Federation, (1997); Stretch R., The ""strictly"" effect, Dance Today, (2008); (2011); (2011); (2011); Arunas B., Katusha D., Take 1st in professional ballroom -Blackpool dance festival 2011, Ballroom Today, (2011); (2011); (2011); (2011); (2011); (2011); Dancesport federation of serbi, DSFS, (2011); Hincapie C.A., Morton E.J., Cassidy J.D., Musculoskeletal injuries and pain in dancers: A systematic review, Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 89, pp. 1819-29, (2008); Bria S., Bianco M., Galvani C., Et al., Physiological characteristics of elite sport-dancers, J Sports Med Phys Fitness, 51, pp. 194-203, (2011); Motta-Valencia K., Dance-related injury, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am, 17, pp. 697-723, (2006); Kostic R., Zagorc M., Uzunovic S., Prediction of success in sports dancing based on morphological characteristics and functional capabilities, Acta Univ Palacki Olomuc Gymn, 34, pp. 59-64, (2004); VonFreye E., Mergenthaler K., Response of blood sugar, electrolytes, and osmolality in ballroom dancers, Dtsch Zeitschr Sportmed, 34, pp. 61-3, (1983); Vontraut P.H., Heck H., Hollmann W., On circulatory stress in competitive ballroom dances during training and in competition, Sportarzt Sportmed, 27, pp. 31-6, (1976); DallaVedova D., Besi M., Cacciari D., Et al., Un approccio biomechanico di tipo cinematico allo studio della danza sportiv, Med Dello Sport, 59, pp. 375-86, (2006); Faina M., Bria S., Simonetto L., La danza sportiv, Med Dello Sport, 58, pp. 137-50, (2005); Steltenpohl D., Winkler G., Nutritional situation of german top ballroom dancers, Ernahr-Umsch, 50, pp. 137-41, (2003); Nieminen P., Participation profiles and socialisation into dance among non-professional dancers, Sport Educ Soc, 2, pp. 221-34, (1997); Nieminen P., Motives for dancing among finnish folk dancers, competitive ballroom dancers, ballet dancers and modern dancers, Eur J Phys Educ, 3, pp. 22-34, (1998); Nieminen P., Varstala V., Finnish dancers' attitudes toward folk, competitive ballroom, ballet, and modern dance, Dance Res J, 31, pp. 63-79, (1999); Rohleder N., Beulen S., Chen E., Et al., Stress on the dance floor: The cortisol stress response to social-evaluative threat in competitive ballroom dancers, Pers Soc Psychol Bull, 33, pp. 69-84, (2007); Strahler J., Berndt C., Kirschbaum C., Rohleder N., Aging diurnal rhythms and chronic stress: Distinct alteration of diurnal rhythmicity of salivary amylase and cortisol, Biol Psychol, 84, pp. 248-56, (2010); Blanksby B., Reidy P., Heart rate and estimated energy expenditure during ballroom dancing, Br J Sports Med, 22, pp. 57-60, (1988); Faina M., Bria S., Scarpellini E., Et al., The energy cost of modern ballroom dancing.

He has placed artistic experiments with sensory fusion outside the domain of synesthesia research. Artistic experiments, though historically interesting, are considered irrelevant for the study of synesthesia. Contrary to this view I argue that at least Scriabin's and Kandinsky's artistic experiments were based on involuntary experiences of synesthesia. They were investigating perceptual and emotional mechanisms of involuntary synesthetic experiences that meet Cytowic's criteria of synesthesia. Artistic experiments are not only historically interesting, but may also contribute to present synesthesia research.","Music; Perception; Psychology; Synesthesia; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Cytowic R.E., Synesthesia, phenomenology & neuropsychology: A review of current knowledge, Psyche, 2, 10, (1995); Cytowic R.E., The Man Who Tasted Shapes, (1993); Cytowic R.E., Synesthesia: A Union of the Senses, (1989); Gage J., Colour and Culture: Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction, (1993); Gombrich E.H., Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, (1960); Hahl-Koch J., Kandinsky, schoenberg und der ""Blaue Reiter, Vom Klang der Bilder [on the Sound of Pictures], pp. 354-359, (1985); Kandinsky W., Marc F., The Blaue Reiter almanac, Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art, pp. 229-233, (1912); Kandinsky W., On the spiritual in art, Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art, 1-2, pp. 114-220, (1912); Kandinsky W., Reminiscences, Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art, (1913); Kandinsky W., Report to the pan-Russian conference, 1920, Kandinsky: Complete Writings on Art, (1921); Kemp M., The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, (1990); Marks L.E., The Unity of the Senses: Interrelations among the Modalities, (1978); Messiaen O., Music and Color: Conversations with Claude Samuel, (1993); Myers C., A case of synaesthesia, British Journal of Psychology, 6, pp. 228-232, (1914); Peacock K., Synesthetic perception: Alexander Scriabin's color hearing, Music Perception, 2, pp. 483-506, (1985); Peacock K., Instruments to perform color-music: Two centuries of technological instrumentation, Leonardo, 21, pp. 397-406, (1988); Von Hornbostel E.M., Ueber geruchshelligkeit, Pfluegers Archiv fuer die Gesamte Physiologie, 227, pp. 517-538, (1931); Van Campen C., Early abstract art and experimental Gestalt psychology, Leonardo, 30, pp. 133-136, (1997); Van Campen C., Artistic and Psychological Experiments with Synesthesia, (1997)","C.

In Study 1 we induced a negative mood in participants by showing them a sad film clip and then assigned them to one of two conditions. In the venting condition they were asked to draw something related to the film; in the distraction condition they were asked to draw an image unrelated to the film (a house). In Study 2 we induced a negative mood by asking participants to think of the saddest event they had experienced and then assigned them to one of three conditions: venting, distraction, and sitting - a new condition in which participants just sat quietly. This latter condition allowed us to assess the effect of passage of time. In both studies, positive and negative affect were measured before and after the assigned activity.

This often extends to measuring an organization's artistic excellence, or, in Australian terms, ""artistic vibrancy"". In some countries, such as England and Australia, funding bodies require major arts organizations to ""self-assess"" their own artistic excellence and vibrancy. But can such a thing really be measured? In 2009, the Australia Council for the Arts conducted research into the concept of measuring artistic vibrancy. As there had been little formal research in the area, the Australia Council conducted primary research into what might represent ""good practice"" in artistic self-assessment amongst major performing arts organizations in Australia and the United Kingdom, in the art forms of opera, orchestral and chamber music, dance and theatre (including circus). The researchers' key finding was that there is no ""one size fits all"" approach to assessing artistic vibrancy. Arts organizations will adopt a variety of methods that suit their unique environments, both across art forms and within them. However, in general, it was found that good practice in artistic self-assessment almost always involved: a frank culture of feedback, within the organization, and with audiences and external stake holders; a meaningful engagement with assessment as part of a performance improvement process, and a related aversion to ""box ticking""; a genuine commitment to peer review; and acting on the outcomes of artistic selfassessment to improve future work. This article will examine the Australian policy context of the research, review the literature in relation to measuring ""artistic vibrancy"", and present key, good practice case studies of ""artistic self-assessment"", including the Royal Opera House and Scottish Opera, United Kingdom, and Circus Oz, Australia. The article will conclude with an analysis of the findings from the case studies, and suggestions for further research and policy directions for other funding bodies grappling with the issue of how to measure artistic vibrancy. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Artistic assessment; Australia; Britain; Performing arts","","","","","","Quality Framework; Scottish Arts Council","The Scottish government employs independent, expert assessors to review the artistic standards of Scottish “national performing companies”.2 The Scottish Arts Council also has a “Quality Framework” for its funded arts organizations which they can use in their self-assessment and to develop their applications for funding.

Image analysis techniques are applied in order to detect and identify the fingertips on a video. Scale and rotation invariance techniques are also applied. The finger gesture recognition and prediction is based on the stochastic modelling of the extracted high-level features with the help of hidden Markov models and Gaussian mixture models. The applications concern directly the finger gesture control of sound in performing arts. The proposed system can be considered in the long term as an intangible musical instrument that implies 'everyday gestures' and reduces the gap between non-musicians or blind people and music.

New “indigenizing” methodologies centre the production of knowledge around the processes and knowledges of indigenous communities. Creative research methods involving artistic practices—such as photovoice, journaling, digital storytelling, dance, and theatre—may have a place within these new approaches, but their applications have yet to be systematically explored. We conducted a scoping review of 36 international research studies literature on arts-based research with indigenous peoples. The majority of studies used photovoice and were conducted in Canada, USA, Australia, or New Zealand. We identify five primary fields in which arts-based methods may offer benefit to an indigenous research agenda: (a) participant engagement, (b) relationship building, (c) indigenous knowledge creation, (d) capacity building, and (e) community action. We propose several opportunities to further explore arts-based methods with indigenous peoples. © The Author(s) 2018.","arts-based methods; community engagement; indigenizing methodologies; scoping review; visual arts","","","","","","","","Adair J.G., Puhan B.N., Vohra N., Indigenization of psychology: Empirical assessment of progress in Indian research, International Journal of Psychology, 28, pp. 149-169, (1993); Adams K., Burns C., Liebzeit A., Ryschka J., Thorpe S., Browne J., Use of participatory research and photo-voice to support urban Aboriginal healthy eating, Health & Social Care in the Community, 20, pp. 497-505, (2012); Archibald J.-A., An indigenous storywork methodology, Handbook of the arts in qualitative research: Perspectives, methodologies, examples, and issues, pp. 371-393, (2008); Arksey H.O., Malley L., Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, pp. 19-32, (2005); Bader R., Wanono R., Hamden S., Skinner H.A., Global youth voices: Engaging Bedouin youth in health promotion in the Middle East, Canadian Journal of Public Health, 98, pp. 21-25, (2007); Baldwin A., Applied theatre: Performing the future, Australasian Psychiatry, 17, pp. S133-S136, (2009); Blodgett A.T., Coholic D.A., Schinke R.J., McGannon K.R., Peltier D., Pheasant C., Moving beyond words: Exploring the use of an arts-based method in Aboriginal community sport research, Qualitative Research in Sport, Exercise and Health, 5, pp. 312-331, (2013); Blodgett A.T., Schinke R.J., McGannon K.R., Coholic D.A., Enosse L., Peltier D., Pheasant C., Navigating the insider-outsider hyphen: A qualitative exploration of the acculturation challenges of Aboriginal athletes pursuing sport in Euro-Canadian contexts, Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 15, pp. 345-355, (2014); Boydell K.M., Gladstone B.M., Volpe T., Allemang B., Stasiulis E., The production and dissemination of knowledge: A scoping review of arts-based health research, Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung (Forum: Qualitative Social Research), 13, (2012); Castellano M.B., Ethics of Aboriginal research, International Journal of Indigenous Health, 1, pp. 98-114, (2004); Castleden H., Garvin T., Modifying photovoice for community-based participatory Indigenous research, Social Science & Medicine, 66, pp. 1393-1405, (2008); Coemans S., Hannes K., Researchers under the spell of the arts: Two decades of using arts-based methods in community-based inquiry with vulnerable populations, Educational Research Review, 22, pp. 34-49, (2017); Couture J., Couture R., McGowan V., The metaphoric mind: Selected writings of Joseph Couture, (2013); Crotty M., The foundations of social research: Meaning and perspective in the research process, (1998); Daniels D., Using the life histories of community builders in an informal settlement to advance the emancipation and development of women, The Cyril O.

It is posited that adding value and ensuring satisfaction may enhance consumer loyalty, and therefore, the likelihood of sales and continued subscriptions may be increased. The purpose of this paper is to examine bundling as a marketing management technique for opera companies and hypothesises that offering attractive “package deals” that bundle various benefits with the seat ticket may increase participation and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: A discrete choice experiment with opera patrons is used to evaluate the application of bundling to improve increased demand and loyalty. Findings: It is concluded that offering bundles creates a greater likelihood of customer satisfaction and favourable behavioural intentions, which may lead to increased loyalty. Participants expressed strong support for value-added elements. Such package deals included a variety of elements: opportunity for a visit backstage to meet the cast, informative introductions to operas and facilitated parking options. Consumers’ level of overall willingness to purchase a bundle was altered based on the attributes that made up that bundle. The findings of this research confirm that the theory of bundling can be applied to arts marketing and provides support for the development of bundling strategies to enhance opera attendance. Research limitations/implications: It is recognised that the research needs to be tested in different countries in order to know the extent to which the findings of this study can be generalised. Additionally, future research could use other statistical methods such as regression and structural equation modelling to holistically model behaviour. Finally, as well as testing customer-stated intentions, the model also needs to be tested with actual patronage behaviour following the development and application of bundling strategies. Future research could also consider how bundling and other aspects relating to opera attendance could be used as part of the branding strategy associated with opera attendance; in particular how to develop, increase and maintain loyalty and therefore brand resonance in opera attendees. Practical implications: The findings have useful implications for event organisers and policymakers and suggest bundling strategies that could be utilised. It is has been found that loyalty can be enhanced by adding value and ensuring satisfaction, and therefore, increase the likelihood of sales and repeat purchase. Social implications: Opera represents a significant cultural heritage and is a valuable component of the performing arts, both historically and currently. Opera is a form of art whose survival is threatened by an increasingly diminished audience whose average age is steadily increasing. This decrease in audience attendance has led to radical changes in the management and marketing of opera houses, where theaters have moved increasingly towards a business-oriented model where improved branding and bundling strategies can be utilised. Originality/value: This makes a theoretical contribution by advancing performing arts research and furthering the notion that bundling can increase the likelihood of opera attendance, satisfaction, ongoing loyalty, and also addresses a managerial need of an arts marketing organisation. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bundling; Choice analysis; Loyalty; Membership; Opera; Performing arts","","","","","","Opera Australia; Australian Research Council, ARC; Deakin University","The authors gratefully acknowledge research funding for this study from the Australian Research Council and Opera Australia, grant development provided by Professor Robin Shaw, insights and support provided by Dr Peter Oppenheim and the overall support for the study provided by Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.","Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Baker D.A., Crompton J.L., Quality, satisfaction and behavioural intentions, Annals of Tourism Research, 27, 3, pp. 785-804, (2000); Bakos Y., Brynjolfsson E., Bundling information goods: pricing, profits, and efficiency, Management Science, 45, 12, pp. 1613-1630, (1999); Banciu M., Mirchandani P., Bundling strategies when products are vertically differentiated and capacities are limited, Management Science, 56, 12, pp. 2207-2223, (2010); Batsell R., Louviere J., Experimental choice analysis, Marketing Letters, 2, 3, pp. 199-214, (1991); Baumol W., Bowen W., Performing Arts – the Economic Dilemma: A Study of Problems Common to Theater, Opera, Music and Dance; a Twentieth Century Fund Study, (1981); Bell S., The current audience: Sydney Winter Season 2009, Opera Australia, (2009); Ben-Akiva M., Lerman S.R., Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Applications to Travel Demand, (1985); Bernstein J., Arts Marketing Insights: The Dynamics of Building and Retaining Performing Arts Audiences, (2007); Borgonovi F., Performing arts attendance: an economic approach, Applied Economics, 36, 17, pp. 1871-1885, (2004); Brook O., Reframing models of arts attendance: understanding the role of access to a venue.

The principal, concerned by underperformance on State literacy tests of the school's largely working-class and NESB population, requested David Hornsby and other members of the project team from the Education Faculty at La Trobe University to offer whole-school professional development. The focus was on developing oral language as a foundation for literacy learning, enacting Britton's claim that ""reading and writing float on a sea of talk"". The project team introduced the teachers to a range of innovative classroom practices for using visual and performance arts, literature, music and crafts. Drawing on video, interviews and writing samples, a number of teachers worked collaboratively with the research team to develop case studies of individual students with a range of literacy aptitudes and social skills. A key research question was: ""What do children take from their engagement in arts-based activities into reading of literary texts, and potentially into writing from the perspective of another character?"" In this paper we ponder this from three vantage points: by outlining the informing principles in our research project; confirming insights from current interdisciplinary work about children learning to see, do, act and say in play; and analysing the research data from the initial phase. © 2008.","Arts-based inquiry; Children's literature; Creative arts; Multiliteracies; Pedagogy; Play; Reading; Visual arts; Writing in role","","","","","","","","Barrs M., Cork V., The reader in the writer, (2001); Britton J., Language and learning, (1970); Handbook of research on literacy through the communicative arts (Volume II), (2008); Galton M., Research workshop on classroom observation, (2008); Galton M., MacBeath J., A life in teaching?

The human performer and the computer systems perform computer graphic and computer music interactively in real-time. In general, many sensors are used for the interactive communication as interfaces, and the performer receives the output of the system via graphics, sounds and physical reactions of interfaces like musical instruments. I have produced many types of interfaces, not only with physical/electrical sensors but also with biological/physiological sensors. This paper is intended as an investigation of some special approaches: (1) 16-channel electromyogram sensor called “MiniBioMuse-III” and its application work called “BioCosmicStorm-II” performed in Paris, Kassel and Hamburg in 2001, (2) sensing/reacting with “breathing” in performing arts, (3) 8-channel electric-feedback system and its experiments of “body-hearing sounds” and “body-listening to music”. © 2003, Steering Committee of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression.

Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with patients (n = 20), who were asked to examine a selection of paintings and to choose one to discuss with the interviewer. Results: Ninety percent of participants found the experience to be positive. Thematic analysis of patients' descriptions of their reactions to the paintings reveals multiple beneficial dimensions of spirituality during the illness experience. The findings suggest that the use of images can facilitate conversation and enhance well-being in hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Using narrative images may be a useful spiritual modality for working with hospitalized patients. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","interviewing; mental health; pastoral care; spiritual care;

Recent trends in creativity research point to a domain-specific view challenging the more traditional generalist view. With these trends in mind, the current study assessed creative self-perceptions of 3553 students and community members in 56 different possible domains distributed across five factors (as determined by principal components analysis). African Americans were less likely to fall prone to gender stereotypes in creativity. In addition, African Americans and Native Americans tended to rate themselves as more creative than other ethnicities. Specific trends in the factors and implications for future research are discussed.

In order to prevent MPA from happening or to alleviate it when it occurs, a review of the literature about its prevention and treatment was done. Forty-four articles, meeting evidence-based medicine (EBM) criteria, were identified and analyzed. Performance repertoire should be chosen based on the musician's skill level, and it should be practiced to the point of automaticity. Because of this, the role of music teachers is essential in preventing MPA. Prevention is the most effective method against MPA. Several treatments (psychological as well as pharmacological) have been studied on subjects in order to determine the best treatment for MPA. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) seems to be the most effective, but further investigation is desired. Some musicians, in addition to CBT, also take β-blockers; however, these drugs should only be prescribed occasionally after analyzing the situation and considering the contraindications and possible side effects. Despite these conclusions, more randomized studies with larger, homogeneous groups of subjects would be desirable (according to the EBM criteria), as well as support for the necessity of both MPA prevention and optimized methods of treatment when it does occur.","","Adolescent;

In this paper the primary aim is to examine, in the light of empirical results from a research project in which the authors are presently engaged, three main, and rival, positions that have been taken up in this debate, here labelled as the ‘homology’, the ‘individualization’ and the ‘omnivore–univore’ arguments. Elsewhere, we have concentrated on musical consumption in England, and find evidence that is broadly supportive of the omnivore–univore argument. Here we ask whether such findings are confirmed in the case of theatre, dance and cinema attendance. A secondary aim of the paper is to bring to the attention of practitioners in the field of cultural policy and administration the need to address the issues that arise through the use of more powerful methods of data analysis than those often applied in the past. We explain how indicators of theatre, dance and cinema attendance derived from the Arts in England survey of 2001 can be subject to analysis so as to reveal two distinctive patterns of attendance and, in turn, two distinctive types of consumer—who can, it turns out, be regarded as omnivores and univores, even if with some qualification. The former have relatively high rates of attendance at all kinds of the events covered, including musicals and pantomimes as well as plays and ballet, while the latter tend to be cinema-goers only, that is, non-consumers of theatre and dance. A range of measures of social inequality are then introduced into the authors' analyses, including separate measures of social class and social status and also of educational level and income, and it is further shown that, again in conformity with the omnivore–univore argument, these two types of consumer are socially stratified. Omnivores are of generally higher social status than univores and also have usually higher levels of education and higher income than do univores (the latter finding marking the main difference with musical consumption, which was unaffected by income once other stratification variables were controlled). In sum, our results for theatre, dance and cinema attendance lend, overall, further support to the omnivore–univore argument as against its rivals, but also indicate that different aspects of social inequality impact on different forms of cultural consumption in varying degrees and probably through largely separate processes. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural Consumption; Performing Arts; Social Stratification","","","","","","","","Bauman Z., Freedom, (1988); Berlyne D., Studies in the new experimental aesthetics: Steps toward an objective psychology of aesthetic appreciation, (1974); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, (1984); Chan T.W., Goldthorpe J.H., Is there a status order in contemporary British society?

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PRMDs among instrumentalists in South Africa, with specific objectives in determining the distribution, symptoms, and pain severity. The self-administered Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used to collect information from the participants regarding the lifetime and current prevalence and the distribution of PRMD symptoms. A visual analog scale was used to collect information on the severity of pain, while the questionnaire designed by Blackie, Stone, and Tiernan (1999) was used to collect information on the symptoms of the PRMDs. Twenty participants took part in this study, and the respondents reported a lifetime prevalence (over a period of 12 months) of PRMDs as 14 out of 17 and the current prevalence (in the last 7 days) as 4. Pain severity was mostly mild, and the most affected region was in the upper extremities, with the shoulders being the most affected. Tightening and soreness were the most reported symptom of PRMDs. The prevalence of PRMDs among this population was high, although severity was mild, with the upper extremities being the most affected area. © 2013 Science & Medicine.","","Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Music; Neck; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; South Africa; Upper Extremity; adult; arm; article; clinical article; cross-sectional study; female; human; lifespan; male; musculoskeletal disease; pain assessment; performing arts; prevalence; South Africa; symptomatology; visual analog scale; young adult; age distribution; aged; middle aged; music; neck; occupational disease; occupational exposure; pathophysiology; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; sex ratio; South Africa; statistics","","","","","","","Abreu-Ramos A., Micheo W., Lifetime prevalence of upper-body musculoskeletal problems in a professional-level symphony orchestra: Age, gender and instrument specific results, Med Probl Perform Art, 22, 3, pp. 97-104, (2007); Buckley T., Manchester R., Overuse injuries among non-classical recreational instrumentalists, Med Probl Perform Art, 21, pp. 80-87, (2006); Sadeghi S., Kazemi B., Shooshtari S.M., A high prevalence of cumulative trauma disorders in iranian instrumentalists, BMC Musculoskelet Disord, 5, 35, pp. 1-5, (2004); Fry H., Prevalence of overuse (injury) syndrome in australian music schools, Br J Ind Med, 44, pp. 35-40, (1987); Zaza C., Charles C., Muszynski A., The meaning of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders to classical musicians, Soc Sci Med, 47, 12, pp. 2013-2023, (1998); Blackie H., Stone R., Tiernan A., An investigation of injury prevention among university piano students, Med Probl Perform Art, 14, 3, pp. 141-149, (1999); Antonopoulo M.D., Alegaki A.K., Hadjipavlou A.G., Lionis C.D., Studying the association between musculoskeletal disorders, quality of life and mental health: A primary care pilot study in rural crete, greece, BMC Musculoskelet Disord, 10, (2009); Kaufman-Cohen Y., Ratzon N., Correlation between risk factors and musculoskeletal disorders among classical musicians, J Occup Med, 61, 2, pp. 90-95, (2011); Davies J., Manginon S., Predictor of pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms among professional instrumental musicians: Elucidating specific effect, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, pp. 155-168, (2002); Kumar R., Research Methodology.

Part of the work was dedicated to augmenting a stage in a live performance, with dance as an application case. In this paper, we present a milestone of this work, an augmented dance show that brings together several tools and technologies that were developed over the project's lifetime. This is the result of mixing an artistic process with scientific research and development. This augmented show brings to stage issues from the research fields of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) and Augmented Reality (AR). Virtual elements are added on stage (visual and audio) and the dancer is able to interact with them in real-time, using different interaction techniques. The originality of this work is threefold. Firstly, we propose a set of movement-based interaction techniques that can be used independently on stage or in another context. In this set, some techniques are direct, while others go through a high level of abstraction. Namely, we performed movement-based emotion recognition on the dancer, and used the recognized emotions to generate emotional music pieces and emotional poses for a humanoid robot. Secondly, those interaction techniques rely on various interconnected systems that can be reassembled. We hence propose an integrated, interactive system for augmenting a live performance, a context where system failure is not tolerated. The final system can be adapted following the artist's preferences. Finally, those systems were validated through an on field experiment-the show itself-after which we gathered and analyzed the feedback from both the audience and the choreographer. © 2012 IEEE.","augmented dance; Augmented reality; emotion recognition; interaction for performing arts","Anthropomorphic robots; augmented dance; Emotion recognition; High level of abstraction; Human-machine interaction; Interaction techniques; Movement-based interactions; Performing arts; Tools and technologies; Augmented reality","","","","","","","Alaoui S.F., Caramiaux B., Serrano M., Bevilacqua F., Movement qualities as Interaction modality, Proceedings the 2012 International Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS'12), pp. 11-15, (2012); Boutin L., Biomimétisme : Génération de Trajectoires Pour la Robotique Humanoïde À Partir de Mouvements Humains, (2009); Caplier A., Bonnaud L., Chassery J.-M., Robust fast extraction of video objects combining frame differences and adaptative reference image, IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, (2001); Castellano G., Villalba S., Camurri A., Recognising human emotions from body movement and gesture dynamics, Proc.

It investigates India's diversified cultural base - language and literature; religion and spirituality; visual and performing arts; philosophy, science, and economics; and India's role in Asia. The volume also discusses the relationship between the state and market, the debates regarding cultural preservation, harmonious aspects of Indian culture, the role of administration and the government agencies. This book integrates the two ideas - the uniqueness of India with a developed culture but a developing economy and the recent trend of considering culture as a factor in determining the status of a nation in the world after market and military strength. Providing a wide-ranging view of the various dimensions of culture, it explores the interconnections of culture with the social and political life in India. © Oxford University Press 2009.

Their claims for inclusion led to questioning the closed character of the Western art world. This critique of the closed nature of the Western art scene and of the exclusionary structures of Western aesthetic valuation has been articulated and dealt with on two analytically different, but empirically intertwined levels: cultural policy and the art institutes. Both the redefinition of the cultural policy and the reorganisation of the field of art itself have been accompanied by-sometimes passionate-public debates. The article takes the city of Amsterdam as the unit of analysis, as the city hosts a rich variety of ethno-cultural communities and is characterised by a large and flourishing cultural apparatus. Of course, the developments enacted in the city of Amsterdam are not unique. They are one particular articulation of dynamics occurring on different scales: global, national and regional. My analysis is restricted to the domain of high culture, and focuses on two subfields: the visual arts and theatre performances. For the purpose of this article, the field of high art is of special interest as it is surrounded by a complex set of-mostly implicit-rules and mechanisms that regulate entry. These mechanisms, which affect different groups unevenly, have become the subject of major critique.","Amsterdam; Cultural policy; Diversity; Interculturalism; Performing arts; Visual arts","Amsterdam [North Holland]; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North Holland; Western Europe; art; cultural tradition; esthetics; immigrant population; multiculturalism; social exclusion; social inclusion","","","","","","","Alkema H., De veelkoppige sprong naar het theaterbolwerk, Een Kleurend Podium.

Through a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews and documentary research, they gathered information on two cases in the performing arts (dance): Jacaranda and Ancizar Velsquez. Both cases show how entrepreneurs can focus on cultural traditions that are not local. It is possible to track their success through the foreign dances offered in their own country and traditional dances offered to a foreign audience. The authors conclude that cultural organizations can gain a competitive advantage by introducing artistic products in a foreign context where they will be perceived as exotic and autochthonous. A practical implication of this work is that artists and cultural organizations may exploit what is perceived as an exotic tradition and as a consequence strengthen cultural industries and preserve cultural traditions.","Case study; Exoticism; Geographic paradox; Performing arts","","","","","","","","Aldaz M., Rojo F., Moscoso D., Novoa C., Soler S., Lauschus A.M., Jimenez Mosquera J., Memorando de Donantes, Industrias Culturales, Motor de Desarrollo Socioeconómico de Cali, (2009); Alonso J.C., Gallego A.I., Rios A.M., Industrias Culturales de Santiago de Cali: Caracterización y Cuentas Económicas, (2010); Alonso J.C., Rios A.M., Concentración de la Producción de las Industrias Culturales en Cali, Estudios Gerenciales, 27, 119, pp. 99-121, (2010); Alonso J.C., Rios A.M., Gonzalez J.F., Clustering Dynamics Within the Cultural Industries in Cali, Colombia, (2013); Aoyama Y., The role of consumption and globalization in a cultural industry: The case of Flamenco, Geoforum, 38, 1, pp. 103-113, (2007); Aravamudan S., Response: Exoticism beyond cosmopolitanism?, Eighteenth Century Fiction, 25, 1, pp. 227-242, (2012); Bagozzi R.P., Kyu-Hyun L., Consumer resistance to, and acceptance of, innovations, Advances in Consumer Research, 26, 1, pp. 218-225, (1999); Becker H., The power of inertia, Qualitative Sociology, 18, 3, pp. 301-309, (1995); Bose S., Ponnam A., Country of origin effect on services: An evaluation of entertainment, Managing Leisure, 16, 2, pp. 98-107, (2011); Cappetta R., Manzoni B., Salvemini S., Value drivers for cultural events: Empirical evidence from Italy, International Journal of Arts Management, 12, 2, pp. 4-16, (2010); Chang S.-C., Dancing with Nostalgia in Taiwanese Contemporary Traditional Dance, (2011); Dastous A., Voss Z.G., Colbert F., Caru A., Caldwell M., Courvoisier F., Product-country images in the arts: A multi-country study, International Marketing Review, 25, 4, pp. 379-403, (2008); Guercini S., Ranfagni S., Defining market approaches in cultural organizations: An analysis of Italian theatres, Arts Marketing, 2, 1, pp. 52-69, (2012); Hahn T., Sensational Knowledge: Embodying Culture Through Japanese Dance, (2007); Hosokawa S., Salsa no Tiene Fronteras: Orquesta de la Luz and the globalization of popular music, Situating Salsa: Global Markets and Local Meanings in Latin Popular Music, pp. 259-287, (2002); Kasriel-Alexander D., The top ten consumer trends for 2013, Euromonitor International: News and Resources, (2013); Kleijnen M., Lee N., Wetzels M., An exploration of consumer resistance to innovation and its antecedents, Journal of Economic Psychology, 30, 3, pp. 344-357, (2009); Lampel J., Lant T., Shamsie J., Balancing act: Learning from organizing practices in cultural industries, Organization Science, 11, 3, pp. 263-269, (2000); Nagashima A., A comparison of Japanese and US attitudes toward foreign products, Journal of Marketing, 34, 1, pp. 68-74, (1970); Peteraf M.A., The cornerstones of competitive advantage: A resource-based view, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 3, pp. 179-191, (1993); Pier D., The branded arena: Ugandan traditional"" dance in the marketing era, Africa, 81, 3, pp. 413-433, (2011); Cali: La capital Mundial de la Salsa, La Respuesta Es Colombia 2013, (2010); Ram S., Sheth J.N., Consumer resistance to innovations: The marketing problem and its solutions, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 6, 2, pp. 5-14, (1989); Roman-Velasquez P., The making of salsa music scene in London, Situating Salsa: Global Markets and Local Meanings in Latin Popular Music, pp. 259-287, (2002); Siggelkow N., Persuasion with case studies, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 1, pp. 20-24, (2007); Tai J.A., Changes and dance, International Journal of the Humanities, 3, 2, pp. 131-138, (2005); Throsby D., Cultural capital, Journal of Cultural Economics, 23, 1-2, pp. 3-12, (1999); Throsby D., Cultural capital, The Handbook of Cultural Economics, pp. 166-169, (2003); System of national accounts, Technical Report, United Nations 1993-2008, (2008); Yi-Long J., Chun-Liang C., Shi C., Managing innovation in the creative industries: A cultural production innovation perspective, Innovation: Management, Policy and Practice, 14, 2, pp. 256-275, (2012); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2003); Zukauskaite E., Innovation in cultural industries: The role of university links, Innovation: Management, Policy and Practice, 14, 3, pp. 404-415, (2012)","","","Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales","","","","","","14808986","","","","English","Int.

It analyzes whether their problems are playing-related or if various parameters potentially influence their health state, and it subsequently presents a concept of efficient training. Health disorders and diseases are individual. In order to ensure efficient prevention, a profile of qualification, including physical and psychological aspects as well as key skills, allows developing an individual training schedule and thus should be included in the process of prevention. Physical performance plays a decisive role and is more important than commonly thought. Strength, endurance, and flexibility in particular have an immense influence on the musician's performance. Playing an instrument requires both physical and mental skills, and all too often this leads to excessive demands. It is necessary to highlight the possible causes and provide the musician with a therapeutic intervention and educational work. As the demand for preventative work in this field grows steadily, this paper draws a detailed concept of a therapeutic intervention.","","Environmental Monitoring; Hand Injuries; Health Status; Humans; Motor Activity; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Music; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Task Performance and Analysis; Weight-Bearing; Workload; backache; body posture; bone deformation; cycling; endurance; endurance training; ergometer; health status; human; instrument; isometric exercise; joint mobility; limb disease; low back pain; mental performance; motor activity; motor coordination; muscial intrument; muscle exercise; muscle stiffness; muscle strength; muscle stretching; muscle tone; musculoskeletal disease; musculoskeletal function; musician; neck muscle; occupational therapy; performing artist; performing arts; physical performance; physiotherapy; psychological aspect; psychomotor activity; rotator cuff injury; running; short survey; sitting; skill; static exercise; stretching exercise; swimming; tendinitis; tennis elbow; tenosynovitis; thorax pain; training; walking","","","","","","","Samsel W., Moller H., Muller R., Ergebnisse einer Befragung junger Musiker über Berufsperspektiven, Belastungen und Gesundheit, Zeitschr Musikphysiol Musikermed, 13, 3, pp. 86-98, (2006); Larrson L.G., Baum J., Mudholkar G., Kollia G., Nature and impact of musculoskeletal problems in a population of musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 8, 3, pp. 73-76, (1993); Molsberger F., Der Künstler Als Patient: Eine Untersuchung Über Erkrankungen des Bewegungsapparates Bei Orchestermusikern, (1994); Zaza C., Farewell V.T., Musicians' playing-related musculoskeletal disorders: An examination of risk factors, American Journal of Industrial Medicine, 32, 3, pp. 292-300, (1997); Lederman R., Neuromuscular and musculoskeletal problems in instrumental musicians, Muscle Nerve, 27, 5, pp. 549-561, (2003); Caldron P., Calabrese L., Clough J., Et al., A survey of musculoskeletal problems encountered in high-level musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 1, 4, pp. 136-139, (1986); IMBA- Integration Von Menschen Mit Behinderungen in Die Arbeitswelt, (1996); Borg G., Borg's Perceived Exertion and Pain Scales, (1998); Kloppel R., Das Gesundheitsbuch fur Musiker, (2003); Brandfonbrener A., Epidemiologie berufsspezifischer Erkrankungen bei Musiker, Medizinische Probleme Bei Musikern, pp. 104-115, (1995); Ackermann B., Adams R., Marschall E., Strength or endurance training for undergraduate music majors at a university?, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, 1, pp. 33-41, (2002)","C.

An important amount of research focuses on the “musicality” of infant-directed speech (defined melodic contours, tonal and rhythm variations, etc.) and its role in linguistic enculturation. However, researchers have recently suggested that adults also bring a multimodal performance to infants. According to this, some scholars seem to find indicators of the genesis of the performing arts (mainly music and dance) in such a multimodal stimulation. We analyze the adult performance using analytical categories and methodologies of analysis broadly validated in the fields of music performance and movement analysis in contemporary dance. We present microanalyses of an adult-7 month old infant interaction scene that evidenced structural aspects of infant directed multimodal performance compatible with music and dance structures, and suggest functions of adult performance similar to performing arts functions or related to them. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Dance; Early interaction; Infant directed speech; Music; Performing arts","Adult; Female; Humans; Infant; Interpersonal Relations; Movement; Music; Speech; Speech Acoustics; adult; female; human; human relation; infant; movement (physiology); music; psychology; speech","","","","","ARGENTINA, (PICT 2097-2008); National Agency for Promoting Scientific and Technological Research","Preparation of this paper was partially supported by a grant from the National Agency for Promoting Scientific and Technological Research, ARGENTINA PICT 2097-2008.

Results show a big presence of young people in public space, with a massive participation of young immigrants coming from the Philippines and South America. Concerning social inclusion, the groups revealed an implicit agreement of space sharing and self-regulation which testify to a predisposition to openness with others. The real acknowledgment of diversity, which is a specificity of interculturalism, occurs only under particular circumstances: during the performer-spectator relationship, and when practitioners belonged to the same disciplines.

VR panoramas are immersive anamorphoses rendered from equirectangular spherical perspective data. This data is usually photographic, but some artists are creating hand-drawn equirectangular perspectives to be visualized in VR. This practice, that lies interestingly at the interface between analog and digital drawing, is hindered by a lack of method, as these drawings are usually done by trial-and-error, with ad-hoc measurements and interpolation of pre-computed grids, a process with considerable artistic limitations. I develop here the analytic tools for plotting all great circles, line images and their vanishing points, and then show how to achieve these constructions through descriptive geometry diagrams that can be executed using only ruler, compass, and protractor. Approximations of line images by circular arcs and sinusoids are shown to have acceptable errors for low values of angular elevation. The symmetries of the perspective are studied and their uses for improving gridding methods are discussed. © 2018, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa.

Books, buildings, objects, spaces, images, and archival sources help to cast light on the practice of religion in the home. Acts of devotion, from routine prayers to extraordinary religious experiences such as miracles and visions, frequently took place at home amid the joys and trials of domestic life-childbirth, marriage, infertility, sickness, accidents, poverty, and death. The book moves beyond traditional research on the Renaissance in important ways. First, it breaks free from the usual focus on Venice, Florence, and Rome to investigate practices of piety across the Italian peninsula. In particular, new research into the city of Naples, the Marche, and the Venetian mainland offers fresh insights into the devotional life of the laity. Moreover, it goes beyond the study of elites to include artisanal and lower-status households, and points to the role of gender and age in shaping religious experience. Drawing on a wide range of textual, material, and visual sources, this book recovers a host of lost voices and compelling narratives at the intersection between the divine and the everyday. Its multidisciplinary approach enables unprecedented glimpses through the keyhole into the spiritual lives of Renaissance Italians © Abigail Brundin, Deborah Howard, and Mary Laven 2018.

Method: Both groups participated in weekly outreach sessions combining object handling and museum visits with arts and craft activities. Using mixed methods, measures of confidence, sociability and well-being were evaluated quantitatively through a “ladder of change” model of steps towards independence and feedback was analysed qualitatively. Results: Comparison of scores from first, mid- and last sessions showed increases across all measures. Qualitative analysis revealed additional gains including pride, learning and skills, and creativity. Findings were interpreted in terms of social capital, independence and resilience. Conclusions: Creative museum activities showed increases in participant levels of confidence, sociability and well-being. The study highlighted the potential of asset-based approaches augmenting research on the value of museum activities to health and well-being © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","inferential statistics; mental health; rehabilitation; thematic analysis; visual arts","","","","","","Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/J500700/1, AH/L012987/1)","","Abbott S., Freeth D., Social capital and health: Starting to make sense of the role of generalized trust and reciprocity, Journal of Health Psychology, 13, pp. 874-883, (2008); Ander E.E., Thomson L.J., Blair K., Lanceley A., Menon U., Chatterjee H.J., Using museum objects to improve wellbeing in psychiatric and rehabilitation patients, British Journal of Occupational Psychology, 76, pp. 208-216, (2013); Ander E.E., Thomson L.J., Lanceley A., Menon U., Noble G., Chatterjee H.J., Heritage, health and wellbeing: Assessing the impact of a heritage focused intervention on health and wellbeing, International Journal of Heritage Studies, 19, pp. 229-242, (2012); Anthony W.A., Recovery from mental illness: The guiding vision of the mental health service system in the 1990s, Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal, 16, pp. 11-23, (1993); Antonovsky A., Unravelling the mystery of health: How people manage stress and stay well, (1987); Best D., Addiction recovery: A handbook, (2012); Boardman J., Friedli L., Recovery, public mental health and well-being, (2012); Burns S., Graham K., MacKeith J., The outcomes star, (2006); Camic P.M., Chatterjee H.J., Museums and art galleries as partners for public health interventions, Perspectives in Public Health, 133, pp. 66-71, (2013); Camic P.M., Tischler V., Pearman C., Viewing and making art together: An eight week gallery-based intervention for people with dementia and their caregivers, Aging & Mental Health, 18, pp. 161-168, (2014); Chatterjee H.J., Vreeland S., Noble G., Museopathy: Exploring the healing potential of handling museum objects, Museum and Society, 7, pp. 164-177, (2009); Chatterjee H., Noble G., Museums, health and well-being, (2013); Cohen J., Statistical power analysis for the behavioural sciences, (1969); Colbert S., Cooke A., Camic P.M., Springham N., The art-gallery as a resource for recovery for people who have experienced psychosis, The Arts in Psychotherapy, 40, pp. 250-256, (2013); Duffy S., Personalisation in Mental Health, (2010); Eekelaar C., Camic P.M., Springham N., Art galleries, episodic memory and verbal fluency in dementia: An exploratory study, Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts, 6, pp. 262-272, (2012); Falk J.H., Identity and the museum visitor experience, (2009); Fereday J., Muir-Cochrane E., Demonstrating rigor using thematic analysis: A hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and theme development, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 5, pp. 80-92, (2008); Foot J., What makes us healthy?

However, the relationship between the geometry of a room and its acoustic efficiency in terms of early energy has rarely been investigated using basic geometrical principles. The present study demonstrates the possibility of predicting the average value of early reflected energy across the audience area using solid angles.

This holds a negative implication for arts festivals, since visitors who purchase tickets tend to stay for longer periods and spend more than visitors not interested in ticketed shows/productions. Ticket sales from audiences are also one of festivals' main sources of income. Targeting the visitors who attend these shows/productions is therefore a viable management goal. The focus of this article is to identify and analyse the key factors that contribute to ticket purchases at selected arts festivals in South Africa in order to provide festival organisers with the necessary insight to develop effective marketing strategies that target their ticket-purchasing market. A factor analysis was performed on the dataset of the two festivals and revealed seven factors; all of the Cronbach's Alpha values were valid. Effect sizes were calculated to determine possible differences between categories pertaining to age and number of days the festival was attended. The results revealed no statistically significant differences and therefore suggest that this market is relatively homogenous. Managerial and marketing implications are consequently proposed for the festival organisers. © 2012, Copyright South African Theatre Journal.","arts festival; arts/theatre demand/attendance; performing arts; ticket purchase behaviour","","","","","","","","Abbe-Decarroux F., The perception of quality and the demand for services: Empirical application to the performing arts, Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization, 23, 1, pp. 99-107, (1994); Akdede S.H., King J.T., Demand for and productivity analysis for Turkish public theatre, Journal of Cultural Economics, 30, 3, pp. 219-231, (2006); Albert S., Movie stars and the distribution of financially successful films in the motion picture industry, Journal of Cultural Economics, 22, 4, pp. 249-270, (1998); Allen J., O'Toole W., McDonnell I., Harris R., Festival and special event management, (2005); Anderson T.D., Getz D., Stakeholder management strategies of festivals, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 199-220, (2008); Anon, The Klein Karoo National Arts Festival: Information and statistics, (2001); Ateca-Amestoy V., Determining heterogeneous behaviour for theatre attendance, Journal of Cultural Economics, 32, 2, pp. 127-151, (2008); Bagella M., Becchetti L., The determinants of motion picture box office performance: Evidence from movies produced in Italy, Journal of Cultural Economics, 23, pp. 237-256, (1999); Baker D.A., Crompton J.L., Quality, satisfaction and behavioral intentions, Annals of Tourism Research, 27, 3, pp. 785-804, (2000); Beaven Z., Laws C., Principles and applications in ticketing and reservations management, Festival and events management: An international arts and culture perspective, pp. 183-201, (2004); Beaven Z., Laws C., Delivering quality in arts events: An operations management perspective, (2005); Beaven Z., Laws C., Loyal customer attitudes towards ticket distribution channels for live music events: A ethnographic exploration of US leg of the Depeche Mode 2005–6 World Tour, Managing Leisure, 12, 2-3, pp. 120-142, (2007); Borgonovi F., Performing arts: An economic approach, Applied Economics, 36, 17, pp. 1871-1885, (2004); Botha K., The development of a ticket purchase behaviour measuring instrument and model for South African arts festivals, (2011); Botha K., Slabbert E., Market segmentation of visitors to Aardklop National Arts Festival: A correspondence analysis, Management Dynamics, 20, 1, pp. 2-18, (2011); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

However, infants' discriminatory and evaluative responses in the domain of the visual arts have, as of today, not been examined. Artistic paintings are complex visual stimuli. Multiple cues such as color, style of brushing, common subjects, and others must be considered to discriminate and evaluate paintings from different artists. The authors examined infants' visual attention to works of 2 painters, namely Picasso and Monet. Results suggest that infants discriminate and categorize different paintings but that they display a spontaneous preference for paintings by Picasso. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Aesthetic processing; Art perception; Categorization; Discrimination; Infancy; Monet; Paintings; Picasso; Visual arts; Visual attention","","","","","","","","Adams R.J., An evaluation of color preference in infancy, Infant Behavior and Development, 10, pp. 143-159, (1987); Allman J.M., Miezin F., McGuinness E., Direction- and velocity-specific responses from beyond the classical receptive field in the middle temporal visual area (MT), Perception, 14, pp. 105-126, (1985); Arterberry M.E., Infants' sensitivity to the depth cue of heightin-the-picture-plane, Infancy, 13, pp. 544-555, (2008); Atkinson J., Wattam-Bell J., Braddick O., Birtles D., Barnett A., Cowie D., Form vs motion coherence sensitivity in infants: The dorsal/ventral developmental debate continues, Journal of Vision, 4, 32, (2004); Banks M.S., Salapatek P., Infant pattern vision: A new approach based on the contrast sensitivity function, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 31, pp. 1-45, (1981); Banks M.S., Shannon E., Spatial and chromatic visual efficiency in human neonates, Visual perception and cognition in infancy, pp. 1-46, (1993); Belke B., Leder H., Harsanyi G., Carbon C., When a Picasso is a ""Picasso"": The entry point in the identification of visual art, Acta Psychologica, 133, pp. 191-202, (2010); Bertin E., Bhatt R.S., Three-month-olds' sensitivity to orientation cues in the three-dimensional depth plane, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 93, pp. 45-62, (2006); Cernoch J.M., Porter R.H., Recognition of maternal auxiliary odors by infants, Child Development, 56, pp. 1593-1598, (1985); Conway B.R., Livingstone M.S., Perspectives on science and art, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 17, pp. 476-482, (2007); Crook C.K., Taste and olfaction, Handbook of infant perception, pp. 237-264, (1987); Franklin A., Bevis L., Ling Y., Hurlbert A., Biological components of colour preference in infancy, Developmental Science, pp. 1-9, (2009); Gazzaniga M.S., Ivry R.B., Mangun G.R., Cognitive neuroscience, The biology of the mind, (2009); Granrud C.E., Yonas A., Infants' perception of pictorially specified interposition, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 37, pp. 500-511, (1984); Granrud C.E., Yonas A., Opland E.A., Infants' sensitivity to the depth cue of shading, Perception & Psychophysics, 37, pp. 415-419, (1985); Hemker L., Granrud C.E., Yonas A., Kavsek M., Infant perception of surface texture and relative height as distance information: A preferential-reaching study, Infancy, 15, pp. 6-27, (2010); Hopkins B.L., Proposed conventions for evaluating observer reliability: A commentary on two articles by Birkimer and Brown, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 12, 4, pp. 561-654, (1979); Imura T., Yamaguchi M.K., Kanazawae S., Shirai N., Otsuka Y., Tomonaga M., Yagi A., Infants' sensitivity to shading and line junctions, Vision Research, 48, pp. 1420-1426, (2008); Jacobsen T., Bridging the arts and sciences: A framework for the psychology of aesthetics, Leonardo, 39, 2, pp. 155-162, (2006); James W., (1890); Kaufman J., Mareschal D., Johnson M.H., Graspability and object processing in infants, Infant Behavior and Development, 26, pp. 516-528, (2003); Kavsek M., Infants' perception of directional alignment of texture elements on a spherical surface, Infant and Child Development, 12, pp. 279-292, (2003); Kellman P.J., Arterberry M.E., Infant visual perception., Handbook of child psycholog, 2, (2006); Knoblauch K., Bieber M.L., Werner J.S., M- and L-cones in early infancy: VEP responses to receptor-isolating stimuli at 4- and 8-weeks of age, Vision Research, 38, pp. 1753-1764, (1998); Kuffler S.W., Discharge patterns and functional organization of mammalian retina, Journal of Neurophysiology, 16, pp. 37-68, (1953); Leder B., Belke H., Oeberst A., Augustin D., A model of aesthetic appreciation and aesthetic judgments, British Journal of Psychology, 95, pp. 489-508, (2006); Leinbach M.D., Fagot B.I., Categorical habituation to male and female faces: Gender schematic processing in infancy, Infant Behavior and Development, 16, pp. 317-332, (1993); Livingstone M., Light vision, Harvard Medical Allumni Bulletin, Autumn, pp. 14-23, (2003); Marr D., Vision.

Despite the growing scientific interest in dance, no standardized psychometric instrument exists to assess people’s dance experience. Here, we introduce the Goldsmiths Dance Sophistication Index (Gold-DSI), a 26-item questionnaire to measure individual differences in participatory and observational dance experience on a continuous scale. The Gold-DSI was developed in 3 stages: In the first stage, a set of 76 items was generated by adapting questions from the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Müllensiefen, Gingras, Musil, & Stewart, 2014) and as part of a stakeholder workshop using a grounded theory approach. The second stage focused on item reduction. Using a large-scale online survey (N = 424), hierarchical factor analysis was used to fit a model comprising of one general and six secondary factors (28 items in total). In Stage 3, six new items were added to specifically capture individual differences in dance observation. We then collected data from two samples for final model estimation (n = 127) and evaluation (n = 190). The final version of the Gold-DSI comprises 26 items; 20 items relate to 1 general factor that captures experience in dance participation. This includes 4 secondary factors: body awareness, social dancing, urge to dance, and dance training. A further 6 items separately measure experience in dance observation. In sum, the Gold-DSI provides a brief, standardized, and continuous assessment of doing, watching, and knowing about dance. © 2020 The Author(s)","Assessment; Dance; Expertise; Individual differences; Performing arts","","","","","","Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/M000680/2); University of Hertfordshire, UH","This study was partially supported by an Early Career Research Grant from the University of Hertfordshire awarded to Dawn Rose and an ESRC transformative research grant on “Synchronous Movement, Cooperation and the Performing Arts” (ES/M000680/2) awarded to Guido Orgs.","Alexias G., Dimitropoulou E., The body as a tool: Professional classical ballet dancers' embodiment, Research in Dance Education, 12, pp. 87-104, (2011); Bentley A., Bentley measures of musical abilities, (1966); Biasing B., The dancer's memory: Expertise and cognitive structures in dance, The neurocognition of dance, pp. 75-98, (2010); Biasing B., Caivo-Merino B., Cross E.

As an oral tradition, its musical dimension is the result of the application of a series of predefined conventions and it offers unique concepts for musicological research. Computational analyses of jingju music are still scarce, and only a few studies have dealt with it from an MIR perspective. In this paper we present the creation of a corpus of jingju music in the framework of the CompMusic project that is formed by audio, editorial metadata, lyrics and scores. We discuss the criteria followed for the acquisition of the data, describe the content of the corpus, and evaluate its suitability for computational and musicological research. We also identify several research problems that can take advantage of this corpus in the context of computational musicology, especially for melodic analysis, and suggest approaches for future work. © Rafael Caro Repetto, Xavier Serra.","","Information retrieval; Computational analysis; Oral tradition; Performing arts; Research problems; Audio acoustics","","","","","European Union?s Seventh Framework Program; European Union’s Seventh Framework Program; European Research Council, ERC, (267583)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Program, as part of the CompMusic project (ERC grant agreement 267583).

It is a travelogue through the city of Havana, and looks in particular at the curatorial design of its museums. In this Cuban city where time is frozen in architecture, and peels off buildings, where all that is solid rots and melts in the air, memory is 'suited' to ruinous fabrics. In the Museum of the Revolution, torn shirts and worn-out skirts speak of the country's struggle. A model modernist apartment makes room for novel times. Similarly, the Museum of Decorative Arts displays objects of material culture to give space to a history that includes private life. In its (with) drawing room, historic conjunctions are tailored to the making of female space. In Havana, memory is not erected as monument but fashioned as material document. In a city of fantastic 20th-century architecture, and moving urban culture, history is written as interior design.

However, little is known about the dynamics of visual complexity perception of affective environmental scenes (IAPS pictures) and artworks, such as affective representational paintings. In three experiments, we studied the time course of visual complexity perception by varying presentation duration and comparing subjective ratings with objective measures of complexity. In Experiment 1, 60 females rated 96 IAPS pictures, presented either for 1, 5, or 25. s, for familiarity, complexity, pleasantness and arousal. In Experiment 2, another 60 females rated 96 representational paintings. Mean ratings of complexity and pleasantness changed according to presentation duration in a similar vein in both experiments, suggesting an inverted U-shape. No common pattern of results was observed for arousal and familiarity ratings across the two picture sets. The correlations between subjective and objective measures of complexity increased with longer exposure durations for IAPS pictures, but results were more ambiguous for paintings. Experiment 3 explored the time course of the multidimensionality of visual complexity perception. Another 109 females rated the number of objects, their disorganization and the differentiation between a figure-ground vs. complex scene composition of pictures presented for 1 and 5. s. The multidimensionality of visual complexity only clearly emerged in the 5-s condition. In both picture sets, the strength of the correlations with objective measures depended on the type of subdimension of complexity and was less affected by presentation duration than correlations with general complexity in Experiments 1 and 2. These results have clear implications for perceptual and cognitive theories, especially for those of esthetic experiences, in which the dynamical changes of complexity perception need to be integrated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complexity; Empirical esthetics; Exposure time; IAPS; Objective measures; Visual arts","Adult; Affect; Environment; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Paintings; Recognition (Psychology); Time Factors; Visual Perception; Young Adult; adult; affect; environment; esthetics; female; human; painting; physiology; psychology; recognition; time factor; vision; young adult","","","","","Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P23538-G21)","The authors would like to thank Katrin Mair, Lars-Michael Schöpper, and Denise Ramsperger for their assistance in data collection and Bruno Gingras for his proofreading and critical comments.

The goal of this study was to describe the design, development and evaluation of a programme of artistic education activities for these people based on visits to the Prado Museum. Methods: 12 people participated for two months in a program of artistic activities consisting of visits to the Prado. To determine the participants’ response to the programme, information was gathered through participant observation. Results: During the development of the program, the participant’s reactions of interest, engagement and satisfaction, as well as a positive effect on mood and social relations, were observed. Conclusion: The cognitive difficulties did not deter them from participating in the program, which had positive effects on the participants. It was concluded that the museum can be an important resource for the promotion of PWDs’ well-being and social inclusion. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arts therapy; dementias; participant observation; social psychology; Visual arts","","","","","","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (EDU2013-43253-R)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [grant number EDU2013-43253-R].","Abellan Garcia A., Ayala Garcia A., Pujol Rodriguez R., A profile of older people in Spain, 2017.

Inspired by Wicks and Freeman's new pragmatic approach to organization studies, we give an ethical question a central role in our analysis: to what extent is current research able to serve the needs of individual arts organizations and their communities? Our results highlight the influence of research traditions on the ethical implications of performance evaluation research.

It examines the influence of national, social and political contexts on art and health community projects by comparing practice and project outcomes. Method: Based on two case studies, the article draws on specific evidence in Britain and Denmark. The approach taken is one of the psychosocial inquiries allowing reflection on practice including participants' testimonies. Results: The two cases showed comparable problems with restricted resources, funding and organisational limitations to service delivery. The British case study shows a bottom-up approach in contrast to the Danish case study where the approach is top-down. Although the benefits from participation in art activities in the two countries were influenced by a complex set of different interacting factors, outcomes were typically similarly positive: finding identity, feeling a sense of well-being and increased self-confidence. Conclusion: In terms of practice, policy and research and in the recognition of value of art participation, the comparison demonstrates how different stories, contexts and institutions engage in different ways to facilitate and enable service users as well as generating different challenges; recognising the benefits of developing best practice guidelines in art practice in health settings. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Learning disabilities; Mental health; Social capital; Visual arts; Well-being","","","","","","","","Be creative, be well: Arts, wellbeing and local communities.

Ninety undergraduate music majors (52 females, 38 males) recruited from a major research university volunteered to participate. The data collection instrument consisted of two previously established inventories: the Performance Anxiety Inventory and the Music in Flow Inventory. As predicted, the data showed flow proneness to be significantly and negatively correlated with performance anxiety (r = -0.20, p = 0.034, one-tailed test). The data also supported a prediction that the ability to play/sing without destructive self-criticism would be negatively related to performance anxiety (r = -0.39, p < 0.001, one-tailed). The results suggest that both musical performance anxiety and a flow state of consciousness can exist simultaneously. It appears that creating performance conditions that foster flow may be a useful strategy for helping to alleviate the intensity of musical performance anxiety.","","anxiolytic agent; anxiety disorder; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; music; performance anxiety; performing arts","","","","","","","Bloom A.J., Skutnick-Henley P., Facilitating flow experiences among musicians, Am Mus Teacher, pp. 24-28, (2005); Dingfelder S.F., Putting the 'play' back into performing, Mon Psychol, 36, (2005); Csikszentmihaly M., Beyond Boredom and Anxiety, (1975); Khalsa S.B.S., Cope S., Effects of a yoga lifestyle intervention on performance-related characteristics of musicians: A preliminary study, Med Sci Mon, 12, pp. 325-331, (2006); Traverse J., Performance anxiety - mental impotence; MacDonald R., Byrne C., Carlton L., Creativity and flow in musical composition: An empirical investigation, Psychol Mus, 34, pp. 292-303, (2006); Salmon P.G., A psychological perspective on musical performance anxiety: A review of the literature, Med Probl Perform Art, 5, pp. 2-11, (1990); Fishbein M., Middlestadt S., Medical problems among ICSOM: Overview of a national survey, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 1-8, (1988); van Kemenade F.L.M., van Maarten S.M.J.M., van Heesch N.C.A., Performance anxiety among professional musicians in symphonic orchestras: A self-report study, Psychol Rep, 77, pp. 555-562, (1995); Ryan C., Exploring musical performance anxiety in children, Med Probl Perform Art, 13, pp. 83-88, (1998); Gratto S.D., The effectiveness of an audition anxiety workshop in reducing stress, Med Probl Perform Art, 13, pp. 29-34, (1998); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, (1994); Beck A., Emery G., Anxiety Disorder and Phobia, (1985); May R., The Meaning of Anxiety, (1977); Liebert R.M., Morris L.W., Cognitive and emotional components of test anxiety: A distinction and some initial data, Psychol Rep, 20, pp. 975-978, (1967); Wine J., Investigations of an Attentional Interpretation of Test Anxiety, (1971); Green B., Gallwey W.T., The Inner Game of Music, (1986); Zajonc R., Social facilitation, Science, 149, pp. 269-274, (1965); Merton T., The Collected Poems of Thomas Merton, (1977); Rabkin R., No more sweaty palms: You can tame performance anxiety, O'clock Club, Five, (1997); Kirchner J.M., Performance Anxiety in Solo Piano Playing, (2002); Brotons M., Effects of performing conditions on music performance anxiety and performance quality, J Mus Ther, 31, pp. 63-81, (1994); Kenny D.T., Davis P., Oates J., Music performance anxiety and occupational stress amongst opera chorus artists and their relationship with state and trait anxiety and perfectionism, J Anx Disord, 18, pp. 757-777, (2004); Kubzansky L.D., Stewart A.J., At the intersection of anxiety, gender, and performance, J Soc Clin Psychol, 18, pp. 76-97, (1999); LeBlanc A., Jin Y.C., Obert M., Silvola C., Effect of audience on music performance anxiety, J Res Mus Educ, 45, pp. 480-496, (1997); Mor S., Day H.I., Flett G.L., Hewitt P.L., Perfectionism, control, and components of performance anxiety in professional artists, Cogn Ther Res, 19, pp. 207-225, (1995); Nagel J.J., In pursuit of perfection: Career choice and performance anxiety in musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 140-145, (1988); Steptoe A., The relationship between tension and the quality of musical performance, J Int Soc Study Tension Perf, 1, pp. 12-22, (1983); Nagel J., Himle D., Papsdorf J., Coping with performance anxiety, NATS Bull, 26-27, 31, (1981); Nagel J., Himle D., Papsdorf J., Cognitive-behavioural treatment of musical performance anxiety, Psychol Mus, 17, pp. 12-21, (1989); Bodner E., Gilboa A., Amir D., The unexpected side-effects of dissonance, Psychol Mus, 35, pp. 286-305, (2007); Barrell J.J., Medeiros D., Barrell J.E., The causes and treatment of performance anxiety: An experiential approach, J Humanistic Psychol, 25, pp. 106-122, (1985); Gallwey W.T., The Inner Game of Tennis, (1997); Burns D., The Feeling Good Handbook, (1989); Bourne E., The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, (1990); Aicher C., Performance anxiety and practice techniques, Proceedings of the Pennsylvania Music Teachers Association Conference, (2007); Wolpe J., The Practice of Behavior Therapy, (1990)","J.

While the Western itself may seem simple (it isn't quite), an explanation of its popularity cannot be, for the Western, like any myth, stands between individual human consciousness and society. If a myth is popular, it must somehow appeal to or reinforce the individuals who view it by communicating a symbolic meaning to them. This meaning must, in turn, reflect the particular social institutions and attitudes that have created and continue to nourish the myth. Thus, a myth must tell its viewers about themselves and their society. This study, which takes up the question of the Western as an American myth, will lead us into abstract structural theory as well as economic and political history. Mostly, however, it will take us into the movies, the spectacular and not-so-spectacular sagebrush of the cinema. Unlike most works of social science, the data on which my analysis is based is available to all of my readers, either at the local theater or, more likely, on the late, late show. I hope you will take the opportunity, whenever it is offered, to check my findings and test my interpretations, the effort is small and the rewards are many. And if your wife, husband, mother, or child asks you why you are wasting your time staring at Westerns on TV in the middle of the night, tell them firmly—as I often did—that you are doing research in social science. © 1975, by The Regents of the University of California.","American experience; American myths; American violence; Cinema studies; Classical western; Contemporary american history; Cultural history; Cultural studies; Film literature; Film studies; Film studies textbook; General cinema; History of western films; Media studies; News media and culture industries; Performing arts; Political history; Religion myth; Social science; Sociology anthropology; Structural theory; Why are westerns so popular; Wild west","","","","","","","","Barnet R.J., Roots of War, (1972); Bazin A., What is Cinema?, (1971); Burke K., A Rhetoric of Motives, (1969); Cawelti J.G., The Six-Gun Mystique, Bowling Green Popular Press, (1971); Commoner B., The Closing Circle, Alfred A, (1971); Danto A.C., Analytical Philosophy of History, (1968); Drucker P.F., Technology, Management, and Society, (1970); Emery P.E., Psychological Effects of the Western Film: A Study in Television Viewing, Human Relations, 12, 3, (1959); Galbraith J.K., The New Industrial State, (1968); Georges R.A., Studies on Mythology, The Dorsey Press, (1968); Habermas J., Toward a Rational Society, (1970); Jakobson R., Fundamentals of Language, (1956); Kitses J., Horizons West.

The central cross-curricular orientation draws significantly on a range of other theoretical perspectives, both general and specific to language learning pedagogy. The application of this approach in practice is illustrated in sample material drawn from a new resource entitled ‘Language into Art and the Work of Ali Omar Ermes’ aimed at Intermediate and Advanced students of Arabic. Activities in the resource reflect the dual focus on content and language and are based around three stages of Approaching-Exploring-Creating. This leads on to presentation of a small-scale qualitative research study based on teaching of a unit from the resource at a London school employing an action research methodology. Substantial evidence emerges from analysis of the data collected indicating high levels of student engagement and Arabic language-and-culture learning. Other outcomes include a deeper appreciation of the interfaces between linguistic and artistic expression in the context of Middle Eastern art and the stimulus provided for student voice. The study is distinctive in its conceptualisation, in the detailed pedagogical model it provides and in the attention given to analysis of its impact in a classroom situation.

Mathematics describes the acoustics of the sounds giving formal tools to physics, and the matter of music itself in terms of compositional structures and strategies. Mathematics can also be applied to the entire making of music, from the score to the performance, connecting compositional structures to the acoustical reality of sounds. Moreover, the precise concept of gesture has a decisive role in understanding musical performance. In this article, we apply some concepts of category theory to compare gestures of orchestral musicians, and to investigate the relationship between orchestra and conductor, as well as between listeners and conductor/orchestra. To this aim, we will introduce the concept of gestural similarity. The mathematical tools used can be applied to gesture classification, and to interdisciplinary comparisons between music and the visual arts. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","category theory;

The purpose of this research study was to describe the presence of physical symptoms in college-age musicians and the impact of these symptoms on music-playing and other daily occupations. Data collection was completed on college instrumental music majors using two survey questionnaires, which documented the presence of physical symptoms in the upper limb and the impact of these symptoms on function. The results indicate that a significant number of students reported pain or discomfort that occurred during music-playing, at rest, and during other daily occupations. Results were consistent with the literature in regards to the prevalence of symptoms in female instrumentalists as compared to males and the occurrence of more symptoms in those individuals playing string instruments and piano as compared to other instrument groups. Also, as self-reported pain increased, a greater level of dysfunction in occupational performance was found. Results also indicated that when participants were already implementing intervention strategies, this was perhaps a predictor of the presence of pain and dysfunction. Health professionals should be encouraged to provide preventive education for student musicians and to use outcome measures, such as the Disabilities of the Hand, Arm, and Shoulder (DASH) outcome measure, to identify the potential for functional impairments.","","accident prevention; adolescent; adult; article; controlled study; female; health survey; human; instrument; major clinical study; male; musician; occupational disease; occupational hazard; pain assessment; performing arts; prevalence; questionnaire; symptomatology","","","","","","","Ackermann B., Adams R., Marshall E., Strength or endurance training for undergraduate music majors at a university?, Med Probl Perform Art, 17, pp. 33-41, (2002); Fishbein M., Middlestadt S.E., Ottati V., Straus S., Medical problems among ICSOM musicians: Overview of a national survey, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 1-8, (1988); Shoup D., Survey of performance-related problems among high school and junior high school musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 10, 3, pp. 100-105, (1995); Britsch L., Investigating performance related problems of young musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 20, pp. 40-47, (2005); Manchester R.A., The incidence of hand problems in music students, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 15-18, (1988); Hagglund K.L., Jacobs K., Physical and mental practices of music students as they relate to the occurrence of music-related injuries, Work, 6, pp. 11-24, (1996); Polisi J., The subtle art: Educating the musician of the twenty-first century, Med Probl Perform Art, 1, pp. 113-116, (1986); Cayea D., Manchester R.A., Instrument-specific rates of upper extremity injuries in music students, Med Probl Perform Art, 13, pp. 19-25, (1988); Knishkowy B., Lederman R.J., Instrumental musicians with upper extremity disorders, Med Probl Perform Art, 1, pp. 85-89, (1986); Dawson W.J., Hand and upper extremity problems in musicians: Epidemiology and diagnosis, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 19-22, (1988); Quarrier N.F., Performing arts medicine: The musical athlete, J Sports Phys Ther, 17, pp. 90-95, (1993); Miller C., Moa G., Injury characteristics and outcomes at a performing arts school clinic, Med Probl Perform Art, 13, pp. 120-124, (1998); Newmark J., Lederman R.J., Practice doesn't necessarily make perfect: Incidence of overuse syndromes in amateur instrumentalists, Med Probl Perform Art, 2, 4, pp. 142-144, (1987); Lederman R.J., Calabrese D.O., Overuse syndromes in instrumentalists, Med Probl Perform Art, 1, pp. 7-11, (1986); Zaza C., Playing-related health problems at a Canadian music school, Med Probl Perform Art, 7, pp. 48-51, (1992); Lockwood A., Medical problems in secondary school-aged musicians, Med Probl Perform Art, 3, pp. 129-132, (1988); Hoppmann R.A., Patrone N.A., Musculoskeletal problems in instrumental musicians, Textbook of Performing Arts Medicine, pp. 71-95, (1991); Warrington J., Hand therapy for the musician: Instrument focused rehabilitation, Hand Clin, 19, pp. 287-301, (2003); Norris R.N., Return to play after injury: Strategies to support a musician's recovery, Work, 7, pp. 89-93, (1996); Hoppmann R.A., Instrumental musicians' hazards, Occup Med State Art Rev, 16, pp. 619-631, (2003); Blackie H., Stone R., Tiernan A., An investigation of injury prevention among university piano students, Med Probl Perform Art, 14, pp. 141-149, (1999); Norris R., The Musician's Survival Manual: A Guide to Preventing and Treating Injuries in Instrumentalists, International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM) and MMB Music, 1993. 〈AU: Pls give city of publication〉; Solway S., Beaton D.E., McConnell S., Bombardier C., The DASH Outcome Measure User's Manual, (2002); Beaton D., Bombardier C., Katz J., Et al., Measuring the whole or parts?: Validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand ourcome measure in different regions of the upper extremity, J Hand Ther, 14, pp. 128-140, (2001); Hunsaker F.G., Cioffi D.A., Amadio P.C., Et al., The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons outcomes instruments: Normative values from the general population, J Bone Joint Surg (Am), 84 A, 2, pp. 208-215, (2002); Guptill C., Zaza C., Paul S., An occupational study of physical playing-related injuries in college music students, Med Probl Perform Art, 15, pp. 86-90, (2000); Occupational therapy practice framework: Domain and process, Am J Occup Ther, 56, pp. 609-639, (2002); Parry C.G., Prevention of musicians' hand problems, Hand Clin, 19, pp. 317-324, (2003)","R.

Musculoskeletal disorders related to playing are painful, chronic and disabling conditions which are prevalent among classical musicians. The widespread study of the prevalence, etiology, and management of playing- related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) is a recent development known as performing arts medicine. Despite the rapid development of this new field, it is unclear how musicians identify themselves as injured, and how they make decisions about what, if anything, to do about these disabling injuries. The aims of our study were twofold. First, we aimed to provide musicians with the opportunity to define a PRMD in their own words. Second, we sought to understand the subjective meaning of the PRMD experience to musicians. Two key informants identified 30 study participants in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. As a form of data triangulation, participants included 27 musicians and three health professionals. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews which lasted, on average, 40 min. Data were transcribed, and were manually coded and analyzed. Participants defined a PRMD as pain and other symptoms which are chronic, are beyond their control, and which interfere with their ability to play their instrument at their usual level. Participants distinguished between 'normal', mild everyday aches and pains, and a PRMD. Although a PRMD is not a medically serious or life-threatening illness, it is devastating to musicians physically, emotionally, socially, and financially. The overall theme of suffering captures the meaning of these problems which threaten the identity of the musician. The findings of this study are consistent with other studies of the experience of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and other illnesses.","Medicine; Musculoskeletal disorders; Musicians; Performing arts","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Music; Occupational Diseases; Ontario; Quebec; adult; art; article; chronic disease; clinical article; experience; female; human; identity; interview; male; musculoskeletal disease; musician; pain; symptomatology","","","","","Department of Health Studies and Gerontology; University of Waterloo; Medical Research Council Canada, MRC","This research was conducted while Dr Zaza was supported by a Medical Research Council of Canada (MRC) Studentship, at the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, University of Waterloo, and the manuscript was prepared while she was a MRC Post-Doctoral Fellow at McMaster University.

This time the investigated case is a small touring theater in Sweden. At the time of the study, the Swedish Performing Arts association had started a project aimed at the standardization of accounting procedures and vocabulary within the Swedish performing arts sector (268). This project was funded by the Swedish Arts Council, and the administrative director of the investigated theater was a member of the project team (268–269). At the same time, the theater had to adopt a scorecard developed by the local municipality (which owned the theater together with the county council) both for internal management control and for reporting to its owners (264, 276). In his case study, Sundström explores the implications of distance between providers and users of accounting information. With distance he does not only mean physical distance, but also differences in knowledge and understanding of the contexts represented by accounting information (260–261). The small, publicly funded touring theater investigated by Sundström faces this issue, since it is held accountable by different stakeholders, internal and external, based on numerical representations of its artistic activities and of the results achieved. Decontextual-ized interpretations of numbers become even more problematic in a setting where numbers are considered inadequate to represent performance, as is the case for performing arts organizations (261–262).","Adam B., Mussari R., Jones R., The Diversity of accrual policies in local government financial reporting: An examination of infrastructure, art and heritage assets in Germany, Italy and the UK, Financial Accountability & Management, 27, 2, pp. 107-133, (2011); Armstrong P., Anne T., Art and accountability: The language of design and managerial control, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 9, 5, pp. 114-125, (1996); Arnaboldi M., Azzone G., Constructing performance measurement in the public sector, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 21, 4, pp. 266-282, (2010); Atkinson A.A., Kaplan R.S., Matsumura E.M., Young S.M., Management Accounting: Information for Decision-Making and Strategy Execution, (2012); Badia F., Fabio D., Performance measurement at world heritage sites: Per Aspera ad Astra, International Journal of Arts Management, 16, 1, pp. 20-34, (2013); Barton A.D., Accounting for public heritage facilities-assets or liabilities of the government?, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 13, 2, pp. 219-235, (2000); Barton A.D., The conceptual arguments concerning accounting for public heritage assets: A note, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 18, 3, pp. 434-440, (2005); Boorsma M.A., Chiaravalloti F., Arts marketing performance: An artistic-mission-led approach to evaluation, Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 40, 4, pp. 297-317, (2010); Bourguignon A., Malleret V., Hanne N., The American balanced scorecard versus the French Tableau de Bord: The ideological dimension, Management Accounting Research, 15, 2, pp. 107-134, (2004); Bourguignon A., Eve C., The role of criticism in the dynamics of performance evaluation systems, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 16, 6, pp. 665-700, (2005); Broadbent J., Dietrich M., Richard L., The development of principal-agent, contracting and accountability relationships in the public sector: Conceptual and cultural problems, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 7, 3, pp. 259-284, (1996); Broadbent J., Richard L., Resisting the 'new public management': Absorption and absorbing groups in schools and gp practices in the UK, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 11, 4, pp. 403-435, (1998); Carnegie G.D., Wolnizer P.W., The financial value of cultural, heritage and scientific collections: An accounting fiction, Australian Accounting Review, 5, 1, pp. 31-47, (1995); Carnegie G.D., Wolnizer P.W., Enabling accountability in museums, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 9, 5, pp. 84-99, (1996); Carnegie G.D., Wolnizer P.W., The financial reporting of publicly-owned collections: Whither financial (market) values and contingent valuation estimates?, Australian Accounting Review, 7, 1, pp. 44-50, (1997); Carnegie G.D., Wolnizer P.W., Unraveling the rhetoric about the financial reporting of public collections as assets, Australian Accounting Review, 9, 1, pp. 16-21, (1999); Chang L.-C., The impact of political interests upon the formulation of performance measurements: The NHS Star Rating System, Financial Accountability & Management, 25, 2, pp. 145-165, (2009); Chiaravalloti F., Piber M., Ethical implications of methodological settings in arts management research: The case of performance evaluation, The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 41, 4, pp. 240-266, (2011); Christiansen J.K., Peter S., Implementing budgetary control in the performing arts: Games in the organizational theatre, Management Accounting Research, 8, 4, pp. 405-438, (1997); Christensen A.L., Mohr R.M., Testing a positive theory model ofmuseum accounting practices, Financial Accountability & Management, 11, 4, pp. 317-335, (1995); Cooper H.M., Literature-searching strategies of integrative research reviewers: A first survey, Science Communication, 8, 2, pp. 372-383, (1986); Eikhof D.R., Axel H., For art's sake!

W. Griffith played a key role in the reformulating of film's narrative techniques, thus contributing to the creation of what we now think of as the classical Hollywood cinema. This book is the only extensive treatment of a critical period in the history of film acting: the emergence of the realistic ""verisimilar"" style in Griffith's biograph films. Roberta Pearson shows how Griffith gradually abandoned the deliberately affected ""histrionic"" acting style derived from the nineteenth-century stage. No longer did actors mime distress by raising their arms to heaven or clutching their heads—a subtle facial expression, a slight change in posture would convey a character's extreme emotions instead. Pearson makes detailed comparisons of certain Biograph films and brings a freshness to her analysis by closely examining contemporary journalistic writing, acting manuals, and the recollections of actors of the time. Her work is important for anyone interested in early cinema and performance, and it will enliven the study of American cultural history and mass communications. © 1992 by The Regents of the University of California.","acting manuals; actors; american cultural history; american director; biography films; birth of a nation; cinema; classical hollywood cinema; controversy; dw griffith; early cinema; extreme emotion; feature length movie; film acting; film and television; film theory; henry d walthall; hollywood; mass communication; movie theory; movies; narrative technique; performance style; performing arts; realistic film; theatrical heritage; trade press discourse; united states of america; verisimilar","","","","","","","","Affron C., Star Acting, (1977); Agnew F., Moving Picture Acting, (1911); Allen R.C., Looking at 'Another Look at the Chaser Theory,, Studies in Visual Communication, 10, 4, (1984); Allen R.C., Vaudeville and Film, 1895-1915: A Study in Media Interaction, (1980); Arvidson L., When the Movies were Young, (1969); Auerbach E., Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, (1974); Baker C., David W.

Method: Twenty South Australian actors were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Ten were male and 10 female, ranging in age from 22 to 66 years old, with self-reported professional experience ranging from 1 to 50 years. The participants were interviewed in-depth about their experiences of being an actor, with a particular focus on wellbeing, and the data were analysed using thematic analysis, with numerous checks in place for methodological rigour. Results: Two broad categories of themes were established; environmental and personal factors. Environmental factors included power, lifestyle, fringe-dwelling, engagement, the tribe, and taking care of yourself. Personal factors included pursuit, strengths, the calling, precariousness and looking within. Conclusions: Themes were considered in terms of contemporary wellbeing theory, along with clinical implications relating to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM5). Findings included: actors experience a range of threats to wellbeing, such as problems with autonomy, lack of environmental mastery, complex interpersonal relationships and high self-criticism. Factors facilitating wellbeing include ongoing personal growth and a sense of purpose. The findings also suggest that actors are vulnerable to depression, generalised anxiety symptoms, vicarious trauma, and perfectionism. © 2016 The Australian Psychological Society","actors; mental health; performing arts; qualitative; wellbeing","","","","","","","","Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, (2013); Antaki C., Billig M., Edwards D., Potter J., Discourse analysis means doing analysis: A critique of six analytic shortcomings, DAOL Discourse Analysis Online, 1, 1, pp. 1-12, (2002); Snapshot of MPA company key trends from 2012 data, (2013); Arts and culture in Australia A statistical overview, (2007); Generalised Anxiety Disorder, (2015); Bhullar N., Hine D.W., Phillips W.J., Profiles of psychological well-being in a sample of Australian university students, International Journal of Psychology, 49, 4, pp. 288-294, (2014); Bozkurt M., Evren C., Can Y., Evren B., Cetingok S., Yilmaz A., Relationships of personality dimensions with impulsivity in alcohol-dependent inpatient men, Nordic Journal of Psychiatry, 68, pp. 316-322, (2014); Brandfonbrener A.G., The forgotten patients, Medical Problems of Performing Artists, 7, 4, pp. 101-102, (1992); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101, (2006); Buetow S., Thematic analysis and its reconceptualization as ‘saliency analysis’, Journal of Health Services Research & Policy, 15, 2, pp. 123-125, (2010); Burgoyne S., Poulin K., Reasden A., The impact of acting on student actors: Boundary blurring, growth, and emotional distress, Theatre Topics, 9, pp. 157-179, (1999); Byrne S., McLean N., Eating disorders in athletes: A review of the literature, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 4, pp. 145-159, (2001); Duck S., (2014); Egan S.J., Wade T.D., Shafran R., The transdiagnostic process of perfectionism, Revista de Psicopatología y Psicología Clínica, 17, 3, pp. 279-294, (2012); Filmer A., Minding the gap: The performer in the wings, New Theatre Quarterly, 24, pp. 158-169, (2008); Fossey E., Harvey C., McDermott F., Davidson L., Understanding and evaluating qualitative research, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 36, pp. 717-732, (2012); Gilbert P., The evolution of social attractiveness and its role in shame, humilitation, guilt and therapy, British Journal of Medical Psychology, 70, pp. 113-147, (1997); Griffin J., (2010); Guptill C.A., The lived experience of professional musicians with playing-related injuries: a phenomenological inquiry, Medical Problems of Performing Artists, 26, 2, pp. 84-95, (2011); Haslam A., McGarty C., Research methods and statistics in psychology, (2014); Hays K.F., Brown C.H., You're on!

Notions of record and archive are critically investigated, raising questions about applying traditional archival definitions to the performing arts. Defining the nature of performances is at the root of all difficulties regarding their representation. Performances are live events, so for many people the idea of recording them for posterity is inappropriate. The challenge of creating and curating representations of an ephemeral art form are explored and performance-specific concepts of record and archive are posited. An open model of archives, encouraging multiple representations and allowing for creative reuse and reinterpretation to keep the spirit of the performance alive, is envisaged as the future of the performing arts archive. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Fixity; Liveness; Performing arts; Record; Representation; The archive","","","","","","","","Auslander P., Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture, (1999); Auslander P., The performativity of performance documentation, PAJ: J Perform Art, 84, pp. 1-10, (2006); Barba E., Efermaele: That which will be said afterwards, Drama Rev, 36, 2, pp. 77-80, (1992); Harris V., Telling the stories of a continuing walk to freedom: Nelson Mandela and the archive, Paper Given at the Conference on the Cultural Value of Oral History, (2007); Levy D., Scrolling Forward: Making Sense of Documents in the Digital Age, (2001); Lycouris S., The documentation of practice: Framing trace, Working Papers in Art and Design, 1, (2002); Phelan P., Unmarked: The Politics of Performance, (1993); Popat S., Palmer S., Creating common ground: Dialogues between performance and digital technologies, Int J Perform Arts Digit Media, 1, 1, pp. 47-65, (2005); Reason M., Archive or memory?

This paper assesses the impact of creative workshops participation on the psychological well-being, social connectivity and subjective experience of people diagnosed with SMI. Method: After participating in a creative workshop in a museum, 19 people, including service users, keyworkers, the art facilitator and a psychologist were interviewed. Four observers participated in the workshop and provided information about the creative process by means of a discussion group. Data were analysed in accordance with thematic analysis methodology and triangulated in order to obtain reliability. Results: Five essential categories were identified: learning process, social connection, psychological well-being, institutional change and mutual recovery. Conclusions: Creative activities may cause a transformation of the image of dysfunction associated with mental illness as well as promoting health and recovery. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Mental health; museum; recovery; schizophrenia; visual arts","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/G065802/1, EP/M02315X/1, EP/N02785X/1); Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/K003364/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/M00161X/1)","This project was an additional enquiry to a larger study funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, UK, entitled “Creative practice as mutual recovery: Connecting communities for mental health and well-being” [grant number AH/K003364/1].","Arber S., Venn S., Caregiving at night: Understanding the impact on carers, Journal of Aging Studies, 25, pp. 155-165, (2011); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101, (2006); Bungay H., Munn-Giddings C., Boyce M., Wilson C., The value of the arts in therapeutic and clinical interventions: A critical review of the literature, (2014); Cohen D.J., Crabtree B.F., Evaluative criteria for qualitative research in health care: Controversies and recommendations, The Annals of Family Medicine, 6, pp. 331-339, (2008); Cornes M., Manthorpe J., Joly L., O'Halloran S., Reconciling recovery, personalisation and Housing First: Integrating practice and outcome in the field of multiple exclusion homelessness, Health & Social Care in the Community, 22, pp. 134-143, (2014); Corrigan P.W., Kerr A., Knudsen L., The stigma of mental illness: Explanatory models and methods for change, Applied and Preventive Psychology, 11, pp. 179-190, (2005); Crawford P., Brown B., Baker C., Tischler V., Abrams B., Health humanities, (2015); Dodd J., Jones C., Mind, body, spirit: How museums impact health and wellbeing, (2014); Hacking S., Secker J., Spandler H., Kent L., Shenton J., Evaluating the impact of participatory art projects for people with mental health needs, Health & Social Care in the Community, 16, pp. 638-648, (2008); Hurley J., Linsley P., Rowe S., Fontanella F., Empathy at a distance: A qualitative study on the impact of publically-displayed art on observers, International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 23, pp. 419-426, (2014); Keshavan M.S., Vinogradov S., Rumsey J., Sherrill J., Wagner A., Cognitive training in mental disorders: Update and future directions, American Journal of Psychiatry, 171, pp. 510-522, (2014); Lackoi K., Patsou M., Chatterjee H.J., Bartholomew J., Medical T., Brown A., Phillips L., Museums for health and wellbeing.

Drawing from the literature on market orientation and organizational culture theory, the author develops a framework of market orientation with its antecedents and uses it to analyze data from interviews with administrative or artistic directors of performing arts organizations. The manifestation of market orientation seemed to vary from clear to somewhat clear to unclear according to three identified program planning approaches: creativity-based, resource-based and mission-based. Both a reactive and a proactive market orientation were identified. Market orientation behaviour, focusing on customers, competitors and stakeholders, appeared under specific cultural and sociostructural antecedents and seemed to relate mainly to customer beliefs and information generated from repetitive experience.","Arts marketing;

Because Boltanski is obsessively concerned with the death-like rupture and loss by which experience is continuously reduced to fragmentary and inaccurate memories of the past, especially regarding the adult's perception of childhood, archives represent for him a potential means of regaining access to what has been lost and is being mourned. However, Boltanski's installation and performance works that investigate the powers of archives set out ironically the absurdly limited and misleading processes of an archive. Photography in particular is shown to be unreliable, more icon than document, challenging rather than asserting notions of category and coherence. The notion of the icon, moreover, underlines the spiritual dimension that accompanies this absurdist relationship with the past. Our faulty but much-desired awareness of a past gives complex value to our present, often in a touching, pathetic way, however arbitrary the means involved. The trail of the archive leads to an uncertainty that is nonetheless precious. The many subjects that Boltanski treats in this light vary disarmingly and controversially from the trivia and detritus of everyday living to the supreme seriousness of the Holocaust. He also transforms himself and his family into a labyrinthine and playful archive. Here a curious relationship emerges with the reputation and books of his brother, the sociologist Luc Boltanski. Christian borrows with no explicit acknowledgement the archive resources of Luc's sociological research as a sub-text in his visual works. Even more surprisingly, Luc Boltanski published in 1993 Poème, a collection of highly emotive and personal poetry about the past and the Holocaust.

Proposals for iconic languages are not new but the computer offers the ability to incorporate interactivity and animation into iconic writing and reading systems. One approach to developing computer-based iconic communication systems derives from the visual arts (i.e. graphic design, illustration, film animation, documentary video, etc.). An alternative approach is derived from computational linguistics in that the syntactic or semantic structure of language is retained while iconic images are used in place of words. Differences between the study of natural language and the design of an iconic language are discussed and the components of one particular system, IconText, are described. Of particular interest is the attempt to capture some pragmatic aspects of communication, both in terms of conveying the intentions of the author and concerning the sequential delivery of the message. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","conceptual dependency; discourse; iconic languages; icons","Animation; Computational linguistics; Data communication systems; Image communication systems; Image processing; Interactive computer graphics; Natural language processing systems; Conceptual dependency; Discourse structures; Iconic communication; Iconic languages; Internet; Multimedia; Semantics; Syntactics; Visual arts; WIMP interface; Graphical user interfaces","","","","","","","Baecker R., Small I., Animation at the Interface, The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design, pp. 251-267, (1990); Barker P., Manji K., Pictorial Dialogue Methods, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 31, 3, pp. 323-348, (1989); Barrow H.G., Baker B.R., Minspeak, a Semantic Compaction System that Makes Self-Expression Easier for Communicatively Disabled Individuals, Byte, 7, 9, pp. 186-202, (1982); Beardon C., CD-Icon: An Iconic Language Based on Conceptual Dependency, Intelligent Tutoring Media, 3, 4, pp. 111-116, (1992); Beardon C., Computer-Based Iconic Communication, AI and Cognitive Science '92, pp. 263-276, (1993); Bliss C.K., Semantography (Blissymbolics), (1965); Dormann C., Self-Explaining Icons, Intelligent Tutoring Media, 5, 2, pp. 81-85, (1994); Edmondson W., Abstraction and Organisation in Signs and Sign Systems, Intelligent Tutoring Media, 5, 2, pp. 63-72, (1994); Gaver W.W., The Sonic Finder: an Interface that uses Auditory Icons, Human-Computer Interaction, 4, pp. 67-94, (1989); Gittens D., Icon-Based Human-Computer Interaction, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 24, pp. 519-543, (1986); Grosz B.J., Sidner C.L., Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse, Computational Linguistics, 12, 3, pp. 175-204, (1986); Kay A., User Interface: A Personal View, The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design, pp. 191-207, (1990); Marcus A., Visual Rhetoric in Pictographic-Ideographic, Proceedings of The Second Congress of the International Association for Semiotic Studies, pp. 1501-1508, (1979); Mealing S., Yazdani M., A Computer-Based Iconic Language, Intelligent Tutoring Media, 1, 3, pp. 133-136, (1992); Mealing S., Talking Pictures, Intelligent Tutoring Media, 2, 2, pp. 63-69, (1992); Neurath O., International Picture Language, (1978); Schank R.C., Identification of Conceptualisations Underlying Natural Language, Computer Models of Thought and Language, pp. 187-247, (1973); Tonfoni G., Writing as a Visual Art, (1994); Wittgenstein L., Philosophical Investigations, (1953); Wittgenstein L., Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, (1961); Woods W., Semantics and Quantification in Natural Language Question Answering, Advances in Computers17, pp. 2-64, (1978)","C.

Because of its ability to communicate research findings in an emotive and embodied manner, theatre holds particular potential for health research, which often engages complex questions of the human condition. In order to evaluate the research potential of theatre, this article critically examines examples of evaluated health research studies that have used theatre for the purposes of data analysis or translation. We examine these studies from two perspectives. First, the literature is divided and categorized into four theatre genres: (1) non-theatrical performances; (2) ethnodramas, which can be interactive or non-interactive; (3) theatrical research-based performances; and (4) fictional theatrical performances. This categorization highlights the importance of these genres of theatre and provides an analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of each, thus providing insight into how theatre may be most effectively utilized in health research. Second, we explore the efficacy of using theatre for the purposes of data analysis and knowledge transfer, and critically examine potential approaches to the evaluation of such endeavours. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: This study explored the specific part played by the creative aspects of introductory arts courses that aim to improve mental well-being. Nine course participants consented to recording of accreditation assessment meetings held with them towards the end of their course. Results: Thematic analysis identified themes relating to two categories: creative processes and the learning that ensued. The creative processes were playful experimentation and inspiration. Learning processes revolved around learning to learn and artistic development. Conclusions: Previous studies have found play, inspiration and learning to be associated with well-being. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the creative aspects of the courses did play an important part in improving participants’ well-being. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","interviewing; mental health; thematic analysis; Visual arts","accreditation; clinical article; female; human; learning; male; psychological well-being; thematic analysis","","","","","","","Apter M.J., Kerr J.H., The nature, function and value of play, Adult play: A reversal theory approach, pp. 163-176, (1991); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101, (2006); Brown S., Play: How it shapes the brain, opens the imagination, and invigorates the soul, (2009); Buheji M., Saif Z., Jahrami H., Why inspiration matters, Journal of Inspiration Economy, 1, pp. 15-24, (2014); Crossick G., Kaszynska P., Understanding the value of arts and culture: The AHRC cultural value project, (2016); Fontana D., Shape, colour, and symbols, Adult play: A reversal theory approach, pp. 141-149, (1991); Gray P., The value of play I: The definition of play provides clues to its purpose, Psychology Today, (2008); Hill C.E., Thompson B.J., Nutt Williams E., A guide to conducting consensual qualitative research, The Counseling Psychologist, 25, pp. 517-572, (1997); Huppert F., Whittington J., Positive mental health in individuals and populations, The science of well-being, pp. 304-307, (2004); Kiaei Y.A., Reio T.G., Goal pursuit and eudaimonic well-being among university students: Metacognition as the mediator, Behavioral Development Bulletin, 19, pp. 91-104, (2014); Margrove K., Heydinrych K., Secker J., Waiting list controlled evaluation of a participatory arts course for people experiencing mental health problems, Perspectives in Public Health, 133, pp. 28-35, (2013); Lifelong learning and well-being: An analysis of the relationship between adult learning and subjective well-being, (2009); Learn for mental wellbeing, (2015); Parkes J., Volpe V., Colour for well-being: Exploring adult learners’ responses to utilizing colour as a therapeutic tool, Journal of Applied Arts and Health, 3, pp. 275-293, (2013); Ryan R., Deci E., On happiness and human potentials: A review of research on hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 141-166, (2001); Secker J., Current conceptualisations of mental health and mental health promotion, Health Education Research Theory and Practice, 13, pp. 57-66, (1998); Secker J., Hacking S., Spandler H., Kent M., Shenton J., Mental health, social inclusion and arts: Developing the evidence base, (2007); Secker J., Loughran M., Heydinrych K., Kent L., Promoting mental well-being and social inclusion through art: Evaluation of an arts and mental health project, Arts and Health, 3, pp. 51-60, (2011); Spandler H., Secker J., Kent L., Hacking S., Shenton J., Catching life: The contribution of arts initiatives to recovery approaches in mental health, Journal of Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing, 14, pp. 791-799, (2007); Tennant R., Hiller L., Fishwick R., Platt S., Joseph S., Weich S., Stewart-Brown S., The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): Development and UK validation, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, 5, (2007); Thrash T., Elliot A., Maruskin L., Cassidy S., Inspiration and the promotion of well-being: Tests of causality and mediation, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 98, pp. 488-506, (2010); Thrash T., Moldovan E., Fuller A., Dombrowski J., Inspiration and the creative process, Creativity and mental illness, pp. 343-362, (2014); Thomson L., Chatterjee H., Assessing well-being outcomes for arts and heritage activities: Development of a Museum Well-being Measures toolkit, Journal of Applied Arts and Health, 5, pp. 29-50, (2014); Turner-Crowson J., Wallcraft J., The recovery vision for mental health services and research: A British perspective, Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal, 25, pp. 245-254, (2002); Wilson C., Secker J., Kent L., Keay J., Promoting mental well-being and social inclusion through art: Six month follow up results from Open Arts Essex, International Journal of Mental Health Promotion; Mental health: Strengthening mental health promotion, (2007)","J.

This paper is informed by research on perfectionism in social, clinical and sport psychology. It presents evidence to suggest that perfectionism may have paradoxical effects on those seeking to excel in sport, and warns that the same debilitating processes may be observed in other performance contexts. After first outlining the nature of perfectionism, the paper attempts to differentiate perfectionism from adaptive achievement striving, and explain the process by which perfectionism may undermine the quality of motivation and contribute to burnout in aspiring athletes. It then presents evidence to demonstrate that this characteristic may have similarly debilitating consequences in the performing arts. Finally, the paper offers some practical strategies for those working with performing artists exhibiting perfectionistic tendencies. These strategies focus upon modification of psychological mechanisms which underpin debilitating patterns of cognition, affect and behaviour, and they suggest how perfectionism and its destructive effects might be successfully managed in performance contexts while enabling individuals to sustain high quality motivation in their pursuit of excellence. © 2012 Taylor and Francis.","burnout;

The field requires versatility in a combination of skills including dancing, singing, and drama in a high frequency of performances. The aim of this study was to analyze and evaluate the health situation of musical theater students using a complete musical educational institute as an example (n = 37). METHODS: The basis for the evaluation was a questionnaire survey (standardized F 1000). All students of the school participated (20 males, 17 females). RESULTS: Of the students, 62% have a part-time job for financial reasons, and 67.7% state only a ""partial satisfaction"" with their body. Regarding injury, 45.9% claim to sustain an orthopaedic injury up to twice a year, and 29.7% up to three or four times. A total of 49 acute injuries (1.3/student) and 42 chronic complaints (1.1/student) were stated. The lower extremity was the most common acutely injured region (65.3%), followed by the spine (16.3%) and upper extremity (14.3%). Of chronic complaints, the lumbar spine was the most commonly affected area, followed by the hip joint and pelvic area. Thirty-three and 24% of acute injuries occurred during ""spins"" and/or ""stretching,"" respectively. There were various causes for physical and mental problems. DISCUSSION: The results show both parallels and differences to the relevant literature. It is shown that health hazards already arise in the education of musical performers. This provides particulars for the implementation of injury prevention measures during the theoretical and practical education of musical students. © 2012 Science & Medicine.","","Dancing; Drama; Female; Health Status; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Injuries; Pilot Projects; Risk Factors; Students; Young Adult; accident prevention; acute disease; adult; career; chronic disease; coping behavior; dietary intake; female; health hazard; health status; hip; human; human experiment; income; injury; lumbar spine; male; movement (physiology); music; musical theater performer; pain; pelvis; performing artist; performing arts; physical activity; pilot study; questionnaire; review; sex difference; social environment; social status; stress management; student; student satisfaction; substance use; young adult; article; dancing; job satisfaction; literature; occupational accident; occupational exposure; risk factor; statistics","","","","","","","Bronner S., Ojofeitimi S., Mayers L., Comprehensive surveillance of dance injuries: A proposal for uniform reporting guidelines for professional companies, J Dance Med Sci, 10, 3-4, pp. 69-80, (2006); Wanke E.M., Mill H., Arbeitsmittel Körper - Zum Auftreten von Arbeitsunfällen im professionellen Bühnentanz, Sicherheitsbeauftragter, 3, pp. 14-15, (2006); Echegoyen E., Acuna E., Rodriguez C., Injuries in students of three different dance techniques, Med Probl Perform Art, 25, 2, pp. 72-74, (2010); Arendt Y.D., Kerschbaumer F., Verletzungen und Überlastungserscheinungen im professionellen Ballett, Z Orthop, 141, pp. 349-356, (2003); Evans R.W., Evans R.I., Carvajal S., Survey of injuries among West End performers, Occup Environ Med, 55, 9, pp. 585-593, (1998); Wanke E.M., Groneberg D.A., Quarcoo D., Analysis and evaluation of acute injuries in musical performers, Sportverletz Sportschaden, 25, 3, pp. 179-183, (2011); Evans R.W., Evans R.I., Carvajal S., Perry S., A survey of injuries among Broadway performers, Am J Public Health, 86, 1, pp. 77-80, (1996); Evans R.W., Evans R.I., Varvaja S., A survey of injuries among Broadway performers: Types of injuries, treatments and perceptions of performers, Med Probl Perform Art, 11, pp. 15-19, (1996); Wanke E.M., Mill H., Groneberg D.A., Ballet as high-performance activity: Health risks exemplified by acute injuries in dance students, Sportverletz Sportschaden, 26, 3, pp. 164-170, (2012); Leanderson C., Leanderson J., Wykman A., Et al., Musculoskeletal injuries in young ballet dancers, Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc, 19, 9, pp. 1531-1535, (2011); Baker J., Scott D., Watkins K., Et al., Self-reported and reported injury patterns in contemporary dance students, Med Probl Perform Art, 25, 1, pp. 10-15, (2010); Fuchs E., Hess H., Kunz M., Injuries and chronic damages in classic ballet, Sportverletz Sportschaden, 17, 3, pp. 123-131, (2003); Teitz C.C., Hip and knee injuries in dancers, J Dance Med Sci, 4, pp. 23-29, (2000); Askling C., Lund H., Saartok T., Thorstensson A., Self-reported hamstring injuries in student dancers, Scand J Med Sci Sports, 12, 4, pp. 230-235, (2002); Brown T.D., Micheli L.J., Foot and ankle injuries in dance, Am J Orthop, 33, 6, pp. 303-309, (2004); Motta-Valencia K., Dance-related injury, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am, 17, 3, pp. 697-723, (2006); Rietveld B., Dance injuries in the older dancer: Comparison with younger dancers, J Dance Med Sci, 4, pp. 16-19, (2000); Wanke E.M., Zu Risiken und Nebenwirkungen des Tanzes, Tanzmedizin in Ausbildung und Beruf.

One response to the lack of supportive arts education policy is the Advanced Placement (AP) Studio Art Program, a visual arts assessment at the high school level that engages large numbers of students in rigorous art experiences. This article reviews the structure and characteristics of the AP portfolio assessment as a basis for critique and policy analysis. At issue are the reliability of this assessment’s measurements and its level of credibility with key constituencies.

We test the applicability of two theoretical approaches that explain the motivations that underlie public funding of the performing arts. One approach emphasizes the role of cultural policy in making the arts accessible to the wider public. The second approach emphasizes how cultural policy facilitates processes of hegemony-distinction. Using data from Israel, we document trends in the public funding of arts organizations in the domains of dance, orchestras, theater, and opera over a period of 48 years. Employing a time series analysis, we demonstrate how these trends in funding are associated with changes in level of education, ethnic composition, and level of income in the population. Our main conclusion is that in terms of how funding responds to changes in education and income-support for the performing arts in Israel benefits the wider public. However, in terms of how funding responds to changes in the size of ethnic groups-support for the performing arts in Israel caters to elite interests. This intricate set of relationships is discussed in the light of the two theoretical approaches. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Budget analysis; Cultural policy; Israel; Performing arts; Public funding","","","","","","Israel Science Foundation, ISF; Ministère de la Culture","Funding text 1: The authors collected data from documents available in the Israeli state archives and from official government publications. These documents list all of the artistic and cultural organizations in Israel that received funding from the Ministry of Culture in each given year. These organizations include, for example, orchestras, theaters, museums, dance companies, cinema institutions, and artists’ organizations. The funding is provided by the government for the ongoing operation of the arts organizations, without restrictions on specific uses. The sum allocated to each organization each year is specified in the contemporaneous currency. We chose 1960 as the first point of data because in 1959 the Public Council for Culture and Art was established, indicating the beginning of a systematic attendance to cultural affairs. Data for the years 1960–1987 were drawn from the state archives; data for 1991–1997 were obtained from published reports of the former Cultural Information Center (see Appendix A) and from Yalkut Hapirsumim (see Appendix A); and data for 1998–2009 were taken from reports published by the current Cultural Information Center, a research body under the Ministry of Culture (see Appendix A). Data for 1988–1990 and 1977, 1983, and 1985 are missing. Files for these years could not be located in the archives or in other publications, despite several attempts. In the variables section we discuss how we overcame these missing data points. We constructed a database that resembles a matrix with the names of all of the organizations that received funding from the Ministry of Culture by year of funding. Each cell represents the total sum granted in a specific year.

This paper applies a diffusion-equation model to the study of acoustics in coupled-rooms. Acoustical measurements are conducted on a scale-model of two coupled-rooms. Using the diffusion model and the experimental results the current work conducts in-depth investigations on sound pressure level distributions, providing further evidence supporting the valid application of the diffusion-equation model. Analysis of the results within the Bayesian framework allows for quantification of the double-slope characteristics of sound-energy decays obtained from the diffusion-equation numerical modeling and the experimental measurements. In particular, Bayesian decay analysis confirms sound-energy flux modeling predictions that time-dependent sound-energy flows in coupled-room systems experience feedback in the form of energy flow-direction change across the aperture connecting the two rooms in cases where the dependent room is more reverberant than the source room. © 2009 Acoustical Society of America.","","Acoustic fields; Acoustic variables measurement; Bayesian networks; Diffusion; Acoustical measurements; Bayesian; Bayesian frameworks; Complex geometries; Coupled-room; Diffusion model; Diffusion-equation models; Direction change; Energy decay; Energy flow; Energy flux modeling; Experience feedback; Experimental measurements; In-depth investigation; Numerical modeling; Performing arts; Scale-model; Sound fields; Sound pressure level; Time-dependent; acoustics; article; Bayes theorem; diffusion; prediction; priority journal; sound level measurement; sound pressure; Mathematical models","","","","","","","Jaffe J.C., Selective reflection and acoustic coupling in concert hall design, Proceedings of the Music and Concert Hall Acoustics, MCHA 1995, pp. 85-94, (1995); Johnson R., Kahle E., Essert R., Variable coupled volume for music performance, Proceedings of the Music and Concert Hall Acoustics, MCHA 1995, pp. 372-385, (1995); Jaffe J.C., Innovative approaches to the design of symphony halls, Acoustical Science and Technology, 26, 2, pp. 240-243, (2005); Xiang N., Goggans P.M., Evaluation of decay times in coupled spaces: Bayesian parameter estimation, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 110, 3, pp. 1415-1424, (2001); Summers J.E., Torres R.R., Shimizu Y., Estimating Mid-frequency Effects of Aperture Diffraction on Reverberant-Energy Decay in Coupled-Room Auditoria, BUILDING ACOUSTICS, 11, 4, pp. 271-292, (2004); Summers J.E., Torres R.R., Shimizu Y., Dalenback B.-I.L., Adapting a randomized beam-axis-tracing algorithm to modeling of coupled rooms via late-part ray tracing, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 118, 3, pp. 1491-1502, (2005); Meissner M., Computational studies of steady-state sound field and reverberant sound decay in a system of two coupled rooms, Cent.

The goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of different testing methods on the measured JND of clarity index for music (C80). An initial study was conducted to verify the findings of other published works that the C80 JND is approximately 1 dB, as currently listed in ISO 3382:2009 (International Organization for Standardization, Switzerland, 2009), however, the results suggested a higher value. In the second study, the effects of using two variations of the method of constant stimuli were examined, where one variation required the subjects to evaluate the pair of signals by listening to each of them in their entirety, while the second approach allowed the participants to switch back and forth in real-time. More consistent results were obtained with the latter variation and the results indicated a C80 JND greater than 1 dB. In the final study, an extensive training period using the first variation was required, based on the second study, and the data were collected using the second variation. The analysis revealed that for the conditions used in this study (concert hall and chamber music hall) that the C80 JND is approximately 3 dB. © 2015 Acoustical Society of America.","","Acoustics; Architectural acoustics; Testing; Chamber music; International organization for standardizations; Just-noticeable difference; Method of constant stimulus; Performing arts; Room acoustics; Second variation; Testing method; Image quality","","","","","","","Bork I., A comparison of room simulation software - The 2nd round robin on room acoustical computer simulation, Acta Acust., 86, pp. 943-956, (2000); Acoustics - Measurements of Room Acoustics Parameters - Part 1: Performance Spaces, (2009); Cox T.J., Davies W.J., Lam Y.M., The sensitivity of listeners to early sound field changes in auditoriums, Acustica, 79, 1, pp. 27-41, (1993); Bradley J.S., Reich R., Norcross S.G., A just noticeable difference in C-50 for speech, Appl.

Building on recent debate around the issue and following appropriately rigorous models, the importance of locating a suitable methodology to adequately reflect the integrated process of research practice in written as well as visual form is underlined. Exploring the role of the embodied practitioner and issues of subjectivity and description, I propose that the adoption of a performative writing strategy that reflects both the content and context of the enquiry can be a productive move and put forward alternative routes and references that might practically assist achievement of just such an aim. Critical references that can support such a framework are also suggested and examples of alternative writing strategies that might help underpin alternative dissemination frameworks indicated. © The Author(s) 2013.","Description; Embodiment; Performative writing; Practice-led research; Subjectivity; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Barrett E., Bolt B., Practice as Research, (2010); Macleod K., The function of the written text in practice-based PhD submissions, Working Papers in Art & Design 1, (2000); Macleod K., Holdridge L., Thinking Through Art, (2005); Miller D., Stuff, (2010); Phelan P., Mourning Sex, (1997); Smith H., Dean T., Practice-Led Research, Research-Led Practice in the Creative Arts, (2010); Thrift N., Steps to an ecology of place, Human Geography Today, pp. 295-322, (1999); Working Papers in Art & Design: The Functions of the Written Text in Practice-based PhD Submissions, (2000)","S.

It argues that the embodied observer proposed in fin-de-siecle optical science crucially influenced the form and goals of modernist impersonality, and charts two distinct phases in the development ofH.D.'s particular version of that aesthetic. In the first phase,H.D. looked to visual art and, inthe second, tofilmandpsychoanalysis, as modern visual discourses through which to explore the embodied and fundamentally impersonal nature of subjectivity. Through her visual languages, or 'imagetexts', she considered ultimately the implications of such a subjectivity for embodied identities like gender, sexuality, and race. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Cinema; H.D.; Image; Impersonality; Modernism; Psychoanalysis; Vision; Visual arts","","","","","","","","D H., The Usual Star, The Usual Star, (1934); Crary J., Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century, pp. 25-66, (1990); A Small History of Photography' (1931), One Way Street, pp. 240-257, (1979); The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction' (1936), Illuminations, pp. 217-251, (1969); Krauss R., The Optical Unconscious, (1993); Mandel C., Magical Lenses: Poet's Vision Beyond the Naked Eye, H.D.: Woman and Poet, pp. 301-317, (1986); Morris A., How to Live/ What to Do: H.D.'s Cultural Poetics, (2003); Buck C., H.D. & Freud: Bisexuality and a Feminine Discourse, (1991); Laity C., H.D. and the Victorian Fin-De-Siècle, (1996); Friedman S.S., Penelope's Web: Gender, Modernity, H.D.

Method: A mixed-methods, quasi-experimental, pre/post design to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a newly developed therapeutic, person-centred visual art intervention for people with dementia attending a day care centre or residing in an assisted living facility. Results: Five themes were identified from the interviews. Two themes reflected the feasibility/acceptability and the perceived impacts of the intervention, and three themes represented perceived successful elements: participant choice, socialisation and mentally stimulating activities. The quantitative data tentatively indicated enhanced social functioning and quality of life scores post-intervention. Conclusion: These findings indicate that engagement with visual art is effective for people with dementia, and taking into account the factors that impact on feasibility and acceptability will promote future robust evaluation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","creativity; Dementia; intervention evaluation; person-centred; visual arts","Dementia; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Quality of Life; dementia; feasibility study; human; quality of life","","","","","","","Bartholomew L.K., Parcel G.S., Kok G., Gottlieb N.H., Fernandez M.E., Planning health promotion programs: An intervention mapping approach, (2011); Bohlmeijer E., Roemer M., Cuijpers P., Smit F., The effects of reminiscence on psychological well-being in older adults: A meta-analysis, Ageing and Mental Health, 11, 3, pp. 291-300, (2007); Boyatzis R., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Brillantes-Evangelista G., An evaluation of visual arts and poetry as therapeutic interventions with abused adolescents, The Arts in Psychotherapy, 40, 1, pp. 71-84, (2013); Budgett J., Brown A., Daley S., Page T.E., Banerjee S., Livingston G., Sommerlad A., He social functioning in dementia scale (SF-DEM): Exploratory factor analysis and psychometric properties in mild, moderate and severe dementia, Alzheimer’s and Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment and Disease Monitoring, 11, pp. 45-52, (2019); Crabtree B., Miller W., A template approach to text analysis: Developing and using codebooks, (1999); Craig P., Dieppe P., Macintyre S., Michie S., Nazareth I., Petticrew M., Developing and evaluating complex interventions: The new Medical Research Council guidance, BMJ, 337, (2008); All party parliamentary groups on arts, (2017); De Medeiros K., Basting A., ‘Shall I compare thee to a dose of donepezil?’: Cultural arts interventions in dementia care research, The Gerontologist, 54, 3, pp. 344-353, (2014); Mental capacity act, (2005); Hsu M., Flowerdew R., Parker M., Fachner J., Odell-Miller H., Individual music therapy for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms for people with dementia and their carers: A cluster randomised controlled feasibility study, BMC Geriatrics, 15, (2015); IBM SPSS statistics for windows, Version 21.0, (2012); Johnson N., Barion A., Rademaker A., Rehkemper G., Weintraub S., The activities of daily living questionnaire: A validation study in patients with dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Associated Disorders, 18, 4, pp. 223-230, (2004); Lawton M.P., Brody E.M., Assessment of older people: Self-maintaining and instrumental activities of daily living, Gerontologist, 9, 3, pp. 179-186, (1969); Logsdon R.G., Gibbons L.E., McCurry S.M., Teri L., Quality of life in Alzheimer’s disease: Patient and caregiver reports, Journal of Mental Health and Ageing, 5, 1, pp. 21-32, (1999); Loizeau A., Kundig Y., Oppikofer S., ‘Awakened Art Stories’- Rediscovering pictures by persons living with dementia utilising TimeSlips: A pilot study, Geriatric Mental Health Care, 3, 2, pp. 13-20, (2015); Low L.F., Carroll S., Merom D., Baker J.R., Kochan N., Moran F., Brodaty H., We think you can dance!

The results of the principal components analysis refine the framework and demonstrate the following consumption motives: cultural aesthetics (with two dimensions: artistic value and enjoyment of beauty), cultural relaxation, cultural stimulation, social bonding, social attraction, social distinction, and social duty. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Consumption motives; cultural motives; framework; measurement tool; performing arts; social motives","","","","","","","","Arnould E., Thompson C., Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 4, pp. 868-882; Axelsen M., Visitor's Motivations to Attend Special Events at Art Galleries: An Exploratory Study, Visitor Studies, 10, 2, pp. 192-204; Belfiore E., Art as a Means of Alleviating Social Exclusion: Does it Really Work?

Australian and English children’s picture book authors and illustrators have adopted a similar focus, particularly regarding the Western Front. It is the illustrators, however, who have the more complex task, for they have inherited an aesthetic issue that has challenged artists since 1914. Like the British, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand official war artists of the time, they are confronted, at every turn, by the challenge of depicting a surreally empty landscape. It was not so much a landscape as the artists understood it before the war, but rather an anti-landscape, as though the war had annihilated Nature. What was left was a dystopian wilderness that bore witness to the destructive power of industrialised warfare. This article will explore how a selection of Australian and English children’s picture book illustrators respond to the emptiness of the battlefield landscape, or as Becca Weir so evocatively characterises it, the paradox of measurable nothingness. © 2023 Society for Landscape Studies.","Battlefield; children’s picture books; Great War; illustrators; landscape; visual arts; Western Front","","","","","","","","Anderson F., Trembath R., (2011); Andrews E.M., (1993); Avery G., (1989); Badsey S., (2009); Baguley M., Kerby M., ‘A beautiful and devilish thing: children’s picture books and the 1914 Christmas Truce’, Visual Communication, pp. 1-24, (2021); Bann S., (1984); Bean C.E.W., (1983); Bean C.E.W., (1928); Bedford A., Gehrmann R., Kerby M., Baguley M., Conflict and the Australian commemorative landscape, Hist Encounters, 8, 1, pp. 13-26, (2021); Bennett B., (2009); Bevan R., (2006); Billings B., Is Anzac Day an incidence of “Displaced Christianity?, Pacifica: Australasian Theological Stud, 28, 3, pp. 229-242, (2015); Bond B., (1997); Bond B., (2002); Brandon L., (2006); Burn I., (1990); Chouliaraki L., The humanity of war: iconic photojournalism of the battlefield, 1914–2012, Visual Communication, 12, 3, pp. 315-340, (2013); Clark A., (1961); Crocker T., (2015); Das S., Indian sepoy experience in Europe, 1914–1918: archive, language and feeling, Twentieth Century British Hist, 25, 3, pp. 391-417, (2014); Duffy C., Roberts D., (2014); Dyer G., (1995); Flothow D., ‘Popular children’s literature and the memory of the First World War 1919–1939’, The Lion and the Unicorn, 31, 2, pp. 147-161, (2007); Fussell P., (1977); Fromkin D., (2004); Gerster R., (1987); Gough P., (2010); Gough P., (2018); Gregory D., (2016); Hoffenberg P.H., Landscape, memory and the Australian war experience, 1915–18, J Contemporary Hist, 36, 1, pp. 111-131, (2001); Holbrook C., The role of nationalism in Australian war literature of the 1930s, First World War Studies, 5, 2, pp. 213-231, (2014); Holbrook C., Are we brainwashing our children?

It was a UK study; a collaboration between Liverpool and Glyndŵ University's and Tate Liverpool's learning team. Tate Liverpool is the home of the National Collection of Modern Arts in the North of England and one of the largest galleries of modern and contemporary art outside London. The project adapted Tate Liverpool's Opening Doors course in devising and piloting a single day programme that engaged students in exploring perception, communication, emotion and narrative. Opening Doors introduces participants to modern and contemporary art and empowers them to work in new ways with groups and individuals. The exercises used as part of the programme allowed us to observe what connections and interpretations were made, and to discuss with the participants what influenced student choice and decision making in relation to specific works of art. This article will focus on the use of gallery education to highlight examples of contemporary culture to develop links between art and medicine, alongside the development of transferable skills. The study is of professional interest because it is using a cross-disciplinary approach, broadening the disciplines involved in teaching medical skills; and could form a model for further cross-curricular and cross-discipline work. © 2012 The Authors. iJADE © 2012 NSEAD/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cross-disciplinary; Gallery education; Medical insight; Transferable skills; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Blaikie N., Approaches to Social Enquiry, (2007); Brown J.B., The use of focus groups in clinical research, Doing Qualitative Research, pp. 286-287, (1999); Charnock V., D'Silva S., Opening Doors: A new approach in person centred work in the Gallery, Tate Liverpool Opening Doors Course Evaluation, (2003); Cowling J., For Art's Sake?

The review focuses on empirical results in studies concerned with using dance and visual arts in poetry education and implications for poetry pedagogy in research and practice. The review encompasses 21 articles that were analysed thematically. The thematic analysis yielded seven themes: expand and deepen understandings of poetry; break curricular boundaries; interaction and collaboration; personal knowledge, reflection and experience; increase interest, motivation and confidence; challenges, limitations and constraints; and disciplinary knowledge. With research on this topic having increased in the 2010s, the findings show the potentials and challenges of using dance and visual arts in different ways in poetry education. Still, the research field is understudied, and many questions remain unanswered. Consequently, this study concludes with suggestions for future research on arts-based responses in poetry education. The study adds to the dialogue on poetry education and contributes to raising awareness of the possibilities and challenges of using dance and visual arts in the poetry classroom. © 2021 The Authors.

One can 'participate' (Goffman 1979, 1981) in an interaction in different statuses, and these statuses entail different interactional constraints and obligations, also within the realms of language aggression and conflict. We are interested in a specific aspect of participation, namely ratification - the assumed right to participate in an interaction. 'Ambiguity' describes forms of behaviour which deviate from participant and observer expectations of interacting in certain discursive roles, without clearly violating (un)ratified participation roles. Examining the relationship between participatory ambiguity and language aggression fills an important knowledge gap in the field, as this area has been relatively ignored.

Following Stella Bruzzi we argue that if documentary theory maintains objectivity as the primary measure of value, it will inevitably and continuously arrive at the conclusion that the documentary genre is fundamentally flawed. Instead, we propose to move beyond the ‘realist epistemology’ of documentary theory and focus on the ‘documentary real’, i.e. the specific performativity of the reality constructed in and by the documentary genre. In the last paragraphs, we introduce the various articles that address the “documentary real” in this special issue. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","","Performativity; Performing arts; Social sciences","","","","","","","Barthes R., The reality effect, In the Rustle of Language, pp. 141-148, (1986); Berrebi S., Documentary and the dialectical document in contemporary art, Right about now. art and theory since the 1990s, pp. 109-115, (2007); Bishop C., Artificial hells: Participatory art and the politics of spectatorship, (2012); Bruzzi S., New Documentary, (2006); Chanan M., The politics of documentary, (2008); Forsyth A., Megson C., Get real: Documentary theatre past and present, (2009); Irmer T., A search for new realities.

We recognize materials from shape, color and texture features. This paper is a selective review and discussion of how artists have been using shape features to evoke vivid impressions of specific materials and material properties. A number of examples are presented in which visual artists render materials or their transformations, such as soft human skin, runny or viscous fluids, or wrinkled cloth. They achieve this by expressing the telltale shape features of these materials and transformations, often by carving them from a single block of marble or wood. Vision research has just begun to investigate these very shape features, making material perception a prime example of how art can inform science. © 2019 Brill Academic Publishers.

In going 'backstage' to tell the story that lay behind an innovative theatre performance, this article foregrounds the process instead. In looking at the lengthy period of collaboration that underpinned the staging of the multi-media performance Trepang, it recovers an interesting experiment in intercultural artistic negotiation. Working with Indigenous and Makassan (Indonesian) performers to re-enact a story of first contact, Andrish Saint-Clare assumed the role of theatre director and creative intermediary. The fact that Hungarian-born Saint-Clare was 'outside' both of the communities he collabo- rated with raises interesting questions about the authenticity of history in performance. Bringing to both communities archetypal stories of his migrant experience, Saint-Clare found these serving as a catalyst out of which the Yolngu and Makassan communities found common ground to re-tell their stories. © 2008 International Australian Studies Association.","Indigenous-Asian theatre; Makassans; Performing arts; Trepang trade; Yolngu","","","","","","","","Gilbert H., Lo J., Performance and Cosmopolitics: Cross-Cultural Transactions In Australasia, pp. 209-211, (2007); The Outsiders Within, pp. 51-57; Mulvaney J., Kamminga J., Prehistory of Australia, Allen and Unwin, Sydney, (1999); Macknight C.C., Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers In Australia, (1976); Reynolds H., North of Capricorn: The Untold Story of Australia's North, (2003); Palmer L., Negotiating the ritual and social order through spectacle: The (re)production of Macassan/Yolrju histories, Anthro- Pological Forum, 17, 1, (2007); Stephenson, The Outsiders Within, pp. 51-52; Casey M., Syron L.-M., The challenges of benevolence: The role of Indigenous actors, Australian Studies Centre 25th Anniversary Collection, pp. 297-306, (2005); Stephenson, The Outsiders Within; Whykes A., Trepang: Indigenous Australians and Indonesians celebrate a shared story across the Arafura Sea: Alan Whykes interviews Andrish Saint-Clare, Inside Indonesia, (2006); Carter P., Lewis R., Depth of Translation: The Book of Raft, pp. 55-56, (1999); McIntosh I., A memorable trip to Makassar The Aboriginal Health Worker, Special Feature On Elcho Island, 13, 2, pp. 15-17, (1989); McIntosh I., Islam and Australia's Aborigines?

Evidence-based curriculum reformation has been advanced for a range of specific disciplines including law, medicine and performing arts. However, there is room for further advancement of intervention within other disciplines. In Australian contexts, there is limited research that provides an evidence-base for art curriculum reformation- to address the mental health and wellbeing needs of visual art students. This paper will discuss the author's current research, framed by the transformative paradigm, that seeks to represent the voices of visual art students by providing a needs assessment and recommendations for future curriculum reformation. By involving the students in decision-making processes of future intervention, sustainable, uniquely tailored techniques can be designed to enhance their wellbeing. In doing so, visual art students' academic achievements, including successful completion of their degree and transition into the workforce, may also be increased. © 2018 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Higher education; Mental health; Resilience; Visual arts; Wellbeing","","","","","","","","Arts and Culture in Australia: A Statistical Overview (no. 4172.0), (2014); Baik C., Larcombe W., Brooker A., Wyn J., Allen L., Field R., Brett M., James R., Enhansing Student Wellbeing, (2017); Becker G., The Association of Creativity and Psychopathology: Its Cultural-Historical Origins, Creativity Research Journal, 13, 1, pp. 45-53, (2001); Becker G., A socio-historical overview of the creativity-pathology connection: from antiquity to contemporary times, Creativity and mental illness, pp. 3-25, (2014); Bovill C., Cook-Sather A., Felten P., Students as co-creators of teaching approaches, course design, and curricula: implications for academic developers, International Journal for Academic Development, 16, 2, pp. 133-145, (2011); Carter M.A., Pagliano P., Francis A., Thorne M., Australian University Students and Mental Health: Viewpoints from the literature, International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, pp. 1-25, (2017); Cloonan D., Observations when counselling trainee artists, Journal of the Australian and New Zealand Student Services Association, 31, pp. 42-55, (2008); Comunian R., Faggian A., Li Q.C., Unrewarded careers in the creative class: The strange case of bohemian graduates, Papers in Regional Science, 89, 2, pp. 389-410, (2010); Daniel R., Exploring artistic identity and place in society: perspectives and insights from higher education students in Australia, Creative Industries Journal, 9, 1, pp. 15-28, (2016); Daniel R., Johnstone R., Frameworks for Building Artists' Resilience, International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, pp. 89-104, (2017); Egbo B., Emergent Paradigm: Critical Realism and transformative research in higher educational administration, McGill Journal of Education, 40, 2, pp. 267-284, (2005); Elias D.M.G., Berg-Cross L., An Exploration of Motivations of Fine Art Students in Relation to Mental and Physical Well-Being, Journal of College Student Psychotherapy, 23, 4, pp. 228-238, (2009); Evelina L., Julia C., Johanna W., Hernan C., Dan W., The Complex Relationship between Mental Health and Social Conditions in the Lives of Young Australians Mixing Work and Study, YOUNG, 25, 4, pp. 339-358, (2016); Eynde J., Fisher A., Sonn C., Working in the Australian Entertainment Industry: Final Report Retrieved from Entertainment Assist, (2016); Fernandez A., Howse E., Rubio-Valera M., Thorncraft K., Noone J., Luu X., Veness B., Leech M., Llewellyn G., Salvador-Carulla L., Setting-based interventions to promote mental health at the university: a systematic review, International Journal of Public Health, 61, 7, pp. 797-807, (2016); Field R., Final report of: Stimulating strategic change in legal education to address high levels of psychological distress in law students, (2014); Field R., Duffy J., Better to Light a Single Candle than to Curse the Darkness: Promoting Law Student Well-being through a First Year Law Subject, QUT law review, 12, 1, pp. 133-156, (2012); Greason D.P.B., Glaser T., Mroz K., Thinking Outside the Box: Psychological Needs of Art Students Compared With Traditional Students, Journal of College Student Psychotherapy, 29, 1, pp. 53-71, (2015); Gwinner K., Knox M., Hacking S., The place for a contemporary artist with a mental illness, Journal of Public Mental Health, 8, 4, pp. 29-37, (2009); Hassed C., de Lisle S., Sullivan G., Pier C., Enhancing the health of medical students: outcomes of an integrated mindfulness and lifestyle program, Advances in Health Sciences Education, 14, 3, pp. 387-398, (2009); Hassed C., Sierpina V.S., Kreitzer M.J., The Health Enhancement Program at Monash University Medical School, EXPLORE: The Journal of Science and Healing, 4, 6, pp. 394-397, (2008); Huddy A., Performance enhancement: A whole of person approach to first year Dance students' transition into tertiary training, Performance Enhancement & Health, 4, 1-2, pp. 27-34, (2016); Huppert F.A., So T.T.C., Flourishing Across Europe: Application of a New Conceptual Framework for Defining Well-Being, Social Indicators Research, 110, 3, pp. 837-1246, (2013); Kern M.L., Waters L.E., Adler A., White M.A., A multidimensional approach to measuring well-being in students: Application of the PERMA framework, The Journal of Positive Psychology, 10, 3, pp. 262-271, (2015); Lambert L., Passmore H.A., Joshanloo M., A Positive Psychology Intervention Program in a Culturally-Diverse University: Boosting Happiness and Reducing Fear, Journal of Happiness Studies, (2018); Larcombe W., Finch S., Sore R., Who's distressed?

The installation will occupy an entire room that measures 10x5 meters. We aim to create a digital musical instrument (DMI) that facilitates intuitive musical interaction, thereby enabling visitors to quickly start creating music either alone or together. The interface should be able to serve as a pedagogical tool; visitors should be able to learn about concepts related to music and music making by interacting with the DMI. Since the lifespan of the installation will be approximately five years, one main concern is to create an experience that will encourage visitors to return to the museum for continued instrument exploration. In other words, the DMI should be designed to facilitate long-term engagement. Finally, an important aspect in the design of the installation is that the DMI should be accessible and provide a rich experience for all museum visitors, regardless of age or abilities.

While ground truth refers to a set of remote sensing practices, it has a longer history in operational photography, such as aerial reconnaissance. Building on a discussion of this history, this article argues that ground truth has shifted from a reference to the physical, geographical ground to the surface of the images echoing earlier points raised by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that there is a ground of the image that is central to the task of analysis beyond representational practices. Furthermore, building on the practices of pattern recognition, composite imaging, and different interpretational techniques, we discuss contemporary practices of machine learning that mobilizes geographical earth observation datasets for experimental purposes, including tests such as “fake geography” as well as artistic practices, to show how ground truth is operationalized in such contexts of AI and visual arts. © 2020, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Machine vision; Operational image; Remote sensing; Visual culture","Antennas; Arts computing; Composite structures; Learning systems; Philosophical aspects; Remote sensing; Aerial reconnaissance; Composite imaging; Contemporary practices; Earth observations; Ground truth; Representational practices; Visual arts; Computer vision","","","","","Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (19-26865X)","The research has been supported by Czech Science Foundation funded project 19-26865X ""Operational Images and Visual Culture: Media Archeological Investigations"".

There is a need for self-administered, low-cost, and accessible interventions that facilitate wellbeing and growth. Methods: This study used a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design to investigate the effects of a two-week positivity-oriented photography intervention on wellbeing and posttraumatic growth in comparison to a control group. Participants were adults between the ages of 21 and 80 living in the UK recruited between May and August 2020 (n = 109). Results: After adjusting for baseline wellbeing, both wellbeing and PTG were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group following intervention completion, with this effect remaining similar at one-month follow-up. Conclusions: The study offers preliminary evidence that a brief self-administered photography intervention could hold therapeutic value. © 2022 The Author(s).

Using insights from management, marketing, entrepreneurship, and sociology, the authors develop a conceptual model for constructing a successful career, the Building Blocks of Artistic Careers model (BBAC). Pursuing such a career entails entrepreneurial and marketing skills, cultivation of relationships with art world gatekeepers, brand creation strategies, and reputation management.

By drawing on material from the practice and study of improvisation, as well as the humanities and social sciences, I examine the nature of improvisation and its relationship with urban life. Based on this approach, four key positions are proposed as foundational elements for an improvisation-based model of urban interaction design. A brief analysis examines this model in relation to three existing projects, and by using responsive urban lighting as an example, I illustrate how improvisation techniques can be employed to put into action the proposed key positions to guide the design of responsive urban environments. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.","Design models; Improvisation; Responsive environments; Urban interaction design","Design models; Foundational elements; Humanities and social science; Improvisation; Interaction design; Performing arts; Responsive environments; Urban environments; Urban planning","","","","","","","World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision, (2015); (2017); (2017); Digital Ground: Architecture, Pervasive Computing, and Environmental Knowing, pp. 47-64, (2005); Dubberly H., Pangaro P., Haque U., What Is Interaction?

Methods: Four reference databases were searched using relevant keyword combinations in order to examine how the visual and performing arts have been used to develop teamwork and communication skills among health professionals and what the outcomes were. Reference list checking was also conducted in order to identify other relevant articles not captured in the initial search strategy. Results: Many of the studies that we reviewed revealed that after participation in the arts, participants felt positively about the experience, had a greater awareness of the importance of teamwork and communication skills in their professional practice, and reported general improvements in these skills. Conclusions: While the initial results of this review seem promising, a concerted effort to conduct more methodologically sound studies on various art forms and their effect on the development of health professionals’ interpersonal skills is required. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arts;

This paper is based upon a collaborative research project with a group of 15 teachers from local schools which intended to develop and understand the process of a performance assessment for and of learning in the classroom through the summative analysis of a three-year action research endeavour. Data were collected from classroom observations, teachers' feedbacks, group discussions, focus group interviews and reflective notes. The findings suggested that an assessment for drama could be systematically constructed over time to balance the need for alignment between the formative and summative functions of assessments presented in the national guidelines. It was evident that the inclusion of teachers' voices in the process and a constant revision of the rubrics for assessment genuinely responsive to actual practices were key in developing a valid assessment process for drama and thus ensuring better learning quality in the drama programme. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","drama assessment; formative and summative assessment; performance assessment; performing arts; scoring rubrics","","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This three-year study was supported by the National Research Foundation collaborated with the research assistants, Chuan-Hwa Lin, Pei-Yin Yen and many teachers from local primary schools in Tainan and Kaohsiung.","Beane J., Curriculum integration-designing the core of democratic education, (1997); Black P., Wiliam D., Inside the black box: raising standards through classroom assessment, Phi Delta Kappan, 80, 2, pp. 139-148, (1998); Chao C.F., Design and development of web-based rubric processor for qualitative assessment and its effects: An example of writing assessment implemented in elementary school (Unpublished master's thesis), (2004); Chen S.Z., Model for curriculum transformation in 'Representation skill' of competence indicator in the social study area, Journal of Education Research, 86, pp. 86-100, (2002); How to create a rubric from scratch, (2000); Hong C., Unlocking dance and assessment for better learning, Assessment in arts education, pp. 27-37, (2006); Li K.C., Analyzing the concept of competence indicator in the learning area integrative activities, Journal of Education Research, 98, pp. 111-122, (2002); Lin M.C., The development and practices of curriculum in performing arts -action from a drama programme model, Curriculum and Instruction Quarterly, 9, 4, pp. 119-139, (2006); Lin M.C., The training of drama teachers through case method instruction (CMI), Research in Art Education, 17, pp. 1-38, (2009); Lin M.C., A performance assessment for a drama curriculum in elementary school-developing scoring rubrics for basic drama ability, Education Review, 34, pp. 179-222, (2010); Lin M.C., The construction of scoring rubrics for the performing art - Using primary grade on 'drama creation and application' as example, Contemporary Educational Research Quarterly Education, 18, 2, pp. 113-154, (2010); Lin M.C., The development of drama appreciation scoring rubrics and performance assessment tasks for 4th grade students, Research in Art Education, 21, pp. 1-31, (2011); Lo G.S., Chen M.Y., Wu Y.Y., An action research of a performance assessment design on assessing students' ability of conducting experiments, Contemporary Education Research Quarterly, 13, 4, pp. 95-132, (2005); Nitko A.J., Educational assessment of students, (2001); Ryan T.G., Performance assessment: Critics, criticism, and controversy, International Journal of Testing, 6, 1, pp. 97-104, (2006); She M.Y., Analysis of the alignment between competence indicators and the textbook of science and technology, (2002); Stiggins R.J., Student-centered classroom assessment, (1994); Taylor P., Assessment in arts education, (2006); Winston J., Beginning drama 4-11, (2009); Yang Z.S., The predicaments and improving strategies of the instructional supervision system in Taiwan, Curriculum and Instruction Quarterly, 2, 2, pp. 15-30, (1999); Yeh L.C., Transformation between the basic competence indicator and the nine-year joint curriculum, Journal of Education Research, 96, pp. 49-63, (2002)","M.-C.

Artists use their rich imagination and experience to combine light and objects to give viewers an unforgettable visual experience. However, the design process involves much trial and error; therefore, it is often very time-consuming. This has prompted many researchers to focus on proposing various algorithms to simplify the complicated design processes and help artists quickly realize the arts in their minds. To help computer graphics researchers interested in creating 3D visual optical art, we first classify and review relevant studies, then extract a general framework for solving 3D visual optical art design problems, and finally propose possible directions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D visual art; Automatic art design; Computational art; Optical art","Arts computing; Design; 3d visual art; Arts designs; Automatic art design; Computational art; Design problems; Design-process; Optical art; Trial and error; Visual arts; Visual experiences; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62025207)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 62025207.

This engagement is often explained with the desire to offer the French Muslim community an alternative to the ubiquitous secular mass culture deemed detrimental to a pious subjectivity. Because the offcial structures of the Islamic revival movement have for a long time adopted quite a restrictive stance with regard to cultural production, but also due to Muslims’ largely working class backgrounds in France, the young artists perceive their work in terms of educating the umma. In other words, they seek to develop a cultural or artistic sensibility that is nonetheless conducive to Islamic sensitivities. By examining three small performance art pieces produced by a young generation of pious Muslim artists from the Paris region, I hope to extend our understanding of Islamic sensory politics, as well as aesthetic and ethical practices, in a world where entertainment, leisure, and the culture industry are considered increasingly decisive for the sus-tainability of pious self-cultivation. © 2014 by the Institute for Ethnographic Research (IFER) a part of the George Washington University.

The Corago repository collects historical data and documentation about opera works, performances and librettos from the 16th to the 20th century. We experimented the use of semantic technologies to manage the repository’s knowledge catalogued following the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) relational model. Cultural Heritage Knowledge Bases (CHKB) as Corago could leverage SW and LD to overcome proprietary models and to introduce new information to better satisfy user’s requirements. Two well-established reference ontologies as CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) and FRBR Object Oriented (FRBRoo) are adopted to transpose contents form the legacy conceptual model to RDF. Through the process, we observed that formal semantics allow, not only to adequately represent the opera domain, but also enable to define the way information is being presented to users. This led to the definition of “reception pathways” which become themselves part of the knowledge about opera within the KB. This novel semantic approach is introduced with the Corago Semantic Model (Corago SM), a domain ontology dedicated to functional representation of opera’s historical data. Advancements have been tested with an experimental system and assessed through a questionnaire submitted to a panel of users. © 2021, Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo.

The process of typing a poem on the fly is captured and augmented to create an audiovisual performance that establishes natural links among the components of typing gestures, the poem being written on the fly, and audiovisual artifacts. Live writing draws upon ideas from the tradition of live coding in which the process of programming is revealed to the audience in real-time. This paper discusses the motivation behind the idea, interaction schemes and a performance interface for such a performance practice. Our live writing performance system is enabled by a custom text editor, writing-sound mapping strategies of our choice, a poem-sonification, and temporal typography. We describe two live writing performances that take different approaches as they vary the degree of composition and improvisation in writing. © remains with the author(s).","Live coding; Sonification; Web audio; Writing","Creative writings; Live coding; On-the-fly; Performance; Performing arts; Real- time; Sonifications; Web audio; Writing; Writing performance","","","","","","","Anderson L., The typewriter, (1950); Blackwell A., Collins N., The programming language as a musical instrument, Proceedings of PPIG05 (Psychology of Programming Interest Group), (2005); Brueckner S., Code that sings itself, (2011); Cabello R., Three. js, (2010); Choi H., Berger J., Waax: Web audio api extension, Proceedings of New Interfaces for Musical Expression, pp. 499-502, (2013); Collins N., McLean A., Rohrhuber J., Ward A., Live coding in laptop performance, Organised Sound, 8, pp. 321-330, (2003); Dietz P.

Moral elevation refers to the ability of prosocial acts to inspire people to engage in their own acts of charity and kindness. When morally elevating stories and visual depictions become traditional by being passed from one generation to the next, they can produce prosocial behavior advantageous to survival and reproduction among many generations of descendants. Traditions that increase the number of descendants in future generations can be seen as descendant-leaving strategies. Stories and visual depictions of the sacrifices of saints appear to be designed to produce states of moral elevation, and they have been transmitted from one generation to the next for many centuries. We propose that this ability of sacrificing saints to inspire future generations to engage in prosocial acts has contributed to the continuation and spread of Christianity. © 2013 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon.","Christianity;

From advertising to fine arts galleries, the visual arts play a visible role in how we view and understand the world. In this review, we consider research that speaks to whether our experiences with art can change the way we see. Numerous studies speak, often indirectly, to this question-addressing whether artists see things differently from nonartists. Specifically, we reviewed literature that investigates the ways artistic ability and artistic training interact with visual abilities from the perspective that artists can be described as experts in visual media. Some work suggests that those who identify as artists or undergo artistic training perform better than nonartists on measures of low-level vision, high-level perception, and visual cognition, and show differences in brain activity while engaged in perceptual or artistic tasks. Other studies do not support these conclusions, however, and report no differences between artists and nonartists. We conclude that experimentally designed and well controlled training studies are necessary to elucidate whether artistic training shapes the brain and its perceptual and cognitive processes or whether budding artists gravitate toward the visual arts because of existing visual abilities. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Artistic training; Expertise; Perception; Vision; Visual arts","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1640681)","","","","","American Psychological Association Inc.","","","","","","19313896","","","","English","Psychol.

In the context of post-pandemic recovery, this paper explores the notion of digital performance and proposes a framework for categorisation of digital skills currently associated with the digital making and sharing of performance work. It also aims to review the current digital skills offering in the performing arts training at Scottish universities and suggests strategies to drive accelerated digital skills development in performance education. Design/methodology/approach: Literature on digitalisations, digital skills and digital performance have been reviewed to provide the context and inform the proposed Digital Skills for Performance Framework. Subsequently, a pilot desk-based study selected 15 Scottish Higher Education Institutions in the area of performance and analysed their publicly available programme documentation for the presence of digital skills. Findings: While all of the programme specifications mentioned the use of “digital portfolios” and “digital performance”, there was little specific detail concerning “baseline” (transferable) and “specific” (technical) digital skills such as competency in the use of specific technologies. More notably, there was a complete absence of content relating to digital aesthetic identity. Originality/value: Upskilling future performance makers in digital competencies seems particularly important at present. This paper offers a useful categorisation of the digital skills in performing arts context, which higher education programmes can use to update their curricula, prepare the work-ready graduates and explore technological opportunities for the sector's long-term post-pandemic recovery. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital aesthetic identity; Digital performance; Digital skills; Higher education; Performing arts; Performing arts education","","","","","","","","Blake B., Theatre and the Digital, (2014); Karen, (2015); Brooks P., Performers creators and audience: co-participants in an interconnected model of performance and creative process, Research in Dance Education, 15, 2, pp. 120-137, (2014); Brown G., Hauck G., Convergence and creativity in telematic performance: the adding machine, Culture, Language and Representation, 6, pp. 101-119, (2008); Aesthetic, (2021); The economic impact of digital inclusion in the UK, (2018); COVID-19 Scottish creative sectors survey, (2021); Digital theatre and transformation: a case study and digital toolkit, (2020); UK Digital Strategy, (2017); (2020); Dixon S., Digital Performance: A History of New Media in Theater, Dance, Performance Art, and Installation, (2007); Ellerani P., Gentile M., The role of teachers as facilitators to develop empowering leadership and school communities supported by the method of cooperative learning, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 93, pp. 12-17, (2013); Professionally Made Professionally Paid, (2021); Florida R., The Rise of the Creative Class-Revisited: Revised and Expanded, (2014); Digital connectivity spend set to double in 2020/21 budget, (2020); Gal P., Nicoletti G., Renault T., Sorbe S., Timiliotis C., Digitalisation and productivity: in search of the holy grail–firm-level empirical evidence from EU countries, (2019); Kelly J., Three-way inter-play: devising processes and critical issues in station house opera's telematic performance, the other is you, Devising in Process, pp. 50-73, (2010); Klich R., Scheer E., Multimedia Performance, (2012); Mallett O., Marks A., Skountridaki L., Where does work belong anymore?

The training experience of students in the field of visual arts pedagogy, as a form of pedagogical action within the school setting, involves a series of factors that sanction and/or subvert norms that aim to preserve or transform the reality of children and adolescents through art. Based on the process of supervising the teaching practicums of eight teachers in Santiago, Chile, this article off ers a quantitative and qualitative analysis of their critical reflections on the following elements: body, time, space, materials, and the approach to content. We conclude that pedagogical action involves diverse actualizing and performative speech acts, which are accompanied by actions that traverse the gamut from the sanction to subversion of prevailing norms within the school setting. © 2018, Universidad de Concepcion.; La teoría de la performatividad contempla el cruce de numerosas disciplinas en torno a la tensa relación entre sanción y subversión a partir de la acción.

This multidisciplinary project brings together the arts and humanities with the social sciences with their different epistemological philosophies and subsequent understandings of research methods. The main objective was to determine how visual arts activities may change, sustain and catalyse community cultures, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours to create dementia-friendly communities. This project involves 6 different UK universities, 14 researchers, 10 formal partners, 7 project artists, 3 research artists and a large number of civil society organisations. The analysis presents a series of themes that have been identified as influencing the approach taken to develop methods which aimed to speak to different audiences in the social sciences, arts and humanities, policy/practice and public domains. It is concluded that a research project of this type needs to embrace a wide variety of epistemological positions if it is to successfully achieve its objectives. This paper contributes to knowledge about how the methodology of large-scale multidisciplinary projects may be constructed which will be of value to those building research consortia across different universities and between universities and community partners. © 2016 The Author(s).

Most research has focused on music and dance; less is known about the benefits of other arts interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of visual (ceramics and collage) and literary arts (storytelling and writing) on well-being. Methods: We used mixed methods to examine the effects of a 12-week visual or literary arts intervention on well-being. Adults age 55 and over from four housing sites were assigned to start an intervention immediately (intervention) or wait 12 weeks (controls). The study included pre/post-test measures of well-being and focus groups about perceived benefits.

Traditionally research has focused on biographical links between the composer and his music, encouraging the assumption that Schumann was solitary, divorced from reality, and frequently associated with ""untimeliness."" These eighteen chapters argue from a multitude of perspectives that Schumann was in fact very much a man of his time, informed not only by music but also the culture and society around him. The book further reveals that the composer's reputation has been shaped significantly by, for example, changes in attitudes toward German Romanticism and its history and recent developments in musical scholarship and performance. This book takes into account cultural and social institutional frameworks, engages with ongoing and new issues of reception and historiography, and offers fresh music-analytical insights. As a whole the chapters assemble a portrait of the artist that reflects the different ways Schumann has been understood and misunderstood over the past two hundred years. The volume is, in short, a timely reassessment of this ultimately non-untimely figure's legacy. While the chapters consider some of Schumann's most famous music (Dichterliebe, Kinderszenen, and the Piano Quintet), they also provide crucial adjustment to negative evaluations of the composer's later works by explaining their musical features not as the result of diminishing creative capacity but as reflections of the political and social situations of mid-19th-century German culture and technological developments. Schumann is revealed to have been a musician engaged by and responsive to his surroundings, whose reputation was formed to a great extent by popular culture, both in his own lifetime as he responded to particular poets and painters, and later, as his life and works were responded to by subsequent generations. © 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Much of the focus in arts education research, however, has explored adult attitudes, resulting in what seems the invisibility of young children’s opinions. Conducted in the context of early childhood education in Australia, the study, following a phenomenological approach, sought to understand the place of visual arts in the lives of four young children aged five to six years in a combined Kindergarten/Year One classroom located in Sydney. A range of childsensitive research tools were adapted from the ‘Mosaic approach’ to explore how children understand and conceive their early experiences of visual arts learning. In acknowledging the views of children, possibilities for improving arts pedagogy were considered as new questions emerged. The study confirmed the need to acknowledge and validate children’s rich and perceptive attitudes through meaningful experiences and valued conversations. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.","Art education; Attitudes; Children’s voices; Early primary setting; Surrealism; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Alexander R., (2009); Anderson D., Piscitelli B., Weier K., Everett M., Tayler C., Children’s museum experiences: Identifying powerful mediators of learning, Curator, 45, 3, pp. 213-231, (2002); Ashworth P., Lucas U., Achieving empathy and engagement: A practical approach to the design, conduct and reporting of phenomenographic research, Studies in Higher Education, 25, 3, pp. 295-308, (2000); Baird K., Exploring a methodology with young children: Reflections on using the mosaic and ecocultural approaches, Australasian Journal of Early Childhood, 38, 1, pp. 35-40, (2013); Bamford A., The Wow Factor: Global Research Compendium on the Impact of the Arts in Education, (2006); Barrett M., Smigiel H., Awakening the “sleeping giant”?: The arts in the lives of Australian families, International Journal of Education and the Arts, 4, 4, pp. 1-9, (2003); Barrett M., Everett M., Smigiel H., Meaning, value and engagement in the arts: Findings from a participatory investigation of young Australian children’s perception of the arts, International Journal of Early Childhood, 40, 2, pp. 85-201, (2012); Boone J., Young children’s experience of visual displays of their artwork, Australian Art Education, 31, 2, pp. 22-45, (2008); Brown R., What art practices enable children to be, become and belong as cultural citizens?

Degas has done a careful study, realistically depicting the movement both in his paintings of scenes of horses, women bathing and dancing, and in his sculptures of dancers in various positions of classical ballet. Since movements exist only at the intersection space-time, and visual works of art exist only in physical spaces defined by the works themselves, this article discusses the perception of time in the work of Degas. Therefore, this paper emphasizes aspects of the representation of movement used by the artist and the implied relations of these aspects with the perception of time. The timing perception is addressed according to studies that revealed components of the subjective perception of time related to a meeting of an observer with a work of visual art (aesthetic episode). © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Degas; movement; subjective time; Timing; visual arts","","","","","","","","Achcar D., Ballet: Arte, Técnica, Interpretação.

It demonstrates a new paradigm for the visual representation of constraint programming that may be appropriate to future generations of keyboardless and touchscreen devices. The current application domain is that of creative image manipulation, although the paradigm can support a wider range of computational expression. The combination of constraint semantics expressed via a novel image-layering metaphor provides a new approach to supporting a gradual slope of abstraction from direct manipulation to behaviour specification.

The way in which the visual arts impact luxury brand value is analyzed using the Customer-Based Brand Equity model, tested based on the strategy implemented by Louis Vuitton, the world’s top luxury brand. A between-subjects randomized experiment and manipulated art presence (the perception of art vs. non-art) found that the Louis Vuitton brand stimulates different consumer perceptions, depending on the presence or absence of art–brand collaboration and its explicit communication to final con-sumers. The results show that active collaboration between the brand and the art world positively affects brand association by sidestepping any loss in perceived quality and brand awareness. Brand loyalty is stimulated instead by a thorough explanation of the art-based collaboration.

Critical artistic and creative examinations of the interfaces between urbanization, society, culture, arts and people in Chinese cities have produced a great variety of new visual forms and agencies. In this introductory essay, we argue that the complexities of reciprocal relationship between urbanization and the visual arts deserve greater scholarly attention than they have been given so far, and we call for continuous and multiple-perspective research into the subject. The visual arts not only mirror the city but they actively participate in city-making processes. The investigation of artists, filmmakers and urbanites into the changing urban space in which they live has given birth to a post-socialist urban aesthetics, which, as Robin Visser proposes, functions as a new realm to envision, experience and assess the city. In doing so, it enables new forms of civic agencies to emerge. Visual art, as indicated by Yomi Braester in his study of Chinese films, interacts with political decisions and architectural plans, creating both material and ideological constructs of the cities. We maintain that the varied forms of visual arts and agencies discussed in this special issue not only reveal and interpret how the processes of globalization and urbanization are interrelated, but also participate in the reconstruction of sociospatial relationships and the reconceptualization of the city at local, national, and even global levels. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","aesthetics;

Since the implementation of the Hong Kong New Senior Secondary Curriculum in 2009, art educators have seen responding to artworks as increasingly important. In this context, the Art Criticism Assessment Rubric (ACAR) was developed. On the basis of Feldman's and Geahigan's theories of art criticism, eight evaluation criteria were identified. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the ACAR was examined. A preliminary IRR test was conducted and an excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) value of.91 was obtained. For the main study, six independent raters, who were divided into three groups of two, were trained and invited to rate 87 art criticism essays written by students from eight secondary schools. Most dimensions of the ACAR achieved good ICC values. The results show that the ACAR is an acceptable rubric for providing a reliable assessment of students’ written responses to artworks. However, two dimensions, Originality and Balanced Views and Application of Aesthetic and Contextual Knowledge, obtained poor ICC values. This may be owing to the lack of consensus on the definition of originality and the raters' unfamiliarity with the concept of aesthetic knowledge. The researchers suggest that dimension-specific samples rated from high to low scores should be provided in raters’ training. © 2017 The Author. iJADE © 2017 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd","art criticism; assessment; inter-rater reliability; rubric; validation; visual arts","","","","","","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (18405014)","This research was supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the General Research Fund (Project number: 18405014).","Arter J.A., Chappuis J., Creating & Recognizing Quality Rubrics, (2007); Barkan M., Transition in art education: changing conceptions of curriculum content and teaching, Art Education, 15, 7, pp. 12-18, (1962); Barrett T., Criticizing Art: Understanding the Contemporary, (1994); Barrett T., Interpreting Art: Reflecting, Wondering, and Responding, (2002); Bell C., Art, (1914); Bell D., Conversations for appreciating art: looking, talking and understanding, Australian Art Education, 33, 1, pp. 29-43, (2010); Cicchetti D.V., Guidelines, criteria, and rules of thumb for evaluating normed and standardized assessment instruments in psychology, Psychological Assessment, 6, 4, pp. 284-290, (1994); Clark G., Day M., Greer W.D., Discipline-based art education: becoming students of art, Journal of Aesthetic Education, 21, 2, pp. 129-193, (1987); Clark T.J., Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution, (1973); Art Criticism Paper Rubric (online); Visual Arts: Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Secondary 4–6), (2007); Cyr P.R., Smith K.A., Broyles I.L., Holt C.T., Developing, evaluating and validating a scoring rubric for written case reports, International Journal of Medical Education, 5, pp. 18-23, (2014); Duh M., Zupancic T., Cagran B., Development of art appreciation in 11–14 year-old students, International Journal of Art & Design Education, 33, 2, pp. 208-222, (2014); Feldman E.B., Varieties of Visual Experience, (1992); Forker M., The use of a diagnostic profile in assessing the art understandings of Taiwanese ESL Students, Research in Arts Education, 27, pp. 101-140, (2014); Geahigan G., Models of critical discourse and classroom instruction: a critical examination, Studies in Art Education, 41, 1, pp. 6-21, (1999); Haanstra F., Schonau D.W., Evaluation research in visual arts education, International Handbook of Research in Arts Education, pp. 427-442, (2007); Hallgren K.A., Computing inter-rater reliability for observational data: an overview and tutorial, Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 8, 1, pp. 23-24, (2012); Heid K., Care, sociocultural practice, and aesthetic experience in the art classroom, Visual Arts Research, 34, 1, pp. 87-98, (2008); Marking Scheme of Visual Arts Paper 1 (Visual Presentation of a Theme), (2014); House N., Using critiques in the K-12 classroom, Art Education, 61, 3, pp. 48-51, (2008); Ishizaki K., Wang W.C., Considering the framework of art appreciation repertoires, International Journal of Education Through Art, 6, 3, pp. 327-341, (2011); Jonsson A., Svingby G., The use of scoring rubrics: reliability, validity and educational consequence, Educational Research Review, 2, 2, pp. 130-144, (2007); Knutson K., Crowley K., Russell J., Steiner M., Approaching art education as an ecology: exploring the role of museums, Studies in Art Education, 2, 4, pp. 310-322, (2011); Lekue P., Artistic understanding and motivational characteristics, International Journal of Art & Design Education, 34, 1, pp. 44-59, (2015); Lowenfeld V., Brittain W., Creative and Mental Growth, (1987); Munro T., Art Education: Its Philosophy and Psychology: Selected Essays, (1956); Quinlan A.M., A Complete Guide to Rubrics: Assessment Made Easy for Teachers, K-College, (2006); Rickinson M., May H., A Comparative Study of Methodological Approaches to Reviewing Literature, (2009); Reddy Y.M., Andrade H., A review of rubric use in higher education, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 35, 4, pp. 435-448, (2010); Saussure F., Course in General Linguistics, (1959); Stavropoulos C.S., A diagnostic profile of art understandings based on verbal responses to works of art, Marilyn Zurmuehlen Working Papers in Art Education, 11, 1, pp. 48-53, (1992); Tam C.O., Lau C.Y., Patterns of art criticism of senior high school students in an examination context, Research in Arts Education, 20, pp. 1-31, (2010); Tolstoy L., What is Art?, (1930); Wolff T.F., Geahigan G., Art Criticism and Education, (1997)","","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","14768062","","","","English","Int.

The participants were involved throughout the project, preparing and curating artwork for a major public exhibition. Methods: Qualitative data were collected to explore meanings of the project from the perspective of participants, the project manager and the public, using interviews, participant observation and comment cards. Results: The project was successful in engaging the participants who had previously often felt excluded from mainstream art spaces. Findings about the benefits of arts participation echoed other studies but participants highlighted some difficulty with the ending of the project. Public perceptions were positive, acclaiming the thought-provoking quality of the exhibition. Interviews and participant observation revealed the importance of egalitarian leadership, mutual trust and the absence of any therapeutic agenda. Conclusion: Developing similar projects would offer opportunities to foster diverse artistic communities and empower people with experiences of disability and mental health conditions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","health promotion; mental health; visual arts","","","","","","National Lottery Heritage Fund","This paper reports on the evolution and development of a three year community arts project, “Ways of Seeing” which was based in the Lightbox, a public museum and art gallery in Woking, United Kingdom. The project was well publicised and is named here with the full agreement of the museum staff and participants. It was initiated by the museum director and staff and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Local people who took part were long-term users of mental health services with diagnoses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and in some cases, physical and psychological impairments resulting from head injury. During the project, they took part in introductory gallery visits; taster workshops followed by more in-depth art techniques (painting, drawing, print-making, sculpture); selected items from the large privately owned Ingram art collection housed within the Museum, and created their own responses to these items. It resulted in a successful major art exhibition. The impact of the project was explored independently by a research team of occupational therapists and a health psychologist from Brunel University London.","Great art and culture for everyone: 10 year strategic framework, (2013); Ashford P., Conceptual foundations of qualitative psychology, Qualitative psychology: A practical guide to research methods, pp. 4-25, (2008); Barnes C., Mercer G., Exploring disability, (2010); Beresford P., Beyond the usual suspects – towards inclusive user involvement, (2013); Berger J., Blomberg S., Fox C., Dibb M., Hollis R., Ways of seeing, (1972); Bryant W., Wilson L., Lawson J., “Ways of Seeing” evaluation, (2011); Caldwell N., The Whipple “Time-clock” experiment: Measurement of visitor engagement in a small museum, (2005); Camic P.M., Chatterjee H.J., Museums and art galleries as partners for public health interventions, Perspectives in Public Health, 133, pp. 66-71, (2013); Colbert S.M., Cooke A., Camic P.M., Springham N., The art-gallery as a resource for recovery for people who have experienced psychosis, The Arts in Psychotherapy, 40, pp. 250-256, (2013); Craze A., From asylum to community care.

Fostering a long-term relationship with clients is regarded a vital solution to a survival-related predicament these organizations face. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of four marketing tactics – personalization, two-way communication, preferential treatment, and rewarding – on the dimensions of customer relationship, namely, satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Design/methodology/approach: – Data to test the various research hypotheses were collected through a survey with 252 clients of a performing arts venue in a Dutch city. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: – Results reveal that extension of rewards to and maintaining a two-way communication with clients of a performing arts venue positively influence their satisfaction with, trust in, and commitment to the performing arts venue. Personalization of services impacts commitment only. However, the effect of preferential treatment on the three relationship dimensions is not statistically significant. Additionally, analysis shows that satisfied customers are more likely to trust the performing arts venue, although clients’ satisfaction with and trust in the performing arts venue do not influence their commitment to the venue. Originality/value: – Research into the ways to strengthen customer relationships in the performing arts is still scarce. The current research aims at investigating the impact of several marketing tactics on customer relationship measured in terms of satisfaction, trust, and commitment and shows how performing arts venues can strengthen their bonds with customers. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Customer relationship; Marketing tactics; Performing arts; Satisfaction; Trust","","","","","","","","Anderson E., Fornell C., Lehmann D., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: findings from Sweden, Journal of Marketing, 58, 3, pp. 53-66, (1994); Anderson J., Gerbing D., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Arora N., Dreze X., Ghose A., Hess J.D., Iyengar R., Jing B., Joshi Y., Kumar V., Lurie N., Neslin S., Sajeesh S., Su M., Syam N., Thomas J., Zhang Z.J., Putting one-to-one marketing to work: personalisation, customization, and choice, Marketing Letters, 19, 3-4, pp. 305-321, (2008); Aurier P., N'Goala G., The differing and mediating roles of trust and relationship commitment in service relationship maintenance and development, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 3, pp. 303-325, (2010); Bagozzi R.P., Reflections of relationship marketing in consumer markets, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 23, 4, pp. 272-277, (1995); Ball A., Coelho P., Vilares M., Service personalisation and loyalty, Journal of Services Marketing, 20, 6, pp. 391-403, (2006); Bentler P., Fit indexes, Lagrange multipliers, constraint changes and incomplete data in structural models, Multivariate Behavioral Research, 25, 2, pp. 163-172, (1990); Berry L., Relationship marketing of services – growing interest, emerging perspectives, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 23, 4, pp. 236-245, (1995); Bollen K., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Browne M., Cudeck R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit, (1993); Caceres R., Paparoidamis N., Service quality, relationship satisfaction, trust, commitment and business-to-business loyalty, European Journal of Marketing, 41, 7-8, pp. 836-867, (2007); Chaudhuri A., Holbrook M., The chain of effects from brand trust and brand affect to brand performance: the role of brand loyalty, Journal of Marketing, 65, 2, pp. 81-93, (2001); Chiou J., Droge C., Service quality, trust, specific asset investment, and expertise: direct and indirect effects in a satisfaction-loyalty framework, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34, 4, pp. 613-627, (2006); De Wulf K., Odekerken-Schroeder G., Iacobucci D., Investment in consumer relationships: a cross-country and cross-industry exploration, Journal of Marketing, 65, 5, pp. 33-50, (2001); Dorotic M., Bijmolt T., Verhoef P., Loyalty programs: current knowledge and research directions, International Journal of Management Reviews, 14, 3, pp. 217-237, (2011); Duncan T., Moriarty E., A communication-based marketing model for managing relationships, Journal of Marketing, 62, 2, pp. 1-13, (1998); Dwyer F., Schurr P., Oh S., Developing buyer-seller relationships, Journal of Marketing, 51, 2, pp. 11-27, (1987); Fan H., Poole M., What is personalisation?

One of these is that copyright lacks much in the way of a central concept of 'visual art' and, to the extent that it embraces any concept of the 'visual', it is rooted in the rhetorical discourse of the Renaissance. This means that copyright is poorly equipped to deal with modern developments in the visual arts. Secondly, the pervasive effect of rhetorical discourse appears to have made it particularly difficult for copyright law to strike a meaningful balance between protecting creativity and permitting its use in further creative works. Thirdly, just when rhetorical discourse might have been useful in identifying the significance and materiality of the unique one-off work of visual art, copyright law chooses to ignore its implications. © 2008 SAGE Publications.","Copyright; Creativity; Film; Law; Rhetorical discourse; Semiotic discourse; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Armstrong E., Before Copyright: The French Book Privilege System 1498-1526, (1990); Bently L., Sherman B., Intellectual Property Law, (2001); Blakeney M., Macmillan F., Journalistic Parody and Moral Rights under Australian Copyright Law, Media & Arts Law Review, 3, (1998); Bloom H., The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry, (1973); Boggs J.S.C., Who Owns This?, Chicago - Kent Law Review, 68, (1993); Bonnett A., Art, Ideology and Everyday Space: Subversive Tendencies from Dada to Postmodernism, Society and Space, 10, (1992); Bowrey K., Copyright, the Paternity of Artistic Works and the Challenge Posed by Postmodern Artists, Intellectual Property Journal, 8, (1994); Chilvers I., A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art, (1999); Eco U., Art & Beauty in the Middle Ages, (1986); Hutcheon L., The Politics of Postmodernism, (1989); Julius A., Transgressions: The Offences of Art, (2002); Kant I., Von der Unrechtmaßigkeit der Buchernachdrucks, Berlinische Monatsschrift, 5, pp. 403-417, (1785); Landau D., Parshall P., The Renaissance Print 1470-1550, (1994); Landes W., Copyright, Borrowed Images and Appropriation Art: An Economic Approach, Copyright in the Cultural Industries, (2002); Macmillan Patfield F., Towards a Reconciliation of Free Speech and Copyright, The Yearbook of Media and Entertainment Law 1996, (1996); Netanel N.W., Copyright and a Democratic Civil Society, Yale Law Journal, 106, (1996); Panofsky E., Idea: A Concept in Art Theory, (1968); Pon L., Raphael, Dürer & Marcantonio Raimondi: Copying & the Italian Renaissance Print, (2004); Rosand D., Murano M., Titian & the Venetian Woodcut (Exhibition Catalogue), (1976); Sherman B., Appropriating the Postmodern: Copyright and the Challenge of the New, Dear Images: Art, Copyright and Culture, (2002); Stapleton J., Art, Intellectual Property & the Knowledge Economy, (2002); Sterling J.A.L., World Copyright Law, (2003); Stokes S., Art & Copyright, (2001); Teilmann S., Framing the Law: Authorship of Images, Crossroads in Cultural Studies Conference, (2002); Towse R., Creativity, Incentive and Reward: An Economic Analysis of Copyright and Culture in the Information Age, (2001); Vaidhyanathan S., Copyrights & Copywrongs: The Rise of Intellectual Property & How It Threatens Creativity, (2001); Van Caenegem W., Copyright, Communication and New Technologies, Federal Law Review, 23, (1995); Waldron J., From Authors to Copiers: Individual Rights & Social Values in Intellectual Property, Chicago - Kent Law Review, 69, (1993); Wilson A., ""This Is Not by Me"": Andy Warhol and the Question of Authorship, Dear Images: Art, Copyright and Culture, (2002)","F.

It reports on a study of 564 Annual Reports produced between 2010 and 2018 by Australia's federal arts funding body, as well as leading subsidised performing arts companies. Identifying three main relationships between sustainability and the arts (sustainability through, in, and of the arts), I argue that Australia's performing arts sector is chiefly concerned with ‘sustainability of the arts.’ This concern focuses on the financial and organisational viability of arts companies, the ability of artists to make a living from their art, and the ongoing relevance and vibrancy of individual art forms. However, scant attention is paid to the environment, except as required under government legislation and in select performing arts companies. I discuss these findings in relation to Australia's recent history of arts funding and the argument that ‘culture’ should be recognised as a ‘fourth bottom line’ of sustainability. © 2021","Annual reports; Culture; Keywords; Performing arts; Sustainability","","","","","","University of Queensland, UQ","This research was supported by The University of Queensland.

In several contemporary circus arts disciplines, the consequences of accidents may involve severe injuries or death. In this article, we explore perceived risks, personality, experiences of sensation, emotion regulation, and agency in relation to accidents and near misses in contemporary circus arts (N = 248). A pathway analysis revealed that perceived risk, personality, and emotion regulation covary and together affect the likelihood of accidents and near misses in contemporary circus arts. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that contemporary circus arts consist of a heterogeneous group of discipline categories. Floor acrobats experienced significantly more accidents than aerial acrobats and object manipulators, and aerial acrobats experienced significantly more emotion regulation and agency than object manipulators. Further, aerial acrobats scored significantly higher on the personality traits conscientiousness and agreeableness than object manipulators. Our study reinforces the centrality of emotion regulation to safe performance in contemporary circus arts. Practitioners in performing arts, and circus in particular, are recommended to tailor safety interventions to the circus category and the artists’ personality-specific needs.

Box 9104, Netherlands","Performing styles as well as recording styles have changed considerably within the 20th century. To what extent do the age of a recording, the unfamiliarity with performing style, and the quality of a reproduction of a recording systematically influence how we perceive performances on record? Four exploratory experiments were run to formulate an answer to this question. Each experiment examined a different aspect of the perception of performance, including judgments of quality, perceived emotion, and dynamics. Fragments from Die junge Nonne sung by famous singers from the start, middle, and second half of the 20th century were presented in a noisy and clean version to musically trained participants. The results show independence of perception of emotional activity from recording date, strong dependence of perceived quality and emotional impact on recording date, and only limited effects of reproduction quality. Standards have clearly changed, which influence judgments of quality and age. Additionally, changes restrict the communication between early recorded performers and modern listeners to some extent as shown by systematically smaller variations in communicated dynamics and emotional valence for older recordings. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.","","Adult; Auditory Perception; Compact Disks; Copying Processes; Emotions; History, 20th Century; Humans; Judgment; Music; Noise; Computer music; Personnel training; Speech communication; article; auditory response; controlled study; decision making; emotion; emotional attachment; hearing; human; music; noise reduction; normal human; performance; performing arts; priority journal; quality control; reproducibility; Commercial recordings; Recording styles; Sound recording","","","","","Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Research Centre"," This research was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM).

This article reports on an investigation of the role primary school visual arts programs, distinct programs with a specialist teacher, in a designated art room, can play in supporting EAL students’ identity construction and social transition. At six Melbourne primary schools, classroom observations and teacher and student interviews revealed that the visual art programs offer clear possibilities for enhanced and empowered constructions of identity. This article focuses on four students as case studies, highlighting the powerful role visual arts programs, classrooms and teachers can play in EAL learners’ identity construction. On a personal and societal level, identity construction and a positive sense of self are essential in our current era of increased linguistic and cultural pluralism, and this study offers insights into how these inclusive goals can be achieved.

The authors attempt to comprehensively profile segments within frequent arts consumers and to define differentiated marketing mix and positioning approaches that can integrate more focused relationship marketing strategies. A survey was administered to 835 persons. The responses along 22 motivational variables were subjected to factor analysis. Cluster analysis was then applied to the factor scores of frequent performing arts consumers only. Attendance was found to be influenced by six motivating factors: Personal, distribution, economic, promotional, product and social. Also, frequent consumers were found to comprise three distinct segments: Congenial, convenience and intrinsic. The congenial group was most influenced by the social benefits of attending performing arts events. Convenience consumers were the most drawn to distribution offerings. Intrinsic consumers were most influenced by personal benefits derived from the core product and economic incentives such as reasonable ticket prices.","frequent consumers; performing arts; relationship marketing; Segmentation","","","","","","","","Andreasen A.R., Belk R.W., Predictors of attendance at the performing arts, Journal of Consumer Research, 7, 2, pp. 112-120, (1980); Andreea C., Attending live performing arts experiences: Why and how is the decision taken?, Annals of Faculty of Economics, 1, 1, pp. 1119-1126, (2012); Andreini D., Pedeliento G., Signori S., CSR and service quality in nonprofit organizations: The case of a performing arts association, International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, 19, 2, pp. 127-142, (2014); Bansal H.S., Irving P.G., Taylor S.F., A three-component model of customer commitment to service providers, Academy of Marketing Science Journal, 32, 3, pp. 234-250, (2004); Boerner S., Moser V., Jobst J., Evaluating cultural industries: Investigating visitors' satisfaction in theatres, Service Industries Journal, 31, 6, pp. 877-895, (2011); Bourdieu P., The social space and the genesis of classes, Actes de la Recherche en Sciences Sociales, 52, 5, pp. 3-15, (1984); Boyle S., Single serve or package deal?.

A case is made for the critical importance of Frank O'Hara's writing of affect as performance. O'Hara's development of writing as a performance art opens up a theatre of writing between poetry and other arts, assimilating analogies not just with painting but with diverse performing arts from ballet to Hollywood. His theatre of affects dramatises the sociality involved in being a poet, performing a writing praxis that maps being a writer onto the social being of writing. O'Hara generates a poetics of informality resistant to formalism that can appear occasional and conversational. His apparent improvisation of performance over being offers intimate engagements with prescripted forms of social being. Indebted to models suggested by Vladimir Mayakovsky, O'Hara's poetics suggest new critical perspectives on the mediation of feeling through the performance of writing. This essay sketches new critical models for reading O'Hara and draws out arguments for a deeper reorientation in the poetics of affect and performance, suggesting the need for more sustained recognition of the poetics of performance culture through which 'performativity' might be recognised. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","artifice; Frank O'Hara; Marcel Proust; performance culture; performance poetics; performing arts; social being; Vladimir Mayakosky","","","","","","","","Proust M., À la Recherche du Temps Perdu, (1999); O'Hara F., Renaissance, The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara, pp. 55-56, (1995); Beckett S., Proust and Three Dialogues, (1931); Shaw L., Frank O'Hara: The Poetics of Coterie, (2006); Attridge D., The Singularity of Literature, (2004); Ngai S., Ugly Feelings, (2005); Clough P.T., Halley J., The Affective Turn: Theorizing the Social, (2007); Flatley J., Affective Mapping: Melancholia and the Politics of Modernism, (2008); Mottram E., Frank O'Hara, American Poetry: The Modernist Ideal, pp. 143-166, (1995); Perloff M., Frank O'Hara: Poet among Painters, (1998); Ferguson R., In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art, (1999); Breslin J.E.B., Frank O'Hara, Popular Culture and American Poetry in the 1950s, Made in U.S.A.: An Americanization in Modern Art, the '50s & '60s, pp. 212-219, (1987); Ranciere J., The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible, (2004); Bourriaud N., Relational Aesthetics, (2002); Fried M., Art and Objecthood, Art and Objecthood, (1998); Kane D., We Saw the Light: Conversations between the New American Cinema and Poetry, (2009); Gooch B., City Poet: The Life and Times of Frank O'Hara, (1993); Mayakovsy V., I Myself, Mayakovsky, pp. 75-93, (1965)","","","Routledge","","","","","","0950236X","","","","English","Textual Pract.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958047300"

The way AACR and the Anglo-American cataloging tradition deals with performing arts is discussed at length. Conversely, specialized institutions have developed their own rules for the description of live performances: the Dance Heritage Coalition (New York) creates authority records for choreographic works, and the Ddpartement des Arts du Spectacle at Bibliothéque nationale de France creates bibliographic records for theatrical, operatic, and choreographic performances. As a conclusion, a tentative modeling of performing arts as bibliographic entities, strictly based on FRBR, is proposed. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

How differing kinematic motion characteristics and their manifestation are related to the perception of motion aesthetics and how this relates to the observer’s expertise is still investigated. It is hypothesized that different manifestations of the kinematic motion characteristics amplitude, fluency, and complexity are related to perceived motion aesthetics of dance skills and observer’s expertise. Dancers’ and non-dancers’ perception of motion aesthetics was assessed when watching stick-figure video sequences of semi-standardized dance jumps, classified relating to three kinematic motion characteristics and their semantic differentials. Large, fluent, and complex dance jumps were perceived as more aesthetic than small, jerky, and simple jumps. There was no general effect on the observer’s expertise. Nevertheless, non-dancers gave higher aesthetic ratings for complex dance jumps than dancers. Findings indicate that expertise does not relate to the perception of motion aesthetics per se. In contrast, specific kinematic motion characteristics of dance jumps do. Amplitude and fluency seem to be remarkable objective aesthetic qualities when perceiving motion aesthetics of dance skills. The observed dance skills’ complexity appears to be a critical parameter when addressing observers with different expertise. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biological motion perception; empirical aesthetics; likert-scale ratings; performing arts; stick-figure video sequences","","","","","","","","Berlyne D.E., Studies in the New Experimental Aesthetics, (1974); Brielmann A.A., Pelli D.G., Aesthetics, Current Biology, 28, 16, pp. 859-863, (2018); Bronner S., Shippen J., Biomechanical Metrics of Aesthetic Perception in Dance, Experimental Brain Research, 233, pp. 3565-3581, (2015); Burrows J., A Choreographer’s Handbook, (2010); Calvo-Merino B., Ehrenberg S., Haggard P., experts See It All: Configural Effects in Action Observation, Psychological Research, 74, 4, pp. 400-406, (2010); Calvo-Merino B., Glaser D.E., Grezes J., Passingham R.E., Haggard P., Action Observation and Acquired Motor Skills: An fMRI Study with Expert Dancers, Cerebral Cortex, 15, pp. 1243-1249, (2005); Calvo-Merino B., Jola C., Glaser D.E., Haggard P., Towards a Sensorimotor Aesthetics of Performing Art, Consciousness and Cognition, 17, pp. 911-922, (2008); Chatterjee A., Vartanian O., Neuroaesthetics, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 18, 7, pp. 370-375, (2014); Chi M.T.H., Two Approaches to the Study of Experts’ Characteristics, The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance, pp. 21-30, (2006); Christensen J.F., Calvo-Merino B., Dance as a Subject for Empirical Aesthetics, Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 7, 1, pp. 76-88, (2013); Christensen J.F., Nadal M., Cela-Conde C.M., Gomila A., A Norming Study and Library of 203 Dance Movements, Perception, 43, pp. 178-206, (2014); Cross E., Beautiful Embodiment: The Shaping of Aesthetic Preference by Personal Experience, Art, Aesthetics, and the Brain, pp. 189-208, (2015); Cross E., Kirsch L., Ticini L.F., Schutz-Bosbach S., The Impact of Aesthetic Evaluation and Physical Ability on Dance Perception, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 5, 102, pp. 1-10, (2011); Daprati E., Iosa M., Haggard P., A Dance to the Music of Time: Aesthetically-Relevant Chances in Body Posture in Performing Art, Plos One, 4, 3, pp. 1-11, (2009); Findlay L.C., Ste-Marie D.M., A Reputation Bias in Figure Skating Judging, Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 26, pp. 154-166, (2004); Gentile A.M., Skill Acquisition: Action, Movement, and Neuromotor Processes, Movement Science: Foundations for Physical Therapy, pp. 111-187, (2000); Gervasio A.H., Toward a Psychology of Responses to Dance Performance, Research in Dance Education, 13, 3, pp. 257-278, (2012); Graf L.K.M., Landwehr J.R., A Dual-Process Perspective on Fluency-Based Aesthetics: The Pleasure-Interest Model of Aesthetic Liking, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 19, 4, pp. 395-410, (2015); Gunes H., Schuller B., Automatic Analysis of Aesthetics: Human Beauty, Attractiveness and Likability, Social Signal Processing, pp. 183-201, (2017); Gur D., Rubin D.A., Kart B.H., Peterson A.M., Fuhrman C.R., Rockette H.E., King J.L., Forced Choice and Ordinal Discrete Rating Assessment of Image Quality: A Comparison, Journal of Digital Imaging, 10, 3, pp. 103-107, (1997); iPi Soft, Russia [Computer Software, (2008); Jacobsen T., Bridging the Arts and Sciences.

Prior to this time, relatively few publications addressed the identification and concerns of musicians' and dancers' medical problems. To determine what number and types of publications occurred prior to the actual beginnings of PAM as a discipline, and to determine how these original topics compared with present-day publications, a retrospective review of the current bibliographic database of the Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA) was undertaken. Out of a total of 12,600 entries to date, 489 references were found published from 1798 through 1974, which represent only 3.9% of the current database listings. One-sixth of the references were originally written in a language other than English. Journal articles were by far the most numerous type of publication. Topics with the highest number of entries included the neurobiology of music (n=77), dental/orofacial matters (71), and biographical accounts of composers or musicians and their illnesses (59). Other frequently published topics included hearing loss, physiology of playing instruments, and instrumental technique and teaching. Early topics with multiple publications included composers' biographies, dystonias, and surgery to improve finger independence for playing piano. Subjects whose publications occurred principally in the last two decades of this review included dermatological disorders, hearing loss, and ballet physiology, teaching, and technique. Those which remain popular to the present day include hearing loss, performance anxiety, focal dystonia, and dental/orofacial problems. © 2013 Science & Medicine.","","Bibliography of Medicine; Dancing; Drama; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Holistic Health; Humans; Music; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Injuries; Occupational Medicine; Societies, Medical; MLCS; MLOWN; article; bibliographic database; dystonic disorder; hearing impairment; history; human; medical literature; music; musician; performing arts; publication; teaching; dancing; literature; medical society; occupational accident; occupational disease; occupational medicine; philosophy; publication","","","","","","","Ramazzini B., Diseases of Workers, (1964); Harman S.E., Occupational diseases of instrumental musicians, a review, Maryland Med J, 31, 6, pp. 39-42, (1982); Performing Arts Medicine Association: PAMA Bibliography, (2012); Dawson W.J., The bibliography of performing arts medicine: A 5-year retrospective review, Med Probl Perform Art, 18, 1, pp. 27-32, (2003); Dawson W.J., The bibliography of performing arts medicine.

Additionally, as its feasibility as a new market for the distribution of performing arts has been confirmed, there have been various attempts to better enable audiences to experience performing arts in a metaverse. However, metaverse performing arts still require several improvements for active user participation and better enjoyment. It is also necessary to understand the barriers that people perceive in experiencing metaverse performing arts. Based on the construal level theory, this study explores and identifies the causal relationship in factors that influence viewing metaverse performing arts, such as the user's psychological distance, objective distance, subjective experience, and resistance. The results demonstrate that artistic distance is a significant factor that strongly affects resistance to viewing performances. Spatial, social, economic distance, and subject experience also impact resistance. The results also uncover the issues that must be discussed to vitalize metaverse-based performing arts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Metaverse; Performing arts; Psychological distance; Resistance; Subjective experience","Arts computing;

Yet touch delivered by care providers is a contentious and marginal practice, which is often avoided due to fears of abuse allegations, and the effects of touch avoidance can be significantly detrimental to the quality of care provided. The Safe Touch pilot project, developed with a London-based organization providing care to adults with learning disabilities, including those with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD), used performing arts practices and massage to help the staff develop and utilize ‘positive’ touch – touch for communication, interac-tion and well-being – when working with service users. Fifteen service users with learning disabilities and PMLD along with the organization’s staff participated in the project. Drawing on the project’s processes and findings, some successes and limitations in employing performing arts activities with care staff to increase the use of positive touch with people with PMLD were identified. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Major Article.

A Peking Opera singer usually exhibits a very strong personal style via introducing improvisation and expressiveness on stage which leads the actual rhythm and pitch contour to deviate significantly from the original music score. This inconsistency poses a great challenge in Peking Opera singing voice synthesis from a music score. In this work, we propose to deal with this issue and synthesize expressive Peking Opera singing from the music score based on the Duration Informed Attention Network (DurIAN) framework. To tackle the rhythm mismatch, Lagrange multiplier is used to find the optimal output phoneme duration sequence with the constraint of the given note duration from music score. As for the pitch contour mismatch, instead of directly inferring from music score, we adopt a pseudo music score generated from the real singing and feed it as input during training. The experiments demonstrate that with the proposed system we can synthesize Peking Opera singing voice with high-quality timbre, pitch and expressiveness. © 2020 International Speech Communication Association.

These individuals can be prone to a range of self-critical cognitions and behaviours which may make them susceptible to mental ill-health and psychological distress. Fostering and nurturing self-compassion is one approach to motivating behaviour and health which may be relevant within training and support settings. Self-compassion has been associated with a range of positive outcomes in the general community, as well as in those functioning in performance spaces, primarily sport. In this commentary, we outline why cultivation of self-compassion may be an increasingly valuable method for psychologists working with individuals from these environments, particularly within the context of a decimated industry during the global pandemic. We provide a brief overview of relevant research, before exploring practical and applied approaches (including transcripts) that can be used within therapeutic settings. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: Performers such as athletes, dancers, actors, and musicians are exposed to a range of stressors which can increase susceptibility to mental ill-health. Self-compassion can be cultivated in therapy and is associated with better mental health outcomes. Due to a range of hostile self-critical tendencies that are commonly seen in performers, some individuals may be resistant to concepts of self-compassion. What this topic adds: We outline a rationale for why psychologists working with performers should aim to nurture self-compassionate tendencies and practices. We outline methods and practical approaches to doing this in session, as well as describe potential hurdles and barriers for implementation. © 2022 Australian Psychological Society.","athletes; mental health;

This article builds a picture of how to design and conduct an integrative learning continuum which genuinely preserves the nature of mathematics. To draw conclusions, we combined datasets from mathematics teacher education and the lower secondary school context. We found out that suitable integrative phenomena can relate to concepts shared by each of the integrating disciplines, such as ratio; or they can be typical processes of knowledge acquisition and construction, such as sorting. The teaching experiments revealed that the integrative phenomena appropriate for use in school must enable a joint investigative learning experience. The third finding was that the pupils needed teacher support to view the subjects more broadly. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","integrative phenomena; Mathematics; visual arts","","","","","","","","Beane J.A., Curriculum integration and the disciplines of knowledge, Phi Delta Kappan., 76, pp. 616-622, (1995); Bresler L., The subservient, co-equal, affective, and social integration styles and their implications for the arts, Arts Educat.

Using the information obtained through qualitative strategies, -observation, interviews and focus groups-in which the protagonists of this experience -artists, teachers and students-have participated, the objectives of the case study are to identify the contextual conditions - legislative, social, cultural, formative - that determine the development of the artistic curriculum in formal education, analyze the participation of the professional artist in the training process and discover the previous ideas handled by the teaching staff to approach the artistic area. With this approach, the article relates an initiative that brings to light the shortcomings of the educational system in artistic matters, but also the desire of an educational community that puts all their efforts into achieving that Art Education is oriented towards social and cultural understanding of the world. © 2018 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

A literature review with an empirical application on the evaluation of the performance Aida at Teatro Alla Scala provides evidence about the type of indicators that can be derived from Twitter and support a discussion about potentialities and pitfalls connected to their adoption for the evaluation of performing arts. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Evaluation; measurement; performing arts; social media; Twitter","","","","","","","","Agostino D., Sidorova Y., A Performance Measurement System to Quantify the Contribution of Social Media: New Requirements for Metrics and Methods, Measuring Business Excellence, 20, 2, pp. 1-21, (2016); Al-Garadi M.A., Varathan K.D., Ravana S.D., Cybercrime Detection in Online Communications: The Experimental Case of Cyberbullying Detection in the Twitter Network, Computers in Human Behaviour, 63, pp. 433-443, (2016); Anbalagan B., Valliyammai C., #ChennaiFloods: Leveraging Human and Machine Learning for Crisis Mapping During Disasters Using Social Media, Paper presented at 2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on High Performance Computing Workshops (HiPCW), pp. 50-59, (2016); Arksey H., O'Malley L., Scoping Studies: Towards a Methodological Framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Arnaboldi M., Busco C., Cuganesan S., Accounting, Accountability, Social Media and Big Data: Revolution or Hype?, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 30, 4, pp. 762-766, (2017); Bakhshi H., Garcia J.M., Throsby D., Beyond Live: Digital Innovation in the Performing Arts, National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), (2010); Baumol W.J., Bowen W.G., On the Performing Arts: The Anatomy of Their Economic Problems, The Economics of the Arts, pp. 218-226, (1992); Bellucci M., Manetti G., Facebook as a Tool for Supporting Dialogic Accounting?

This paper examines the influence of differing lead and lag spectral contents on echo suppression threshold. The results indicate, that for a highpass filtered direct sound and a broadband reflection, attenuation of low frequencies initially results in an increase in echo suppression threshold, while for higher cutoff frequencies echo suppression threshold drastically decreases. For broadband direct sound and filtered reflections, the echo suppression threshold is inversely related to high frequency content. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.","","Acoustic Stimulation; Acoustics; Audiometry, Speech; Auditory Perception; Auditory Threshold; Facility Design and Construction; Female; Humans; Motion; Noise; Perceptual Masking; Pressure; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sound; Sound Localization; Sound Spectrography; Speech Perception; Time Factors; Vibration; Cutoff frequency; Broadband reflection; Dip effect; Frequency contents; Performing arts; Reflected sounds; Source directivity; Spectral content; Spectral overlap; acoustics; article; auditory stimulation; auditory threshold; construction work and architectural phenomena; female; hearing; human; motion; noise; perception; pressure; signal processing; sound; sound detection; speech audiometry; speech perception; time; vibration; Echo suppression","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (203636, 240453)","","Blauert J., Divenyi P.L., Spectral selectivity in binaural contralateral inhibition, Acustica, 66, pp. 267-274, (1988); Davies W.J., Cox T.J., Reducing seat dip attenuation, J.

Since a growing body of evidence shows that motion is one of the core components of emotion, and the representation of motion in art is often achieved by portraying unstable poses, we hypothesize that the visually more dynamic emotions are those with 'unstable' facial expressions, i.e., expressions that imply muscular tensions that cannot be held for long (e.g., rage, grief, amazement: E-motions) whereas static emotions are those which can last and even represent a constant facial feature in some people. To test this hypothesis we chose eleven static artworks from which we derived twelve human figures that convey different emotions in different proportions. Images were manipulated to produce two sets of stimuli: headless bodies (Set 1) and bodiless heads (Set 2). Participants were asked to rate perceived dynamicity of stimuli from Set 1 on a 7-point Likert scale (Session 1) and to rate each stimulus from Set 2 for joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger, fear, serenity, puzzlement and dynamicity (i.e., eight emotions and dynamicity). As expected, we found that some facial emotions (i.e., disgust, anger and fear) are positively related to the dynamicity attributed to the artworks: those emotions are the more sudden ones and thus the more 'unstable'. We also found that serenity is negatively related to dynamicity. Contrary to our expectations, we found instead that joy is statistically different from dynamicity, a result that calls for further investigation. © 2014 Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","dynamicity; Emotions; motion; visual arts","","","","","","","","Actis-Grosso R., Zavagno D., The representation of time course events in visual arts and the development of the concept of time in children: A preliminary study, Spat.

The Vintage Photograph Project combined passive and active arts engagement for an intervention that explored hospitalized children’s interest in and responses to restored vintage photographs. Methods: This descriptive study included a convenience sample of 20 hospitalized children, ages 5–18 in the United States. Drawing accompanied a one-time interview. Results: The photographs were of interest to all participants. Subject matter and feelings drove the child’s choice of favorite photograph. Responses to the photographs were incorporated within five themes: (1) exploring the unfamiliar, (2) seeking the familiar, (3) seeing something cute, (4) finding something funny and (5) liking what they saw. The act of drawing promoted conversation and social interaction; generated humor and stories of family, friends and pets; and resulted in artwork for an interesting hospital art exhibition. Conclusions: Findings suggest that restored vintage photographs are a subject of interest to hospitalized children and are worthy of consideration for comparison studies to determine their potential as positive distractors for hospitalized children. Study methods that incorporated vintage photographs provided an enjoyable and therapeutic intervention for children and their families. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","children's drawings;

It focuses in particular on contemporary and experimental music created between 1945 and the present day, an era in which conceptions of identity have changed alongside increasing innovation in musical composition as well as in the uses of abstraction, mixed media, and other novel techniques in the field of visual portraiture. In the absence of physical likeness, an element typical of portraiture that cannot be depicted in sound, composers have experimented with methods of constructing other attributes of identity in music, such as character, biography, and profession. By studying musical portraits of painters, authors, and modern celebrities, in addition to composers' self-portraits, the book considers how representational and interpretive processes overlap and differ between music and other art forms, as well as how music is used in the depiction of human identities. With focus on a range of musical portraits by composers including Peter Ablinger, Pierre Boulez, Morton Feldman, Philip Glass, György Ligeti, and Virgil Thomson, and through studies of director Robert Wilson's ongoing series of video portraits of modern-day celebrities and his ""portrait opera"" Einstein on the Beach, Musical Portraits offers to contribute to the study of music since 1945 through a detailed examination of contemporary understandings of music's capacity to depict identity, and of the intersections between music, literature, theater, film, and the visual arts. © Oxford University Press 2018.

It explores the challenges faced by lecturers developing curricula in the performing and creative arts and argues that the increasing focus on employability can conflict with universities' traditional aim of developing conceptual and critical thinkers. The article charges that the UK's higher education sector is rapidly transforming itself into a two-tier system, which is serving to dichotomize vocational and academic learning even further. It concludes with a call for universities, students and employers to reject the false dichotomy between vocational and academic learning and perceive education in a more holistic, longitudinal sense, which might in turn develop more balanced graduates who excel in networked knowledge, conceptual and theoretical imagination and critical, lateral thinking. © The Author(s) 2013.","creative arts; employability; higher education; performing arts; research-led teaching","","","","","","","","Barnett R., Realizing the University in An Age of Supercomplexity, (2000); Biggs J., Aligning Teaching and Assessment to Curriculum Objectives: Learning and Teaching Support Network, (2003); Biggs J.B., Tang C.S., Teaching for Quality Learning at University: What the Student Does, (2007); Bloom B.S., Taxonomy of Education Objectives.

The research is based on the Joconde database maintained by the French Ministry of Culture that contains illustrated artwork records from main French public and private museums representing archeological objects, decorative arts, fine arts, historical and scientific documents, etc. The Joconde database includes semantic metadata that describes properties of the artworks and their content. The developed methods create a data pipeline that processes metadata, trains a Convolutional Neural Network image classification model, makes prediction for the entire collection and expands the metadata to be the base for the SPARQL search queries. We developed a set of such queries to identify noise and silence in the human annotations and to search image content with results ranked according to the relevance of the objects quantified by the prediction score provided by the deep learning model. We also developed methods to discover new contextual relationships between the concepts in the metadata by analyzing the contrast between the concepts’ similarities in the Joconde’s semantic model and other vocabularies and we tried to improve the model prediction scores based on the semantic relations. Our results show that cross-fertilization between symbolic AI and machine learning can indeed provide the tools to address the challenges of the museum curators work describing the artwork pieces and searching for the relevant images. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","image recognition; knowledge graph; Machine learning; semantic Web","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Knowledge graph; Learning systems; Metadata; Semantic Web; Archaeological objects; Art collections; Content-based search; Decorative arts; Knowledge graphs; Machine-learning; Metadata quality; Semantic reasoning; Semantic-Web; Visual arts; Image recognition","","","","","European Union´s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (951911)","Funding text 1: This work is also partially supported by European Union´s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant number 951911 - AI4Media. ; Funding text 2: This work is also partially supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant number 951911 - AI4Media.","Russakovsky O., Deng J., Su H., Krause J., Satheesh S., Ma S., Huang Z., Karpathy A., Khosla A., Bernstein M., Et al., Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge, International Journal of Computer Vision, 115, 3, pp. 211-252, (2015); Lin T.-Y., Maire M., Belongie S., Hays J., Perona P., Ramanan D., Dollar P., Lawrence Zitnick C., MicrosoftCOCO: Common objects in context, European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740-755, (2014); Shen D., Wu G., Suk H.-I., Deep learning in medical image analysis, Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering, 19, pp. 221-248, (2017); Mednikov Y., Nehemia S., Zheng B., Benzaquen O., Lederman D., Transfer representation learning using Inception-V3 for the detection of masses in mammography, 2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 2587-2590, (2018); Rodriguez C.S., Lech M., Pirogova E., Classification of style in fine-art paintings using transfer learning and weighted image patches, 2018 12th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS), pp. 1-7, (2018); Sandoval C., Pirogova E., Lech M., Two-stage deep learning approach to the classification of fine-art paintings, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 41770-41781, (2019); Karayev S., Trentacoste M., Han H., Agarwala A., Darrell T., Hertzmann A., Winnemoeller H., Recognizing image style, Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference, (2014); Lecoutre A., Negrevergne B., Yger F., Recognizing art style automatically in painting with deep learning, Asian Conference on Machine Learning., pp. 327-342, (2017); Cetinic E., Lipic T., Grgic S., Fine-tuning convolutional neural networks for fine art classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 114, pp. 107-118, (2018); Seguin B., Striolo C., Kaplan F., Visual link retrieval in a database of paintings, European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 753-767, (2016); Boutell M.R., Luo J., Shen X., Brown C.M., Learning multi-label scene classification, Pattern Recognition, 37, 9, pp. 1757-1771, (2004); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition, International Conference on Learning Representations, (2015); Szegedy C., Vanhoucke V., Ioffe S., Shlens J., Wojna Z., Rethinking the inception architecture for computer vision, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2818-2826, (2016); Berners-Lee T., Hendler J., Lassila O., The semantic web, Scientific American, 284, 5, pp. 34-43, (2001); Garnier F., Thesaurus iconographique, Système Descriptif des Représentations, (1984); Manoeuvre L., Numérique et nouveaux enjeux pour le patrimoine, La Lettre de l’OCIM.

Sociological accounts are, despite the rise of cultural and art sociology in recent years, almost complete absent from this discussion. This paper makes a contribution to the globalisation of the arts, but from a sociological and quantitative perspective. The focus of this paper is on particular type of global institution - biennials and other types of art festivals or large-scale exhibitions. These institutions are seen being major places of exchange and formulation of norms and standards. They define what is hip and new. However, theories of globalisation, in combination with accounts from professionals of the field, claim that these institutions propagate only Western values or have a homogenising quality, because they only show caste works from artists of the Western hemisphere or that they repeat the same works and artists across the globe. However, based on a large-scale quantitative survey, this paper will demonstrate that picture is more complex and that we find tendencies to homogenisation and heterogenisation existing at the same time or that the locality of these events acts as a source of uniqueness and innovativeness. The paper proposes a new theoretical framework that interprets these findings as based on Niklas Luhmann's idea of second-order observation and Bruno Latour's and Harrison C. White's conception of the network. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","art history; diversity and (in)equality; festivals; fine art; global art world; hegemony; music; performing arts","","","","","","","","Albertsen N., Diken B., Artworks' Networks: Field, System or Mediators?, Theory, Culture & Society, 21, 3, pp. 35-32, (2004); Alexander V.D., Bowler A.E., Art at the Crossroads: The Arts in Society and the Sociology of Art, Poetics, 43, 1, pp. 1-19, (2014); Altshuler B., Salon to Biennial: Exhibitions that Made Art History Volume 1: 1863-1959, (2008); Anand N., Brittany J.C., Tournament Rituals, Category Dynamics, and Field Configuration: The Case of the Booker Prize, Journal of Management Studies, 45, 6, pp. 1036-1060, (2008); Anand N., Watson M.R., Tournament Rituals in the Evolution of Fields: The Case of the Grammy Awards, Academy of Management Journal, 47, 1, pp. 59-80, (2004); Appadurai A., Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy, Public Culture, 2, 2, pp. 1-24, (1990); Ardenne P., The Mind: Interview with Lise Guéhenneux, Crash, 163, DECEMBER, pp. 160-162, (2012); Banks M., Craft Labour and Creative Industries, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 16, 3, pp. 305-322, (2010); Bauer U.M., Hanru H., Shifting Gravity: World Biennial Forum N°1, (2013); Becker H.S., Art Worlds, (1982); Beckert J., Rossel J., The Price of Art: Uncertainty and Reputation in the Art Field, European Societies, 15, 2, pp. 178-195, (2013); Belting H., Birken J., Buddensieg A., Global Studies: Mapping Contemporary Art and Culture, (2011); Belting H., Buddensieg A., The Global Art World: Audiences, Markets, and Museums, (2009); Belting H., Weibel P., Buddensieg A., Contemporary Art and the Museum: A Global Perspective, (2007); Block R., The Song of the Earth: Biennials in Dialogue, (2000); Bonnet E., Biennales D'Art Contemporain: Œuvre & Frontières, (2016); Buchholz L., Wuggenig U., Cultural Globalization Between Myth and Reality: The Case of the Contemporary Visual Arts, (2005); Buergel R.M., Glasmeier M., Stengel K., pp. 173-180; Bydler C., The Global Art World, Inc.: On the Globalization of Contemporary Art, (2004); Byrne J., Contemporary Art and Globalisation: Biennials and the Emergence of the De-Centred Artist, International Journal of the Humanities, 3, 1, pp. 169-172, (2005); Clark J., Desai V.N., Histories of the Asian 'New': Biennales and Contemporary Asian Art Williamstown; MA Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Asian Art History in the Twenty-First Century, pp. 229-249, (2007); Crane D., The Transformation of the Avant-Garde. the New York Art World, 1940-1985, (1987); De La Fuente E., The 'New Sociology of Art': Putting Art Back into Social Science Approaches to the Arts, Cultural Sociology, 1, 3, pp. 409-425, (2007); Delacour H., Leca B., Moeran B., Pedersen J.S., pp. 36-58; Demos T.J., Elkins J., Valiavicharska Z., Kim A., pp. 209-213; Dundjerovic A., Bateman I.N., Robert Lepage Inc. - Theatre for Festival Audiences, Contemporary Theatre Review, 19, 4, pp. 413-427, (2009); Efland A.D., A History of Art Education.

It examines policies for and ideas about the support, management and safeguarding of the performing arts, first through the colonial lens of historical preservation, then through intangible cultural heritage and finally from recent theorising in music ecology. In presenting an overview of cultural heritage policy in the FSM with regard to the performing arts, this paper discusses the relationship between heritage practices and colonialism, and it reviews the place of music and dance in the cultural management of Micronesia. Drawing on recent work in ethnomusicology, the article argues for considerations of the holistic space of the performing arts and the facilitation of participatory practices to address concerns of cultural demise and to reframe approaches to music and dance as cultural heritage in the Pacific. © 2014 © 2014 Brian Diettrich.","intangible heritage; Micronesia; music; Pacific Islands; performing arts; preservation","","","","","","Victoria University of Wellington; Wenner-Gren Foundation, (7409)","","Allen A.S., Dawe K., Current Directions in Ecomusicology: Music, Nature, Environment, (2015); Berg M.L., The wandering life among unreliable islanders': The hamburg sudsee-expedition in micronesia, The Journal of Pacific History, 23, 1, pp. 95-101, (1988); Brandellero A., Janssen S., Cohen S., Roberts L., Popular music heritage, cultural memory and cultural identity, International Journal of Heritage Studies, 20, 3, pp. 219-223, (2014); Byrne D., Western hegemony in archaeological heritage management, History and Anthropology, 5, pp. 269-276, (1991); Diettrich B., Moulin J., Webb M., Music in Pacific Island Cultures: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture, (2011); New national holiday for culture and traditions in fsm, Press Release 0310-38, (2010); Survey of Federated States of Micronesia Migrants in the United States Including Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island (CNMI), (2012); A Resolution to Ratify the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Convention, (2012); Micronesia Culture and Traditions Day, (2010); Grant C., Rethinking safeguarding: Objections and responses to protecting and promoting endangered musical heritage, Ethnomusicology Forum, 21, 1, pp. 31-51, (2012); Grant C., Music Endangerment, (2014); Haglelgam J.R., Federated states of micronesia, The Contemporary Pacific, 22, 1, pp. 126-130, (2010); Hanlon D., Nan madol on pohnpei, Made in Oceania: Social Movements, Cultural Heritage and the State in the Pacific, pp. 121-140, (2011); Hezel F.X., Loss of culture: How real is the threat?, Micronesian Counselor, 56, pp. 2-14, (2005); Howard K., Music As Intangible Cultural Heritage: Policy, Ideology, and Practice in the Preservation of East Asian Tradition, (2012); Jaynes B., Fire in Chuuk, (2011); John T., Historic preservation and development in the federated states of micronesia: An overview, Pacific History: Papers from the 8th Pacific History Association Conference, pp. 455-459, (1992); Keogh B., On the limitations of music ecology, Journal of Music Research Online, 4, pp. 1-10, (2013); Kim M.M., Into the Deep: Launching Culture and Policy in the Federated States of Micronesia, (2011); King T.F., How micronesia changed the U.S. Historic preservation program and the importance of keeping it from changing back, Micronesian Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences, 5, 1-2, pp. 505-516, (2006); Kirshenblatt-Gimblett B., Theorizing heritage, Ethnomusicology, 39, 3, pp. 367-380, (1995); Kirshenblatt-Gimblett B., Intangible heritage as metacultural production, Museum International, 56, 1-2, pp. 52-65, (2004); Kiste R.C., Marshall M., American anthropology in micronesia, 1941-1997, Pacific Science, 54, 3, pp. 265-274, (2000); Labadi S., Representations of the nation and cultural diversity in discourses on world heritage, Journal of Social Archaeology, 7, 2, pp. 147-170, (2007); Lixinski L., Selecting heritage: The interplay of art, politics and identity, European Journal of International Law, 22, 1, pp. 81-100, (2011); Marett A., Vanishing songs: How musical extinctions threaten the planet, Ethnomusicology Forum, 19, 2, pp. 249-262, (2010); Metzgar E., Carolinian voyaging in the new millennium, Micronesian Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences, 5, 1-2, pp. 293-305, (2006); Nason J., Peter J., Keeping rong from wrong: The identification and protection of traditional intellectual property in chuuk, federated states of micronesia, International Journal of Cultural Property, 16, pp. 273-290, (2009); O'Neill Jon G., Spennemann R.D.H., A review of historic preservation funding in micronesia 1986-2003, Micronesian Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences, 5, 1-2, pp. 580-591, (2006); Pigliasco G.C., We branded ourselves long ago: Intangible cultural property and commodification of fijian firewalking, Oceania, 80, 2, pp. 161-181, (2010); Pigliasco G.C., Are the grassroots growing?

We also describe how these exchanges about the features of the sequencer leaded the software development.","","Digital storage; Software design; Intermedia; Musical score; Performing arts; Computer music","","","","","","","Allombert A., Aspects Temporels D'un Système de Partitions Musicales Interactives Pour la Composition et L'interprétation, (2009); Allombert A., Assayag G., Dessainte-Catherine M., Rueda C., Concurrent constraints models for interactive scores, Pr. of the 3rd Sound and Music Computing Conference (2006), (2006); Balaban M., Murray N., Interleaving time and structure, Computers and Artificial Intelligence, 17, 1, pp. 1-34, (1998); Baltazar P., Gagnere G., Outils et pratique du sonore dans le spectacle vivant, Actes des Journées D'Informatiques Musicales (JIM07), pp. 153-162, (2007); Camurri A., Catorcini A., Innocenti C., Massari A., Music and multimedia knowledge and reasoning: The harp system, Computer Music Journal, 19, 2, pp. 34-58, (1995); Camurri A., Haus G., Zaccaria R., Describing and performing musical processes by means of petri nets, Interface, 15, pp. 1-23, (1986); Coduys T., Ferry G., Iannix - Aesthetical/symbolic visualisations for hypermedia composition, Proc. of the 1st Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC04), (2004); Senac R.W.P., De Saqui Sannes P., Hierarchical time stream petri nets : A model for hypermedia systems, Proc. of the 16th International Conference on Applications and Theory on Petri Nets, pp. 451-470, (1995); Pope S., Music notations and the representation of musical structure and knowledge, Perspectives of New Music, 24, 2, (1986)","","","International Computer Music Association","","International Computer Music Conference, ICMC 2010","1 June 2010 through 5 June 2010","New York City and Stony Brook","110975","","0971319286","","","English","Int.

Using distance technology, live music, dance, movement, visual arts and commentary, the work creates a rich counterpoint of media linking great distances. Auksalaq integrates artistic expression, scientific information and social/political commentary to present an interactive, multi-dimensional experience that embodies relevant complex cultural and empirical processes. The piece illuminates scientific analysis as well as cultural and political issues surrounding global climate change. Creating the score, libretto, media content and IT software customizations for Auksalaq has been a sustained effort by two co-creators. After conceiving the project and overall structure of the work together, one collaborator penned the music and libretto and the other created the media content and IT production design. © 2011 ICMC.

It analyses the similarities and diffferences with earlier genres with an explicit participatory agenda, including certain forms of LEKRA literature and art of the 1950s and 1960s, 'people's theatre' since the 1970s, and 'conscientization art' since the 1980s. One of the main challenges for contemporary community media has been to reconcile class diffferences in the collaboration between media or art facilitators and local communities. These and other factors have afffected the accessibility, distribution, sustainability and reach of their ideas, activities and outputs. The article demonstrates how facilitators and practitioners have tried to solve some of these problems through the exploration of alternative media networks, formats and content. © 2013 Freek Colombijn.","Central Java;

This does not deny the deep import that Dewey ascribed to aesthetic experience (both in art and in life) but it does suggest that we might use his theory of ethical practice in conjunction with his theory of art as experience in order to create a more robust and unified Deweyan theory of what the performing artist does. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","aesthetics; dramatic rehearsal; ethics; John Dewey; moral imagination; performing arts; pragmatism","","","","","","","","Alexander T.M., John Dewey and the Moral Imagination: Beyond Putnam and Rorty toward a Postmodern Ethics, Transactions of the Charles S.

Architectural indices such as room shape, seating capacity, room volume, balcony configuration, and the like as well as acoustical indices such as RT, EDT, G, C80, IACC, and the like for the halls found in the literature are chronologically tabulated and statistically analyzed to identify trends and relationships in architectural and acoustical design for each of the historical periods identified.

We conducted a pilot photo-story intervention with gay-identified men with HIV in the Midwest USA to help men express and manage HIV stigma; and assess the feasibility of arts-based interventions. Methods: Eight men took pictures, participated in three group and one individual discussion session, and planned and attended two public photograph exhibits. Theme and narrative analysis identified key stigma and feasibility themes in qualitative textual and visual data. Results: Men's images and discussions focused on three aspects of HIV stigma: (1) ignorance, (2) difficult disclosures and (3) isolation. Photo-stories facilitated men's ability to manage stigma by promoting (1) self-discovery and (2) social support. Conclusions: Participants' stigma experiences were significant. Stigma intervention solutions are needed at individual, relational, community and social levels. Art-based interventions such as photo-stories are promising strategies to identify and address stigma at all levels. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","HIV/AIDS; public health; qualitative data analysis; visual arts","","","","","","","","Bouris A., Guilamo-Ramos V., Pickard A., Shiu C., Loosier P.S., Dittus P., Michael Waldmiller J., A systematic review of parental influences on the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth: Time for a new public health research and practice agenda, Journal of Primary Prevention, 31, pp. 273-309, (2010);

Thus, the framework is embedded in the specific artistic and institutional contexts it aims to represent, reflecting the real-life complexities of intertwined management and artistic practices. Using resource and competence thinking to analyze artistic processes in the performing arts, the framework captures how resources are deployed, developed and ultimately transformed to create and sustain artistic achievement. The concept entangles aspects of evaluation and strategic development, offering an alternative to mainstream management and evaluation approaches to arts management research that, by putting artistic work at the center of the inquiry, is informed by insights from the field. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arts management; competences; evaluation; performing arts; resources; strategic development","","","","","","","","Abfalter D., Das Unmessbare messen?

We disaggregated attendance by type (discounted vs. single tickets) and by location. Our results suggest that the preferences of single and discounted ticket buyers are different. Specifically, we found that for discounted ticket holders, live theatre is negatively affected by price, but that for single ticket holders, the consumption of live theatre displays properties of the Veblen effect. We speculate whether this could be evidence of the Veblen effect for the consumption of the arts in general and for consumption of state financed live theatre for the Turkish case. © SAGE Publications.","discounted tickets;

I show how the critical and geographical trope of the South - understood as a mode of location and an epistemic category - not only offers a framework for understanding the constellation of differences and multiplicity that inflect the category of the contemporary in Australian art, it also enables one to rethink the spatial and temporal assumptions that underlie the history of this art. This is particularly evident when one considers the ways in which the work and presence of various Asian artists in Australia have opened up new horizons of possibility for rethinking the spatial and temporal coordinates of Australian art, culture and identity. © 2008 International Australian Studies Association.","Asian australian; Asian diaspora; Australian art; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Smith T., Contemporary Art and Contemporaneity, pp. 681-707, (2006); Choy L.W., The distance between us/Comparative contemporaries/ criticism as symptom, Knowledge Dialogue Exchange: Remapping Cultural Globalisms From the South, pp. 51-65, (2005); Fabian J., Time and The Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object, (1983); Bal M., Quoting Caravaggio: Contemporary Art, Preposterous History, (1999); Benjamin W., Illuminations, (1968); Smith T., The Provincialism Problem, Art Forum, 13, 1, pp. 54-59, (1974); Chakrabarty D., Provincialising Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference, (2000); Gibson R., South of the West: Postcolonialism and The Narrative Construction of Australia, (1992); Papastergiadis N., South-south-south: An introduction, Complex Entanglements: Art, Globalisation and Cultural Difference, (2003); Clark J., Australian Art and Asia: Then And Now, (1992); Ang I., Stratton J., Asianising Australia: Notes toward a critical transnationalism in Cultural Studies, Cultural Studies, 10, 1, (1996); Smith B., Introduction: A bibliographical memoir, The Writings of Bernard Smith: Bibliography 1938-1998, (2000); Mosquera G., Alien-own/own alien: Notes on globalisation and cultural difference, Complex Entanglements, pp. 20-21; Murray K., Keys to the South, Australian Humanities Review, 44, (2008); Papastergiadis, South-south-south; Papastergiadis, South-south-south; Papastergiadis, South-south-south, pp. 1-15; Papastergiadis, South-south-south; Rogoff I., Infirma T., Geography's Visual Culture, pp. 4-7, (2000); Yue A., Asian-Australian cinema, Asian Australian modernity, Diaspora: Negotiating Asian Australia, (2000); Bennett J., Empathic Vision, (2005); Derrida J., Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and The New International, (1994); Butler R., Three signs of the contemporary, Broadsheet: Contemporary Visual Arts and Cultur, 34, 2, (2005); Butler, Three Signs of the Contemporary; Butler R., The curse of the contemporary, Interesting Times: Focus On Contemporary Australian Art, Exhibition Catalogue, Museum of Contemporary Art, (2005); Butler, The Curse of the Contemporary; Perera S., Futures imperfect, Alter/Asians: Asian-Australian Identities In Art, Media and Popular Culture, (2000); Massey D., For Space, (2005); Kapur G., The centre-periphery model or how are we placed?: Contemporary cultural practice in India, Third Text, pp. 16-17, (1991)","","","Routledge","","","","","","14443058","","","","English","J.

After the outbreak of the Civil War, they both went into exile in Argentina and worked for Margarita Xirgu, participated in the Bienales Hispanoamericanas de Arte and exhibited their works at the Galerie Silvagni in Paris. In Argentina, they both actively lived and worked throughout more than two decades before returning to Madrid. Nevertheless, although Mallo was recuperated by the Movida madrileña as a mythicized icon of the prewar culture, Durán continued working in the background. This paper is focused on the analysis of the common points in their educational and professional trajectories. Moreover, it seeks to explain why both artists never worked together and barely mentioned each other in their respective writings. © 2019 Universidad de Granada.

This paper explores this issue by first providing a literature review which compares the social experience of live performing arts to new forms of live online entertainment. The implementation of a proof-of-concept system for live streaming performing arts into a social virtual environment is then introduced. This paper concludes that social virtual environments have the potential to provide a greater degree of social awareness within a virtual audience. However, these environments still struggle to transmit the full extent of a live experience due to current limitations in the technology.

The students mapped memories and experiences of their first teaching experience from practicum, motivated by discussion, stimuli and feedback. The mapping process had several loops where the students worked collectively to map their visual reflections onto large-scale canvases. These performance paintings became palimpsests, portraying layers of collaborative practice and learning. The networks of interactions, dialogue, relationships and group dynamics were exposed in the material practice of the participants. As an a/r/tographical rendering, the process simultaneously documented the group's subjective expressions as well as their emergent teacher identities. The collaborative model was at once both powerful and provocative as the dynamics of collective art-making evolved into reflections of developing pedagogy.

Semi-structured interviews (n = 10) were conducted with students enrolled in a higher education institution in Australia. Results indicated that intending dancers take several factors into consideration when contemplating a professional dance career: natural progression of skill, employment opportunities, location, and peer recommendation. In addition, intending dancers have several perceived institutional obligations: skill development, quality of teachers and training, and networking opportunities. The current article adds novel insights to dance education literature by considering the trainee-institution relationship through the psychological contract lens. It is anticipated that the findings will assist future research that seeks to incorporate student perceptions into dance curriculum development. © The Author(s) 2013.","dance; higher education; performing arts;

The paper performs a close reading of a single archival document, the program of the Ensemble’s début performance before non-European socialist audiences that took place in Shenyang on September 21, 1956. The repertoire featured a simple chronological, quasi-historical overview of musical and dance traditions from Hungary. It offered a vague, highly stylized set of references to Hungary’s military traditions. It attempted to realize the triple formula of a new, ‘modern, Magyar, European,’ art form, and foregrounded a plebian (‘peasant-‘) progressive-patriotic theme with hints of ethnic nationalism. The program provided the absolute minimum of the standard Stalinist fare, resolutely avoided any reference to the USSR or Russia, and, most fascinating, closed with a self-ironical dance piece featuring a powerful allegorical story of socialism with a ‘Hungarian face,’ something that represented a resolute break with the Stalinist aesthetic canon and reinforced the group’s political commitment to a socialism that is ‘modern, Magyar and European.’. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Close reading; Europe; Hungary; Modernity; Performing arts; Repertoire; Stalinism","","","","","","","","Military History Archive, Budapest, pp. 272-277; Szegedy-Maszak M., Magyar művelődéstörténet (Budapest: Osiris, 1998), pp. 439-441; Kovacs E., A nemzet einstandolása?

The principle of entropy, which C. P. Snow claimed could serve as a litmus test of the ‘two cultures’ divide, provides an excellent starting point for exploring how artists have employed scientific concepts far beyond their original contexts. As a case study in interdisciplinarity, the use of entropy in the visual arts is also a lens to consider the evolution of an artistic proposal from the 1960s known as ‘system aesthetics’.

For the first time we sought to compare the MSS prevalence and profile (e.g. MSS location, impact) of adult amateur musicians with those of non-musicians. Amateur and non-musicians were asked to complete a questionnaire that collected data on their demographics, musical activities and MSS outcomes. A total of 456 participants were included, 30.9% of whom were amateur musicians. MSSs were common for both amateurs and non-musicians (96.4% and 96.1%, respectively, for the last twelve months). The only significant difference between the two groups was for the twelve-month prevalence of head MSSs with amateur musicians having a higher prevalence than non-musicians (49.6% and 39.8%, respectively, p<0.05). We conclude that amateur musicians do not have a substantially different MSS prevalence and profile compared with non-musicians for this university-based population. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.

However, relatively little has been written about visual arts representing the armed struggle. This paper aims to explore the visual arts created around the armed struggle; and begin to position this within a broader understanding of the culture dynamics that emerged as part of Southern Africa’s liberation movements, and the armed struggle in particular. Most scholars agree that music, poetry and dance were integral cultural expressions within the liberation movements; styles often developed within military camps, then were adopted throughout ‘liberated zones’. In contrast, military structures provided little or no space to practice the visual arts. Active military personal had little time or resources to create visual artworks, no storage and exhibition space, and little access to reproduction or distribution. Visual representation of fighters – both in photographs and realistic portraits – could create a security risk if taken by the enemy. Unlike music and writing, most visual art of the armed struggle was therefore produced within the mass movements, and in solidarity movements supporting the armed struggle. This paper discusses direct (in some cases personal) experiences of problems confronting visual artists of the armed struggle; and solutions artists found for these. It places the failure to recognize the visual art of the armed struggle within a broader failure to explore the integration of armed resistance with cultural practice and belief in the struggle for democratic societies in Southern Africa. © 2018 Southern African Historical Society.","Armed struggle; Culture of liberation; National liberation; South Africa; Thami Mnyele; Umkhonto we Sizwe; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Toure S., Second Congress of Black Writers and Artists, (2014); Gilbert S., Singing against Apartheid: ANC Cultural Groups and the International Anti- Apartheid Struggle, Journal of Southern African Studies, 33, 2, pp. 421-441, (2007); Maaba B., Ramdhani N., Visual Artists in the Struggle against Apartheid, South Africa Democracy Education Trust, 4, pp. 1980-1990, (2010); Seidman J., Red on Black: The Story of The South African Poster Movement, (2007); Seidman G., Guerrillas in Their Midst: Armed Struggle in the South African Anti-Apartheid Movement’, Mobilization: An International Quarterly, 6, 2, pp. 111-127, (2001); Kellner C., Gonzalez S., Thami Mnyele + Meduart Ensemble Retrospective, (2009); Machel S., Culture, Words Unchained, Language and Revolution in Grenada, (1974); Thiong'O N.W., African Identities: Pan-Africanism in the Era of Globalization and Capitalist Fundamentalism, Macalester International, 14, (2004); Geiss I., The Pan-African Movement: A History of Pan Africanism in America, Europe and Africa, Transann Keep, (1974); Shepperson G., Drake S.C., The Fifth Pan-African Conference, 1945 and the All African Peoples Congress, 1958, Contributions in Black Studies, 8, (2008); Kellner And Gonzalez, Thami Mnyele + MEDU; Sitas A., Description of a Struggle: South African Theatre since 1970’, World Literature Today, 70, 1, pp. 83-87, (1996); Solberg R., Alternative Theatre in South Africa, (1999); Saeboe M., A State of Exile: The ANC and Umkhonto We Sizwe in Angola, 1976–1989, (2002); Ansell G., Soweto Blues: Jazz, Politics and Popular Music in South Africa, (2004); Israel P., Step with the Times: Mapiko Masquerades of Mozambique; Wa Thiongo N., Decolonising The Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature (London: J.

Participation in the arts may contribute to positive mental health through the mechanism of flow, a mental state of becoming completely engrossed in an enjoyable activity. Participation in performing arts specifically may be especially predictive of positive mental health due to its collective nature. Objective and methods: This study uses the Population Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Transition to Adulthood Sample (N = 5657 person-years) to investigate whether participation in performing arts predicts positive mental health in young adults in the US through adjusted least squares and individual-level fixed-effects linear regression models across three waves of data per individual. Additionally, the study investigates different levels of participation to establish a dose response and employs stratified analyses by race/ethnicity, income, and gender. Results: Results show that, compared to no participation, participating in the performing arts every day is associated with an increase in positive mental health of a 0.315 effect size [p < 0.001]. White and higher income individuals are more likely to participate in the arts than people of color and lower income individuals. Yet, the association between performing arts and positive mental health is similar, if not greater, for people of color than it is for white individuals. Conclusion: This study shows strong associations between frequent performing arts participation and positive mental health and suggests that more resources should be allocated to performing arts access for young adults from diverse backgrounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Arts participation; Flourishing; Mental wellbeing; Performing arts; Positive mental health; Racial/ethnic equity; Secondary data analysis; Young adults","Adult; Humans; Income; Mental Health; Young Adult; United States; adult; art; equity; ethnicity; least squares method; mental health; race; regression analysis; young population; adult; adulthood; article; controlled study; data analysis; dose response; effect size; ethnicity; female; gender; human; human experiment; human tissue; least square analysis; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; performing arts; population research; psychological well-being; race; young adult; income; mental health","","","","","","","Angrist J.D., Pischke J.-S., Mostly Harmless Econometrics: an Empiricist's Companion, (2008); Baker K.C., Mazza N., The healing power of writing: applying the expressive/creative component of poetry therapy, J.

We introduce Multisensory Integrated Expressive Environments (MIEEs) as a framework for Mixed Reality applications in the performing arts. Paradigmatic contexts for applications of MIEEs are multimedia concerts, interactive dance/music/video installations, interactive museum exhibitions, distributed cooperative environments for theatre and artistic expression. MIEEs are user-centred systems able to interpret the high-level information conveyed by performers through their expressive gestures and to establish an effective multisensory experience taking into account expressive, emotional, affective content. The lecture discusses some main issues for MIEEs and presents the EyesWeb (www.eyesweb.org) open software platform which has been recently redesigned (version 4) in order to better address MIEE requirements.

We sought to develop and evaluate a prototype “tool” to help prepare children for having their  blood taken, a procedure most feared by children. Methods: A user-experience design, using creative arts was utilized. Twenty-three children aged 4–12 with haematological conditions participated. Phase 1 involved children developing a blood preparatory “tool” alongside an illustrator. Phase 2 involved children trialing a paper prototype of the “tool”, in the form of Blood Quest, a game designed to take children on a journey around the body learning about the blood as they go. Results:. Half of all children said they felt better about having their blood taken after playing the game and half reported feeling the same. Most children found the game fun and informative,. Conclusions: This small-scale pilot evaluation suggests that with further refinement, the game has the potential for young children to feel more informed and less frightened about having their blood taken. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","digital media;

To understand the factors that cause rural–urban differentials in student performance in different SHSs in Ghana, we adopted a qualitative–quantitative research approach with interview, observation, and questionnaire administration to examine teaching and learning of Visual Arts in six public SHSs: two each in rural, peri-urban, and urban settings in metropolitan Kumasi. Findings from data sourced from 120 students (66 males; 54 females), 17 teachers (15 males; two females), and 24 Visual Arts lessons revealed that unlike Visual Arts education in urban SHSs, student achievement in rural and peri-urban schools is hampered by lowered criteria for admitting students into Visual Arts, large class sizes, lack of studio facilities, insufficient specialist teachers, and instructional time for teaching elective Visual Arts subjects, adoption of ineffective teaching strategies, setting of low academic standards, and inadequate funding for teaching practical lessons. Unlike rural and peri-urban SHSs, urban schools organize speech and prize-giving days to motivate students, and effectively collaborate with Visual Arts students to mount art exhibitions to showcase their creativity. Improving the quality and distribution of social infrastructure, educational facilities, and qualified teachers, and actively monitoring educational standards in rural and peri-urban SHSs could raise academic achievement for students in all parts of Ghana. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Ghana;

Aristotle's concept of tragedy has been perceived as both a descriptive and a normative concept: a description of a practice as it should be continued. This biased reading of ancient theory is not exceptional, but in the case of Aristotle's Poetics, a particular question can be raised. Aristotle has written about tragedy, at a moment that tragedy had no meaningful political or civic function anymore. As political theory - e.g. as developed in the Politics and the Art of Rhetoric - should contain the risks of transgression in political practice, so poetic theory can contain the risks of the representation of transgressions in poetic practices such as the performance of tragedy. Apart from an account on Aristotle's Poetics as a integral part of his ethical and political theory, this article argues the (mis)readings of Aristotelian dramatic theory since the Renaissance, and especially in 17th century France are not coincidental. Aristotle's theory itself fits neatly into a political-theoretical framework or, if one puts it more brutally, an ideology. The particular theatricality of French absolutism took clearly its advantage from this ideological (mis)readings of Aristotle. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","17th century philosophy; Aesthetics; Aristotle; Cultural studies; French tragedy; Greek tragedy; Performing arts; Pierre Corneille; Theatre theory","17th century philosophy; Aesthetics; Aristotle; Cultural studies; French tragedy; Greek tragedy; Performing arts; Pierre Corneille; Theatre theory; Social sciences","","","","","","","Apostolides J.-M., Le Roi-machine.

Schnapp. Shuttling back and forth between literature, architecture, design, and the visual arts, the volume explores the metaphysics of speed, futurist and dada typography, real and imaginary forms of architecture, shifting regimes of mass spectacle, the iconography of labour, exhibitions as modes of public mobilization and persuasion, and the emergence of industrial models of literary culture and communication. The figures featured in the book include Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Mario Morasso, Julius Evola, Piero Portaluppi, Giuseppe Terragni, Alessandro Blasetti, Massimo Bontempelli, Giorgio de Chirico, Bruno Munari, Curzio Malaparte, and Henry Furst. Alongside these human protagonists appear granite blocks that drive the design of modern monuments, military searchlights that animate civilian shows, worker armies viewed as machines, sunglasses that tiptoe along the boundary of the private and public, newsreels as twentieth-century interpretations of Trajan's column, and book covers and bindings that act as authorial self-portraits.

We start by arguing that dominant traditions in higher education reproduced the mind-body dualism that shaped the social matrix of meanings on knowledge transmission. We highlight the limits of the modern disembodied and decontextualized reason and suggest that, considering the students’ and teachers’ bodies as non-relevant aspects, or even obstacles, leads to the invisibilization of fundamental aspects involved in teaching and learning processes. We thus conducted a study, from a socio-cultural perspective, in which we analyse the emerging matrix of meanings given to the body and bodily engagement by students, through a systematic qualitative analysis of 47 personal diaries. We structured the results and the discussion around five interpretative axes: (1) the production of diaries enables historicization, while the richness of bodily experience expands the boundaries of diaries into non-textual modalities; (2) curricular context modulates the emergent meanings of the body; (3) physical and symbolic spaces guide the matrix of bodily meanings; (4) the bodily dimension of the courses facilitates the emergence of an emotional dimension to get in touch with others and to register one's own emotional experiences; and (5) the body functions as a condition for biographical continuity. These axes are discussed under the light of the general process of consciousness-raising and resignification of the situated body in the educational practice. © 2021, The Author(s).","Body; Diaries; Embodied learning; Higher education; Performing arts","","","","","","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL; Faculté des Sciences de la Vie, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, SV; Université de Neuchâtel, UniNE","","Abbagnano N., Visalberghi A., Historia de la pedagogía, (2015); Abbey E., .

The research analyzes this phenomenon of visual culture caused by technological innovations and scientific advances, ideological currents of thought, and the influence particular to the cultural and philosophical heritage of the past. The methodology of this theoretical research is based on the interdisciplinary approach of visual studies. Knowledge or comprehension of the visual progresses from hermeneutics to critical theory, in search of understanding through interdisciplinarity (which includes traditional disciplines such as art theory, history of art and aesthetics). Among the results, the authors define the most important concepts visual studies; namely, visual culture, visual objects, visual essentialism and scopic regimes. In the conclusions, they emphasize the liberation of textuality that images experience in contemporary culture. The visual lends itself to interpretations that now delineate or define spectators according to their living habits or lifestyles. The way images are experienced is subject to the gaze of science or the beliefs and ideologies of those individuals who belong to a specific culture. The article offers an innovative view by revealing the rules established through scopic regimes and what characterizes a particular way of contemplating the world (a certain way of looking at things) based on the different ways of life of its actors. © 2018 American Geological Institute.

However, in the performing arts fields, academics see themselves on a spectrum between scholar and artist. Artistic scholarly research activities are often driven by the same requirements as humanities research. However, as artists, research often takes the form of listening to or watching performances.

The study uses a qualitative research design involving a total of twenty graduates of visual arts academic programs in Ghana; respondents were sampled using a purposive and snowball approach. Data collection was carried out with the help of a semi-structured interview guide and data analysis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach. Findings show that most respondents chose to pursue entrepreneurship while studying as early as senior high school level as an avenue for addressing personal financial constraints. Results indicated a preference for entrepreneurial activities in multiple art related industries for most respondents with sectors such as graphic communication design and t-shirt printing dominating. Further, responses show that respondents faced financial, operational, marketing, and managerial challenges in their entrepreneurial pursuits. It is concluded that students in our sample capitalize on the skills they acquire as part of their education to pursue predominantly craft entrepreneurship as a survival strategy. Their entrepreneurial engagements mostly focus on opportunities in their field of specialization with general and context specific challenges confronting them. It is recommended that policy makers in academia, industry, and government work together towards positioning student entrepreneurs to be growth oriented even when choosing the craft route to entrepreneurship. © 2020, University of Arkansas Press.

Over the last decade, a shift towards the rejection of canonicity has begun to take shape in art historical discourse. At the same time, algorithmically enabled practices in the US and Europe have emerged that entrench the Western canon as a locus and guarantor of aesthetic value. Operating within the epistemic framework of a “view from nowhere,” this tendency in generative art inherits the coloniality of both art history and artificial intelligence. Producing “art histories from nowhere,” this tendency conflates the conceptual category of visual art with the histories of Western cultural production. It reproduces a set of aesthetic values that entrench the mythology of the artist-genius and his imputed whiteness and masculinity; the extolment of innovation and novelty as self-evident virtues; disembodied Cartesian models of knowing and sensing; and the erasure of contributions that have been occluded from canonical visibility. As we encounter systems trained on particular visions of art history and of the artist, how might we remain attentive to the specific lens through which they are taught to see? This essay addresses that question by bringing the coloniality of recent experiments into view, bridging data feminisms and decolonial studies to formulate alternative visions of encounters between art and AI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023.","Algorithmic art; Art history; Artificial intelligence; Coloniality; Data feminism; Decolonial aesthetics","Aesthetic value; Algorithmic art; Art history; Cartesian model; Coloniality; Data feminism; Decolonial esthetic; Generative art; Training algorithms; Visual arts; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Beckwith N., Decolonizing art history, Art Hist, 43, 1, pp. 16-17, (2000); Benjamin R., Race after technology: abolitionist tools for the New Jim Code, (2019); Bennett T., The exhibitionary complex, New Form, 4, pp. 73-102, (1988); Bogost I., The art-AI gold rush is here, Atlantic, (2019); Buolamwini J., Gebru T., Gender shades: intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification, Proc of Mach Learn Res, 81, pp. 1-15, (2018); Burke J., The Italian Renaissance nude, (2018); Burke J., Decolonizing art history, Art Hist, 43, 1, pp. 17-18, (2020); Cascone S., New Rembrandt artwork created via 168,263 ‘painting fragments’.”, Artnet., (2016); Cocotle B.C., We promise to decolonize the museum: A critical view of contemporary museum policies, Afterall., (2019); Costanza-Chock S., Design justice: community-led practices to build the worlds we need, (2020); D'Ignazio C., Klein L., Data feminism, (2020); Dinkins S., ¿Human ÷ (automation + culture) = partner?, Asap/journal, 4, 2, pp. 294-297, (2019); Dinkins S., Martinez T., Towards an equitable ecosystem of artificial intelligence, The Broadcast, (2020); Doherty S.J., Art in the age of artificial intelligence, Esse, (2019); Elgammal A., Liu B., Elhoseiny M., Mazzone M., CAN: Creative adversarial networks, generating “art” by learning about styles and deviating from style norms, Doi, (2017); Elgammal A., 75% of people think this AI artist is human, Fast Co., (2018); Elgammal A., AI is blurring the definition of artist, Am Sci, (2019); Fusco C., The other history of intercultural performance, TDR, 37, 1, pp. 143-167, (1994); GrantPrice C.D., Decolonizing art history, Art Hist, 43, 1, pp. 8-66, (2000); Jones A., Art history/art criticism: performing meaning, Performing the body/performing the text, pp. 36-51, (1999); Katz Y., Artificial whiteness: politics and ideology in artificial intelligence, (2020); Kite S., Stover C., Janis M.S., Benesiinaabandan S., How to build anything ethically, The Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paperthe Initiative for Indigenous Futures and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), pp. 75-84, (2020); Kleiner F., Gardner’s art through the ages: a concise Western history, (2014); Lewis J.E., The Indigenous protocol and artificial intelligence position paper.

In contemporary artistic production, new narrative models have been developed from documents or traces from the past that have been recovered and brought to the present, and which have carried out a work similar to that of historians. The particular vision offered by Colombian visual artists, who focus their activity on the field of history, documenting the events of the armed conflict, puts into question the dominant narratives of the country. Among the different alternative strategies of narrating history, in this study we focus on the poetics of absence, used as a metaphor for disappearances and flight. We conducted an analysis based on the work of four Colombian artists (Miguel Ángel Rojas, Doris Salcedo, Óscar Muñoz, and Mariana Varela), who echo personal drama and establish a social and emotional link with the victims and their families. In these projects, the absence of the body, emptiness, is used as a form of resistance to oblivion that is able to shake the viewer’s gaze and rescue them from the amnesia in which they are immersed. © 2018 Universidad de La Sabana.

The founding of Subotnick's studio in New York was the result of unanticipated events. He had shifted from San Francisco in 1966 to serve as Music Director for Herbert Blau's Lincoln Center Repertory Theater at Vivian Beaumont Theater. The company was based at the newly opened arts complex, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Subotnick's need for additional income resulted in his decision to accept a supplementary position as one of two Artists in Residence at New York University (NYU). The Buchla Series 100, one of the first modular analog electronic musical instruments, was at the core of the music studio. The Buchla Box was designed by Buchla as an answer to an idea conceptualized by Subotnick and his peers at the San Francisco Tape Music Center between 1962 and 1963.","","Computer music; Electronic music; Music composers; New York; New York city; New York University; Performing arts; San Francisco; Transitional period; Studios","","","","","","","Battaglia A., The man who electrified the music world, The Wall Street Journal, (2011); Bernstein D., The San Francisco Tape Music Center: 1960s Counterculture and the Avant-Garde, (2008); Chadabe J., Unpublished Interview with Morton Subotnick, (1993); Chadabe J., Electric Sound: The Past and Promise of Electronic Music, (1997); Darter T., Armbruster G., The Art of Electronic Music (A Compilation of Articles from Keyboard Magazine, 1975-1983), (1984); Gluck B., Conversations with Alfredo Del Mónaco and Sergio Cervetti, (2006); Gluck R., The columbia-princeton electronic music center: Educating international composers, Proceedings of the Electroacoustic Music Studies Network 2007, (2007); Gluck R.J., The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center: Educating international composers, Computer Music Journal, 31, 2, pp. 20-38, (2007); Gluck R., Silver apples, electric circus, electronic arts, and commerce in late 1960s New York, Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference, pp. 149-152, (2009); Gluck B., Interview with eliane radigue, Array, pp. 45-49, (2010); Gluck R., Electric circus, electric ear and the inter media center in late-1960s New York, Leonardo, 45, (2012); Gluck R., Conversation with David Rosenboom on his early career: Late 1960s-early 1970s, Journal of the Society for Electroacoustic Music in the United States, (2012); Holmes T., Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture, (2008); Lobenthal J., Radical Rags: Fashions of the Sixties, (1990); Pinch T., Trocco F., Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer, (2002); Stickney J., Non-toxic psychedelia for squares, Life, 63, 6, (1967)","B.

The first, rather primitive examples of this new type of comic appeared around 1976, mostly in the form of so-called fanzines, which were directly related to the renewal of the visual arts, not only in the media, but especially those of the avantgarde. As early as 1983, the first magazines appeared that were distributed by commercial infrastructure and that aimed to renew conservative Majorcan society. This development eventually caused the comic to acquire characteristics, which gradually led this form of art towards postmodernism. The present article analyzes the role of comics as a medium of cultural renewal, arguing that the comics produced in the island be understood as an element of transcendence towards new forms of creation.","Fanzine; Marginal culture; Postmodernism; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Alary V., Historietas, Cómics y Tebeos Españoles, (2002); Capo J., Homenatge A Jaume Ramis, (2010); Crumb R., Las Confesiones de Crumb, (1978); Cuadrado J., Psicopatología de la Viñeta Cotidiana (Catecismo Neurótico Para Neoinfantes), (2000); De Espana R., Dibujar en mallorca, Ajoblanco, 9, pp. 53-54, (1988); Delhom J.M., Navarro J., Catálogo de Tebeo en España, (1980); Dols Rusinol J., Narración, figuración, historieta y arte contemporáneo, Neuróptica, 4, pp. 26-37, (1986); Dopico P., El Cómic Underground Español, 1970-1980, (2005); Ferra-Pons D., Del còmic a l'avatguarda: 'Ensenya-2, Lluc, 658, pp. 22-23, (1976); Fiol Obrador V.M., La Història de les Balears en Còmic, pp. 175-190, (2002); Jaume B., Darrera carta, de redemció, de Bartomeu Jaume, editor, Llunari, 1, pp. 3-5, (1983); Jaume B., Per què Borges?, Llunari, 3, (1985); Juncosa L., Dibuixar baix terra (plastic passion), II Setmana Del Còmic, 5, (1986); Llado Pol F., Els anys 80: entre la definició professional i la reivindicació professional, El Mirall, 117, pp. 6-8, (2000); Llado Pol F., Trenta Anys de Còmic A Mallorca, (2009); Marimon I Riutord A., Segui Aznar M., El Món Del Còmic: Ideologia, Estètica i Llenguatge, (2002); Lyotard J.-F., La Condition Postmoderne: Rapport sur le Savoir, (1979); Martinez J.T., La Polémica de la Posmodernidad, (1986); Reus Morro J., Art i Conjuntura. la Jove Plàstica A Mallorca, (1999); Pol L., Riutord M.I., Aznar S., Històries Subterrades: Els Llibres Visuals D'Andreu Terrades, pp. 315-330, (2002); Segui Aznar M., El tebeo a les Balears, El Mirall, 117, pp. 60-62, (2000); Pol L., Riutord M.I., Aznar S., Els Inicis Del Còmic Adult A Mallorca, pp. 57-67, (2002); Cusso S.I., Marta, Presentació, IV Setmana Del Còmic i la Illustració, (1988); Vidal J., Guiral A., De Espana R., Fidalgo S., De Yellow Kid A Superman, Una Visión Social Del Cómic, (1999); Vilaros T.M., El Mono Del Desencanto.

I argue that the performance embodies a call for planetary citizenship that bridges art and spirituality as well as aspects of deep ecology and political ecology. The combination of art and spirituality facilitates intimate connections between audiences and phenomena that are otherwise relatively inaccessible and difficult to grasp due to their specific philosophical, scientific, socio-political or cultural-linguistic character. Moreover, the stage play draws connections between some of the worst environmental disaster zones in Indonesia and the socio-political, religious and cultural suppression or marginalisation of the people living in the affected areas. I seek to demonstrate how its engagement with marginalised ethnic groups, cultural traditions and religions provide a foundation for environmental renewal. At the same time, some aspects of this foundation are weakened by ambiguities around the sponsorship and promotion of the production. This article discusses the play’s structure, aesthetics and representation of race and religion; its position in Nugroho’s larger socially, politically and environmentally engaged oeuvre; and the politics of promotion and sponsorship. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","art sponsorship; ecology; Indonesia; performing arts; spirituality; the environment","","","","","","","","Antoinette M., Maravillas F., Positioning Contemporary Art Worlds and Art Publics in Southeast Asia, World Art, 10, 2-3, pp. 161-189, (2020); (2020); The Planet: A Lament.

Subsequently a productive history of artistic creation has evolved throughout eventful times of political oppression and enormous social changes and challenges during the last century. Since its inauguration in 1969 the Makerere Art Gallery, located within the Margaret Trowell School of Industrial and Fine Arts, was able to accomplish an important and unique collection of art works. In addition, the exhibition space fgures prominently in displaying works of national and international artists. Yet, the collection is affected by serious archival challenges compounded with acquisition and copyright uncertainties that put the conservation of the art works in jeopardy. The recognition of works fne art as objects of cultural heritage that are valuable and need to be preserved has just begun. It remains a challenge for an institution like Makerere University to carry forward heritage conservation, and raise awareness for the importance of culture and remembrance in a rapidly changing and developing society. To pursue this the Institute of Heritage Conservation and Restoration was founded in 2011. What is or can be the role of the visual arts in conceptions of heritage?

Method: Thirty-four participants in fine arts programs and eight non-participants, all with disabilities involving neuromuscular impairment and varying degrees of cognitive impairment, completed measures of locus of control and of sense of self-determination. Results: No significant differences on quantitative measures were found among high users, low users or non-users of arts programming. Qualitative results suggest that fine arts participants, relative to non-participants, are more likely to de-emphasize “luck” in favor of effort and ambition in attributions about their circumstances and accomplishments. Conclusion: While quantitative findings did not suggest a relationship between either self-determination or locus of control and arts participation, the qualitative findings suggest that the constructs might be useful ones to study in relation to arts participation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","content analysis; qualitative data analysis; rehabilitation; social psychology; Visual arts","","","","","","National Endowment for the Arts, NEA, (14-953078)","Funding text 1: This project was supported in part by an award from the Research: Art Works program at the National Endowment for the Arts: Grant# 14-953078.

However, to date, the use of arts for the development of non-technical skills, such as teamwork and communication, has not been studied thoroughly. Methods In partnership with a community print and media arts organisation, Centre[3], we used a phenomenological approach to explore front-line mental health and social service workers’ experiences with a creative professional development workshop based on the visual and performing arts. Through preworkshop and postworkshop interviews with participants and postworkshop interviews with their managers, we sought to examine how participants’ perceptions of the workshop compared with their preworkshop expectations, specific impacts of the workshop with respect to participants’ teamwork and communication skills and changes in their perceptions regarding the use of the arts in professional development. Results Our workshops were successful in enhancing teamwork skills among participants and showed promise in the development of communication skills, though observable changes in workplace communication could not be confirmed. The workshop facilitated teamwork and collegiality between colleagues, creating a more enjoyable and accepting work environment. The workshops also helped participants identify the strengths and weaknesses of their communication skills, made them more comfortable with different communication styles and provided them with strategies to enhance their communication skills. Conclusions Participation in the arts can be beneficial for the development of interpersonal skills such as teamwork and communication among health professionals. © 2016 Medical Humanities.

In the light of this basic assumption, it is argued that, due to poetic seeing, interconnectedness between art1, spirituality and the human quest for meaning exists. It is virtually impossible to define art. However, in one way or another, art is connected to imagination, inspiration and creativity. Art probes into the realm of the unseen, thus the value of iconic seeing in visual arts. By means of art, objects are moved into imagination and connected to the 'idea' beyond the vision of phenomenological observation. Serious art probes into the dimension of the unseen; it makes the invisible, visible. Art deals inter alia with 'signals of transcendence' (Peter Berger)2 and opens up new avenues for religious thinking and spiritual experiences. Serious art can thus contribute to the healing dimension of spiritual wholeness. Art can even assist theology in the reframing of existing God-images. In this regard, the notions of a Compassionate God and God as Covenantal Partner for Life, become appropriate alternatives for the imperialistic pantokrator-images (omni-categories) of theism. © 2015.

As this essay illustrates Bragg’s interest in language and visualization was inspired by literature and the visual arts which, in turn, profoundly affected his approach to science.

The objective of the discourse is to examine how the visual arts training and practice equip students with skills in visual literacy through methods of production, materials and techniques. The research purpose is to show how the final year students trained in visual arts are able to create works of art with the primary goal of communicating meanings visually to the viewers. The photographed student’s works ranged from sculpture showing traditional drummers, spiders as a motif for creative exploration in painting, graphic poster design emphasizing economy of time, two decorative ceramic pieces and a woven utilitarian textile fibre. For the students to have successfully communicated visually they ought to be able to effectively manipulate the art elements and principles which makes it possible to encode meanings to their works and the viewers been able to decode same. The research results evident in the students photographed works, show that students are able to organize their ideas in a visual form and are able to use images to convey meanings in their works which viewers can relate to. In this regard, the students are able to encode and decode meanings in visual forms which are fundamental to visual literacy as practiced in visual arts. The correlation between visual arts training and visual literacy is established through the observation of a long teaching career which record student’s behaviour in the creative process and its results in productions. Findings show that students training in the visual arts equip them to develop their perceptual and conceptual faculties through learning, to use appropriate visual vocabularies in decoding and encoding visual messages. This also equips them with a holistic education in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. It is therefore concluded that the visual arts training is critical to the acquisition of visual literacy skills and it is recommended that visual arts should be more broadly taught in schools as a foundation for visual literacy. © 2017, © 2017 International Visual Literacy Association.","Bloom’s taxonomy; exhibition; images; perceptual and conceptual skills; visual arts; visual communication; visual learning; Visual literacy","","","","","","","","Avgerinou M., Ericson J., A review of the concept of visual literacy, British Journal of Educational Technology, 28, pp. 280-291, (1997); Avgerinou M., Petterson R., Toward a cohesive theory of visual literacy, Journal of Visual Literacy, 30, pp. 1-19, (2011); Bloom B., Engelhart M., Furst E., Hill W., Krathwohl D., Taxonomy of educational objectives: Cognitive domain, (2013); Brill J.M., Kim D., Branch R.M., Visual literacy defined: The results of a Delphi study IVLA (operationally) define visual literacy, Exploring the visual future: Art, design, science and technology, pp. 9-15, (2001); Dondis D., A premier of visual literacy, (1973); Edwards B., Drawing on the right side of the brain, (2012); Elkins J., Visual literacy, (2010); Messaris P., Visual literacy and visual culture, (1995); Mithen S., The prehistory of the mind: The cognitive origins of art, and science, (1996); Moore D., Action and object language, Visual literacy–A spectrum of visual learning, (1994); Morgan J., Welton P., An introduction to visual communication, (1992); Radford T., (2004); Twyman M., (1972); Velders T., (1999)","V.

The Orient Museum comprises a large collection of Chinese art and material culture which offers a wider perspective of Greater China. One aspect of the collection provides a ‘mirror’ of the cultural and artistic exchange between Portugal and China, while the other presents another perspective on China, focusing on the regional distinctiveness of Chinese ethnicity, religious traditions and the unique artistic practices of different regions of China. Unlike the typical porcelain, silk, furniture and other artworks that became familiar to Europeans as a result of global trade during the Modern period, the folk art and popular material culture from different regions presents another perspective on Chinese art and culture, traditionally considered within the scope of ethnography and therefore unworthy of display in encyclopaedic or art museums in the West. The main topics discussed in this paper include how Western communities perceive Chinese artistic, cultural and religious heterogeneity, how the museum acts as a place for intercultural dialogue through curatorial practices and parallel activities, the role of the museum in the conception of a non-stereotypical image of China, and the preservation of regional cultures as part of Greater China. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","appropriate museology; Chinese art; exhibitions; folk art; performing arts; popular culture; post-colonialism; ritual objects","","","","","","","","Alberts E., A History of Daoism and the Yao People of South China, (2006); Chen F.P.L., Chinese Shadow Theatre: History, Popular Religion and Women Warriors, (2007); Belting H., Contemporary art and the museum in a global age, Contemporary Art and the Museum: A Global Perspective, pp. 16-41, (2007); Eno R., The Analects of Confucius: An Online Teaching Translation, (2012); Falcao L., Preservation of ethnographic repairs in Asiatic shadow puppets: Different decisions, different views in the same collection, IIC 2006 Munich Congress: Object in Context - Crossing Conservation Boundaries, pp. 309-319, (2006); Fur Y.L., D'un regard l'autre: Histoire des regards européens sur l'Afrique, l'Amérique et l'Océanie, (2006); Giraudon C., Les arts à Paris chez Paul Guillaume, 1918–1935, (1993); Karp I., Culture and representation, Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum Display, pp. 11-24, (1991); Kreps C., Appropriate museology in theory and practice, Museum Management and Curatorship, 23, 1, pp. 23-41, (2007); Koch F., Revisiting the first official bi-national panorama exhibitions of contemporary Chinese Art in Europe: Living in Time (Berlin, 2001) and Alors, la Chine?

We provide a new perspective by arguing that such a relationship must consider the heterogeneity of consumers and experts alike. This article addresses the issue of quality evaluation of performing arts, and the purpose is to determine the relationship between, on the one hand, the criteria adopted for quality assessment, and on the other hand, the preferences for particular theater performances. This is done by simultaneously considering heterogeneity among the consumers and among the critics, which is a new approach in the literature. Using data from newspaper critics’ evaluations and from surveys completed by a sample of operagoers at the Royal Danish National Theater, we perform a multilevel latent class analysis, and we find three distinctive segments: The the unexperienced audience, the conventional connoisseurs and the unconventional avant-gardes. The avant-garde consumers and experts are localized as a distinct segment of audience, with different preferences and different evaluation criteria than the other audience segments (the conventional connoisseurs and the unexperienced audience). Newness and innovation are the most important criteria for the avant-garde consumer segment. The goal of an opera house or a theater is not just to increase attendance and revenue, but equally to innovate the artform. In this perspective, the avant-garde consumers are an important segment for the opera houses and producers of other cultural products, and a better understanding of the early adopters of artistic innovation (the avant-garde consumers), their preferences, evaluation criteria, and behavior, would seem to be crucial information. We suggest future empirical research could focus on avant-garde consumers as an important segment of the audience. © 2023","Avant-gardes consumers; Consumer behavior; Heterogeneity; Latent class analysis; Performing arts; Quality evaluation","","","","","","","","Abbe-Decarroux F., The perception of quality and the demand for services: Empirical application to the performing arts, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 23, 1, pp. 99-107, (1994); Adorno T., Horkheimer M., (1944); Assessi I., The programming strategies and relationships of theatres: An analysis based on the French experience, International Journal of Arts Management, 9, 3, pp. 50-64, (2007); Augustin M.D., Leder H., Art Expertise: A study of concepts and conceptual spaces, Psychology Science, 48, 2, pp. 135-156, (2006); Baldin A., Bille T., Theater Management – quality indicators and demand, Paper presented at the 8th European Workshop on Applied Cultural Economics, Krakow, Poland, (2017); Baldin A., Bille T., Modelling preference heterogeneity for theatre tickets: A discrete choice modelling approach on Royal Danish Theatre booking data, Applied economics, 50, 5, pp. 545-558, (2018); Baldin A., Bille T., Ellero A., Favaretto D., Revenue and attendance simultaneous optimization in performing arts organizations, Journal of cultural economics, 42, 4, pp. 677-700, (2018); Basuroy S., Ravid S.A., Tretz R.T., Allen B.J., Is everybody an expert?

Contemporary appreciation of non-European artists' contribution to the development of modern art was reflected, for instance, in the ground-breaking exhibition held in 1984 at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), titled Primitivism in 20th-century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern, curated by the influential art critic and director of this institution, William S. Rubin. Even before that, however, reflections on the phenomenon of primitivism had been based on the combined exhibitions of tribal art and modern art, such as a display of Picasso's works combined with African sculptures, organized in Berlin and in Dresden in1913, as well as the presentation of African art at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 Gallery in New York. Deeper and broader reflection on the importance of the contribution of tribal cultures (including, of course, African culture) to modern art appeared in 1938 in Robert Goldwater's book entitled Primitivism in Modern Art. The avant-gardists' expectations concerning so-called primitive art varied. Most often, they sought formal inspirations (Cubist painters, modern sculptors Constantin Brancusi, Pablo Gargallo, Alberto Giacometti, Jacques Lipchitz). However, some artists have looked to it for new representations and symbols as well as a source of human creativity. The article concludes with the words of Georges Salles that the art of black Africa has renewed European artistic scene.

To achieve this objective, the classic story Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is used as a reference showing the different uses of color in the story and their transversality. This analysis is part of the research project “Color as a narrative means in the illustration of classic stories: Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Alice in Wonderland” where color is worked as a plastic sign and therefore with narrative value within the visual images which aims to identify the characteristics and color features that allow a visual narrative. In order to go deeper into the subject, one of the points worked focuses on the transversality of color from the text to the image, where it is intended to establish if there is a relationship between the use of color in the writings of the classic stories and the use of color as a plastic sign in the images resulting from them. This analysis was carried out through dialogue with authors of the medium and bibliographic analysis which resulted in an approach to the concept of transversality of color as one of the characteristics that determines the narrative character of color in visual images.

This protection allows people in twenty-first century Seoul to attend performances of raucous mask dance dramas, evocative epic songs, and sedate literati ensembles. However, do they? The audience for Korean traditional arts is eroding, but ample government support has removed artists and venues from the urgency of attracting new and younger audiences. This article describes reception techniques of traditional performance that are dying out in Korea, proposes an audience typology, and discusses the varied challenges of attracting and maintaining an audience.

However such research has been restricted to the examination of children attending mainstream schooling across the UK. The present study therefore compared the views and practices of key parties involved in mainstream and performing arts educational contexts. Teachers and children were interviewed and parents completed a postal survey. Some 225 children, 115 of their teachers and 176 of their parents and carers formed the mainstream school group whilst 180 children, 42 of their teachers and 145 of their parents and carers formed the performing arts school group. Main findings indicated that pupils', parents' and teachers' views about the benefits, and how to support drawing behaviour at school and at home, varied across contrasting educational contexts. In particular, pupils attending arts-based schools and their teachers valued expressivity over technical support, pupils reported enjoying drawing more, had higher self efficacy and foresaw engaging in the activity beyond their school years more than their mainstream counterparts. The results suggest that mainstream educational contexts could foster drawing behaviour and the related emotional benefits to a greater extent. © 2015 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Art; Drawing; Education; Mainstream; Performing arts","","","","","","","","Adams E., Drawing Insights, (2006); Anning A., A conversation around young children's drawing: the impact of the beliefs of significant others at home and at school, International Journal of Art & Design Education, 21, 3, pp. 197-208, (2002); Anning A., Pathways to the graphicacy club: the crossroads of home and pre-school, Journal of Early Childhood Literacy, 3, 1, pp. 5-35, (2003); Arnheim R., Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye.

Focusing on the corresponding effects on embodiment, corporeality and performativity, it considers the sensori-perceptual ‘re-creation’, reorganization, deconstruction and reconstruction involved when the body interacts with, is ‘touched’ by, and ‘incorporates’ the effects of technology. While taking into consideration a current context of research-creation and its conceptual prerogatives, the article centres on the question of technological intervention from the perspective of its encounter(s) with the sensate, somatic body. Based on the premise of the body as a living perceptual entity, adaptive biological phenomenon and indeed, technology in its own right, the author redefines a contemporary status of the body while analysing the artistic strategies employed to inscribe the mediated body and its manifestations within a contemporary artistic production. The article concludes by suggesting that the phenomenological mediation of the performative body is an evolutive form of the sensate, somatic body that could have the potential to bring about the emergence of another form of embodiment and intercorporeality, or even, another form of dance specific to the twenty-first century.

If people want to know the different types of art that exist, how individual works are connected, and how works of art are interpreted and discussed in the context of other works, they must utilize means other than simply viewing the art. Therefore, this paper proposes a language to analyze, describe, and explore collections of visual art (LadeCA). LadeCA combines human interpretation and automatic analyses of images, allowing users to assess collections of visual art without viewing every image in them. This paper focuses on the lexical base of LadeCA. It also outlines how collections of visual art can be analyzed, described, and explored using a LadeCA vocabulary. Additionally, the relationship between LadeCA and indexing systems, such as ICONCLASS or AAT, is demonstrated, and ways in which LadeCA and indexing systems can complement each other are highlighted.

Based on the literature, we develop and test a moderated-mediation model that investigated the mediating role of psychological contract breach in the relationship between relational psychological contract and loyal boosterism, and the extent to which this relationship is moderated by conscientiousness. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 281 full-time dancers in training in Australia. Results of the PROCESS analyses support the notion that individuals with higher relational psychological contract tend to have lower perceptions of psychological contract breach, which results in higher levels of loyal boosterism, and that the relationship is attenuated for individuals high on conscientiousness. Such an effect has important implications for how performing art organizations manage expectations of performers in training and how they should intervene if psychological contract breach occurs. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","conscientiousness; dance; loyal boosterism; performing arts; Psychological contract; vocation","","","","","","","","Bankins S., A Process Perspective on Psychological Contract Change: Making Sense of, and Repairing, Psychological Contract Breach and Violation through Employee Coping Actions, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 36, 8, pp. 1071-1095, (2015); Barrick M.R., Mount M.K., The Big Five Personality Dimensions and Job Performance: A Meta-analysis, Personnel Psychology, 44, 1, pp. 1-26, (1991); Bellou V., Shaping Psychological Contracts in the Public and Private Sectors: A Human Resource Management Perspective, International Public Management Journal, 10, 3, pp. 327-349, (2007); Bennett D., Academy and the Real World: Developing Realistic Notions of Career in the Performing Arts, Arts and Humanities in Higher Education, 8, pp. 309-327, (2009); Blau P.M., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Bollen K.A., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Bordia P., Restubog S.L.D., Tang R.L., When Employees Strike Back: Investigating Mediating Mechanisms between Psychological Contract Breach and Workplace Deviance, Journal of Applied Psychology, 93, 5, pp. 1104-1117, (2008); Bordia P., Restubog S.L.D., Bordia S., Tang R.L., Breach Begets Breach: Trickle-down Effects of Psychological Contract Breach on Customer Service, Journal of Management, 36, 6, pp. 1578-1607, (2010); Bordia S., Hobman E., Restubog S.L.D., Bordia P., Advisor Student Relation in Business Education Project Collaboration: A Psychological Contract Perspective, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 40, 9, pp. 2360-2386, (2010); Bordia S., Bordia P., Restubog S.L.D., Promises from Afar: A Model of International Student Psychological Contracts in Business Education, Studies in Higher Education, 40, 2, pp. 212-232, (2015); Cianci A.M., Klein H.J., Seijts G.H., The Effect of Negative Feedback on Tension and Subsequent Performance: The Main and Interactive Effects of Goal Content and Conscientiousness, Journal of Applied Psychology, 95, 4, pp. 618-630, (2010); Coffey J., The Agony and Ecstasy of Being a Ballet Dancer: Why Do They Do It?, Proceedings of the 7th Annual Pacific Employment Relations Association Conference, pp. 1-12, (2007); Conway N., Briner R.B., Fifty Years of Psychological Contract Research: What Do We Know and What are the Main Challenges?, International Review of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 21, pp. 71-131, (2009); Coyle-Shapiro J.A.M., A Psychological Contract Perspective on Organizational Citizenship Behaviour, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23, 8, pp. 927-946, (2002); Coyle-Shapiro J.A.M., Kessler I., Consequences of the Psychological Contract for the Employment Relationship: A Large Scale Survey, Journal of Management Studies, 37, 7, pp. 903-930, (2000); De Campos P.A., The Relationship between Coaches and Athletes: The Psychological Contract Theory in Sports, Conference paper for International Congress of Sport Science, (2000); De Vos A., Buyens D., Schalk R., Making Sense of a New Employment Relationship: Psychological Contract-related Information Seeking and the Role of Work Values and Locus of Control, International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 13, 1, pp. 41-52, (2005); DelCampo R., Psychological Contract Violation: An Individual Difference Perspective, International Journal of Management, 24, 1, pp. 43-52, (2007); Dick P., The Psychological Contract and the Transition from Full Time to Part Time Police Work, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 27, 1, pp. 37-58, (2006); Foa U.G., Foa E.B., Resource Theory: Interpersonal Behavior as Exchange, Social Exchange, Advances in Theory and Research, pp. 77-94, (1980); Garcia P.R.J.M., Bordia P., Restubog S.L.D., Caines V., Sleeping with a Broken Promise: The Moderating Role of Generativity Concerns in the Relationship between Psychological Contract Breach and Insomnia among Older Workers, Journal of Organizational Behavior, (2017); Ho V.T., Weingart L.R., Rousseau D.M., Responses to Broken Promises: Does Personality Matter?, Journal of Vocational Behaviour, 65, 2, pp. 276-293, (2004); Hurtz G., Donovan J., Personality and Job Performance: The Big Five Revisited, Journal of Applied Psychology, 85, 6, pp. 869-879, (2000); John O., Donahue E., Kentle R., The Big Five Inventory, (1991); Judge T.A., Ilies R., Relationship of Personality to Performance Motivation: A Meta-analytic Review, Journal of Applied Psychology, 87, 4, pp. 797-807, (2002); Liao-Troth M.A., Attitude differences between paid workers and volunteers, Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 11, 4, (2001); Low C.H., Bordia P., Bordia S., What Do Employees Want and Why?

In particular it questions the Serbs' perceived affiliation with the Byzantine Empire and challenges the view that this affiliation was so pervasive that it influenced Serbian development and national formation in the modern age. It is argued that Byzantium had little if any role in the Serbs' cultural development – neither in historical memories nor in surviving traditions. Serbia's Byzantine culture is largely a myth developed in the 1930s by the Serbian clergy as a corollary of the Russian-inspired Svetosavlje ideology. This myth was meant to dislocate Serbia's cultural identity from its secular European sources and reposition it closer to Orthodox Russia. © 2016 Association for the Study of Nationalities.","Byzantium; heritage; identity; Serbia; Svetosavlje; visual arts","Serbia; art; cultural heritage; cultural history; cultural identity; ideology; material culture; Middle Ages; perception","","","","","","","Agadjanian A., Rousselet K., Globalization and Identity Discourse in Russian Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy in a Global Age: Tradition Faces the Twenty-First Century, pp. 29-57, (2005); Anderson B., Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, (1991); Angelov D.G., Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe, New Approaches to Balkan Studies, pp. 3-23, (2003); Anzulovic B., Heavenly Serbia: From Myth to Genocide, (1999); Bakic-Hayden M., Nesting Orientalisms: The Case of Former Yugoslavia, Slavic Review, 54, 4, pp. 917-931, (1995); Bakic-Hayden M., Hayden R.M., Orientalist Variations on the Theme Balkans: Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics, Slavic Review, 51, 1, pp. 1-15, (1992); Banac I., (1984); Beckwith J., Early Christian and Byzantine Art, (1979); Bellamy A.J., The Formation of Croatian National Identity.

Sharing files on social media is common, with Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo used most frequently. Although these are popular social media platforms, they do not have enhanced format support and robust metadata. Additionally, licensing terms for each platform differ, and may be not in the best interest of the musician. Although recordings are not traditionally considered data, data curation principles can be applied to these types of files, and the library is positioned to become an active participant in this process. © 2016 Amy S.

Using iconography, we attempt to establish how various players have created visual identities based on iconic archaeological artefacts and places. We discern that archaeological evidence has played a vital role in the invention and re-invention of national identity and patriotic iconography. Archaeological evidence has influenced the branding of corporate bodies, including universities, which are the major focus of this paper. Visual manifestations of the ancient Zimbabwe Culture (madzimbahwe), especially Great Zimbabwe, dominate the branding process. The Zimbabwe bird, Conical Tower, and motifs associated with the drystone built heritage form the key visual elements in the country’s branding enterprise. We advance the argument that the period associated with madzimbahwe has been projected as the only ‘Golden Age’ of ancient Zimbabwe. Consequently, other heritages, diverse histories, and past cultural achievements have been marginalised. © The Author(s) 2021.","Archaeology; branding; heritage; iconography; identity politics; nationhood;

The survey data clearly indicate the significance of education as a driver to develop future audiences. There are nine major performing arts organisations funded by the Hong Kong government, and they share the responsibility of shaping the performing arts landscape. This study explored the role of outreach and education within these major performing arts organisations and how they impact audience development. In addition to document analysis and fieldwork, the researcher interviewed five cultural leaders from the nine performing arts organisations. The findings of this study indicate that while the organisations’ outreach and education engagement help to achieve various important educational goals, direct impact on ticket sales is not easily quantifiable and may occur in the long run. This study concludes by offering a proposed conceptual framework for outreach and education when they are positioned in non-profit performing arts organisations. The four layers in the proposed conceptual framework involve cognitive, affective, ethical, and behavioural dimensions. It contributes to reframing the conceptualisation of audience development for the performing arts and sheds new light on the future of outreach and education in arts organisations and policymaking in arts and culture, with far-reaching implications for other non-profit cultural organisations in Hong Kong and globally. © 2021, Fudan University.","Arts education; Audience development; Cultural management; Outreach; Performing arts","","","","","","Chung Ying Theatre Company; City Contemporary Dance Company; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK, (4051124)","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the Research Direct Grant from the Faculty of Arts, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Project Reference Number: 4051124, CUHK). ; Funding text 2: The author would like to sincerely thank Mr. Raymond Wong Managing Director, City Contemporary Dance Company), Ms. Meggy Cheng (Director of Marketing, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra), Ms. Patricia Sun (Head of Programme, Education and Touring, Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra), Ms. Kitty Kong (Education and Outreach Manager, Chung Ying Theatre Company), and Mr. Luka Wong (Manager, PR and Partnership Development, Zuni Icosahedron) for their kind support of this research. ; Funding text 3: The author would like to sincerely thank Mr. Raymond Wong (Managing?Director, City Contemporary Dance Company), Ms. Meggy Cheng (Director?of Marketing, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra), Ms. Patricia Sun (Head of Programme, Education and Touring, Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra), Ms. Kitty Kong (Education and Outreach Manager, Chung Ying Theatre Company), and Mr. Luka Wong (Manager, PR and Partnership Development, Zuni Icosahedron) for their kind support of this research.","Arts nation: An overview of Australian arts, (2015); Barrett M.S., Belonging, being and becoming musical: An introduction to children’s musical worlds, Children, Meaning-Making and the Arts, pp. 57-84, (2003); Bennett T., Emmison M., Frow J., Accounting for tastes: Australian everyday cultures, (1999); Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, Trans.

The current production of jokes is explored in this article, using interviews with stand-up comedians and the current literature of comedy. Comedians reveal a serious devotion to their joke writing, spending working time trawling their own experience and cultural exposure for potentially comic material which they then can structure as jokes. In carrying out this task, they are strongly concerned that the material they create will represent a message that is true to themselves (or “authentic”) rather than merely amusing. They use social media to test material and build their profile with potential audiences. In doing so, they accept the collateral effect that their jokes will quickly enter the communally owned resource of comic content that circulates orally and electronically. © The Author(s) 2015.","Communication; Communication studies; Cultural communication; Culture; New media; Performing arts; Technology","","","","","","","","Bakhtin M., Rabelais and His World, (1968); Carr J., Greeves L., The Naked Jape: Uncovering the Hidden World of Jokes, (2006); Fisher J., Funny Way to Be a Hero, (1973); Freud S., The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious, (2002); Griffin S., Ken Dodd: The Biography, (2005); Harding J., George Robey and the Music Hall, (1990); Henkle R., Comedy and Culture: England 1820-1900, (1980); Holt J., Stop Me If you’ve Heard This: A History and Philosophy of Jokes, (2008); Jacobson H., Seriously Funny: From the Ridiculous to the Sublime, (1997); Lee S., How I Escaped My Certain Fate: The Life and Deaths of a Stand-Up Comedian, (2010); Legman G., Rationale of the Dirty Joke, (1968); Lockyer S., Pickering M., Beyond a Joke: The Limits of Humour, (2005); McCann G., Frankie Howerd: Stand-Up Comedian, (2004); McCann G., Spike & Co: Inside the House of Fun with Milligan, Sykes, Galton and Simpson, (2006); Medhurst A., A National Joke: Popular Comedy and English Cultural Identities, (2007); Monkhouse B., Crying with Laughter: An Autobiography., (1993); Moreall J., Taking Laughter Seriously, (1983); Nathan D., The Laughtermakers: A Quest for Comedy, (1971); Palmer J., Taking Humour Seriously, (1994); Parker D., Radio: The Great Years, (1977); Ritchie C., Performing Live Comedy, (2012); Russell H., Heard the One about the Invasion of the Danish Comedians?, (2013); Schneider D., Help-They’re Stealing Our Gags, 15, 11, (2009); Sturges P., Comedy as freedom of expression, Journal of Documentation, 66, pp. 279-293, (2010); Wolfe R., Writing Comedy: A Guide to Scriptwriting for TV, Radio, Film and Stage, (1992)","P.

Both are coinciding with media representations of lesbianism and lesbian visual arts, the latter beginning with the shocking exhibition 'Obscene Women' by Austrian photographer Krista Beinstein in 1986. The international lesbian exhibition 'Lesbian ConneXions', which visited the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana in October 2000, represented images of lesbians in a very broad and realistic spectrum, in contrast with the asexual lesbian photographs by unknown authors in the Slovenian mainstream press and in accordance with the depictions of lesbians in Slovenian lesbian press. The photographs from 'Lesbian ConneXions' were, like Beinstein's exhibition, not very well accepted; even some lesbians argued that some of the photos, especially those of gender-benders, did not represent real and everyday lesbian life but rarities and odd exceptions. But lesbian life in general, far from being an 'ordinary' Slovenian lifestyle, may easily become unrecognizable to lesbians themselves and obscured by the dominant culture.","Culture; Images; Lesbian and gay movement; Media representations; Visibility; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Bakker M., Lesbian Connexion/s, Exhibition Catalogue, (2000); Gabric A.P.K., Rajster B., Odvetnica in Pisateljica Ljuba Prenner, (2000)","S.

This primary research centers on the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black artists called on for the first time to discuss the successes and challenges of teaching culturally responsive arts in diverse Ontario classrooms. This qualitative study uses critical race theory to examine their experiences of working in Greater Toronto schools and surrounding areas in Ontario, Canada. Using cultural arts from across the African diaspora as a tool, their artistic work is situated within culturally relevant pedagogy, which is an alternative approach to centering on identity, cultural frames of reference, and critical student learning. Yet, as these Black Canadian artists garner successful impacts from culturally responsive teaching in classroom space, they identify simultaneous challenges of institutional unpreparedness, anti-Black racism, cultural appropriation, and legitimizing their cultural artistry to school administration. Semi-structured interviews include rich narratives from artists specializing in contemporary and traditional expressions of orality, visual arts, dance, and drumming/percussion from the African diaspora. While navigating instances of unbelonging, recommendations are proposed to improve the understanding of the artists' role and improve Canadian educational institutions' relationship with Black creatives in inclusive education. © 2021","African diaspora; African/Caribbean arts; Artist perspectives; Black Canadian artists; Cultural arts education; Culturally relevant; Culturally responsive teaching; Inclusive education; Performing arts","","","","","","","","Murray Collette, Who Tells and Cries Our Freedom?, The Dance Current, Canada's Dance Magazine, (2018); Culturally relevant pedagogy discussed in the Ontario Ministry of Education, Equity Action Plan; Gay Geneva, Teaching to and through Cultural Diversity, Curriculum Inquiry, 43, (2013); Scheurich James Joseph, Young Michelle D., Coloring Epistemologies: Are Our Research Epistemologies Racially Biased?, Educational Researcher, 26, 4, pp. 4-16, (1997); Ladson-Billings Gloria, But That's Just Good Teaching!

Correlation in teaching represents a modern approach to teaching, which implies an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary concept in connecting teaching content. The modern curriculum in religious education recognizes the importance of correlation in teaching. The inclusion of works of art in religious education can contribute to the overall development of pupils and can enable better understanding and perception of religious content. In this study, which involved 199 primary and secondary school pupils, we wanted to examine pupils’ perception of the use of works or art in religious education. The results showed that pupils sometimes observe works of art during classes, and that older pupils prefer to observe works of art in comparison to younger pupils. Works of art used during religious education classes positively influence the adoption of religious content, and affect the creativity and activity of pupils in class. Girls, more so than boys, prefer when they can express themselves creatively in class with the use of a work of art and when they can share ideas and experiences based on artwork. The use of art during religious education positively affects the correlation with the Croatian language and history, especially among older pupils. Older pupils also stated that observing works of art helps them understand the environment in the context of faith. © 2020 Christian Academic Circle.

They may play with expectations regarding genre and form. Reading them may require knowledge of the sign systems that are characteristic of the referenced non-literary art forms. Intermedial novels question traditional views of the possibilities of the novel - such as linear narrative and conventional presentation formats -by challenging how readers process media-specific communication and how readers translate form and content into meaning. Contemplating specific semiotic systems along with historical contexts of artistic production and reception produces intermedial readings that consider both the respective signification processes at work in a novel and the continuously changing cultural embeddedness of art forms and their expressive potential. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Cultural practices; Intermediality; Music; Narrativity; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Balestrini N.W., From Fiction to Libretto: Irving, Hawthorne, and James as Opera, (2005); Balestrini N.W., Adaptation and American Studies: Perspectives on Research and Teaching, (2011); Brillenburg Wurth K., Old and New Medialities in Foer's Tree of Codes, CLCWeb, 13, 3, (2011); de Vries G., Johnson D.B., Nabokov and the Art of Painting, (2006); Eilitta L., Introduction: From Interdisciplinarity to Intermediality, Intermedial Arts: Disrupting, Remembering and Transforming Media, pp. vii-xiii, (2012); Foer J.S., Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, (2005); Hallet W., The Rise of the Multimodal Novel: Generic Change and Its Narratological Implications, Storyworlds Across Media: Toward a Media-Conscious Narratology, pp. 151-172, (2014); Hustvedt S., The Blazing World, (2014); Hutcheon L., A Theory of Adaptation, (2013); Jones E.P., The Known World, (2004); Larsen R., The Young and Prodigious T.S.

This paper is the result of direct participation, observation, and assistance by the hospitals, medical staff, and students who are organize hands-on projects and interactive art sessions designed to serve patients directly. The Arts in Hospital program is a useful tool in engaging community participation and communication among students and hospital staff. It provides a learning opportunity to students, and a creative outlet for patients on extended care. Active participation by students has a very positive impact on by giving them practical outlets to exercise their creativity and knowledge, while hospitals benefit through their service, which also cuts costs.

Incorporating insights from these fields provides an alternative approach to the questions of who, what, and for how long we should remember. After establishing a conceptual framework for the mobilisation of rituals of artistic practice and cultural memory, this article discusses examples from a range of cultures and performance practices to explore aesthetic and ethical characteristics of performative memorials. It concludes that performance’s self-consciously ephemeral, temporal, and iterative character means performative memorials can refocus the commemorative impulse away from the past by shifting our collective attention from the question of what should we remember to the question of what should we remember for?. © The author(s) 2020.","Commemoration; embodiment; ethics; music; performance; performing arts; repertoire; violence","","","","","","","","Adorno Theodor W., Noten zur Literatur, III, (1965); Adorno Theodor W., Prismen—Kulturkritik und Gesellschaft, Gesammelte Schriften, 10a, (1977); Anderson James C., Dean Jeffrey T., Moderate Autonomism, British Journal of Aesthetics, 38, 2, pp. 150-166, (1998); Anderson Kristin L., Umberson Debra, Gendering Violence: Masculinity and Power in Men’s Accounts of Domestic Violence, Gender and Society, 15, 1, pp. 358-380, (2001); Anderson Patrick, Menon Jisha, Introduction, Violence Performed: Local Roots and Global Contexts of Conflict, (2009); Austin J.

Eleven chapters cover the public sphere, music, the visual arts, political culture, literature, the role of the state and national languages. Among the topics discussed are the decline in the degree and importance of patronage by the churches and the nobility; the corresponding expansion in the role played by the anonymous public and the market; the decline of international languages in favour of national vernaculars; the importance of the 'other' in determining a sense of national identity; and the growing appreciation by the state of the significance of the 'fine arts' as being conducive to social harmony, economic prosperity and political stability. © The British Academy 2006.

An examination of the iconography in three classic paintings demonstrates that “Masque” has much in common with the vanitas genre—for example, a profusion of pleasurable items appealing to the voluptuary, the jarring collocation of death imagery amid these pleasurable objects, images of clocks representing the passing of time, the motif of music symbolizing the transient, the use of somber colors (the black room of Prospero’s imperial suite) to suggest the apocalyptic, the notion of the wealthy and powerful being brought low by death, the theme of weaponry incapable of fending off this leveler, the concept of extinguished flames connoting the ease with which life expires, and biblical language and imagery echoing the moralistic Latin messages sometimes featured in the paintings. When the “Masque” narrator refers to the “assembly of phantasms such as I have painted,” Poe gives us a further clue that he was thinking about the vanitas productions of the Dutch Golden Age. As a prose-painter of a vanitas trilogy and a critic who despised the blatantly moralistic in art, however, Poe should be related to the less obviously didactic vanitas artists who preferred their didacticism wrapped up in disguised symbolism, hidden allegories—which method correlates precisely with Poe’s own literary techniques and critical prescriptions. © 2019 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.","Didacticism in art; Iconography; The Masque of the Red Death; Vanitas paintings; visual arts","","","","","","","","","","","Penn State University Press","","","","","","21500428","","","","English","Edgar Allan Poe Rev.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068842094"

Cultural products—including the visual arts—present one medium through which people may manifest their dominant culture. The present research investigates the appreciation of visual arts cross-culturally by hypothesizing and testing a cultural-match effect (i.e., people tend to appreciate same-culture artworks more than they appreciate different-culture artworks). Additionally, the present work considers the factors of historical period and art medium that have been overlooked in previous research. A mixed 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 design, 97 Western and 91 Eastern naïve viewers from Poland and Hong Kong were presented with 128 visual artworks varying in artwork culture (West vs. East), historical period (traditional vs. contemporary), and art medium (painting vs. mural). In a repeated measures fashion, the participants evaluated each artwork in terms of art identification, liking, understanding, and familiarity, and their art expertise and art interest were also measured. Supporting the hypothesis, the Polish group tended to appreciate Western (i.e., same-culture) artworks more than Eastern (i.e., different-culture) artworks. However, contrary to our prediction, the Hong Kong group also tended to appreciate Western (i.e., different-culture) artworks more than Eastern (i.e., same-culture) artworks, and that might be attributed to the Western influence Hong Kong had received during its British colonial years. Furthermore, cultural-match effect did not readily generalize across historical periods nor across art media. Potential confounding of art expertise and art interest as well as limitations and future directions are discussed. © 2022 American Psychological Association","aesthetic experience; art appreciation; cross-cultural; cultural-match effect; visual arts","","","","","","College of Professional and Continuing Education; Jolanta Krawczykiewicz and Słupsk Cultural Center; Society for the Psychology of Aesthetics; American Psychological Association, APA; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawla II, (SSHD-2021-237[I])","This research was supported by a micro grant from the Society for the Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts (Division 10 of the American Psychological Association), an internal grant from the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, and Grant (SSHD-2021-237[I]) from the College of Professional and Continuing Education, an affiliate of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

In the early 21st century Castellucci accomplishes on stage Artaud’s theory about the abolition of the text of the play and the creation of a new theatrical language. In an attempt to find a different kind of communication between the artist and his audience, the director excludes the text and gives shape to universal and non-realistic images. This contemporary representation fills the spectator with intense feelings and deep emotions. The audience considers Castellucci’s performances as a strong experience, because, as the director explains, the images he creates remove living matter from time and space.1 Making use of the grotesque, the director creates a nightmarish universe. In this world the monstrous depicts all modern man’s hidden desires, metaphysical concerns, and terrors. Using as a point of reference the performance of Dante’s Divine Comedy directed by Castellucci and presented by Societas Rafaello Sanzio in 2008, this chapter will explore the pioneer, delirious environment in which human beings, animals, and modern technology combine and depict the trilogy ‘Inferno’, ‘Purgatory’, ‘Paradise’. © Inter-Disciplinary Press 2012.","Grotesque; illusion; image; semiotics; visual arts","","","","","","","","Aristotle, Poetics, (1995); Artaud A., The Theatre and Its Double, (1992); Bablet D., Jomaron J., History of Contemporary Theatre Direction, 12, (2008); Fischer-Lichte E., The Semiotics of Theatre, (1992); Lignadis T., The Animal and The Monster: The Function of Poetics and Acting in Ancient Greek Drama, (1988); Matejka L., Titunik I.R., Semiotics of Art: Prague School Contributions, (1984); Matteo Di P., In Front of the Masterpiece, Programmes of the Performances ‘Inferno’, ‘Purgatorio’, ‘Paradiso’, (2008); Papalexiou E., [When Words Turn to Matter]: Romeo Castellucci- Societas Rafaello Sanzio, (2009); Puchner W., Semiotics of the Theatre, (1985); Read A., Romeo Castellucci: The Director on this Earth, Contemporary European Theatre Directors, (2010); Thomson P., The Grotesque, (1984); Varopoulou E., The Living Theatre: Essay on the Contemporary Stage, (2002)","","","Brill","","","","","","","978-184888066-5","","","English","The Visual in Performance Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119275407"

Through an analysis of some of their works, this article focuses on some spatio-temporal images, actions and metaphors related to movement (crossing, walking through, passing borders). Then it questions the exploration of narratives in visual arts, especially the relationship between imaginary fiction and reality stories. Theatre may become the very place where contemporary tales of migrant people are translated, (re)told, performed. The very meaningful notion of hospitality becomes a theatrical practice in one of the most relevant spectacles of the Théâtre du Soleil, Le Dernier Caravansérail (Odyssées) (2003). Another aspect of this creative hospitality - Leïla Sebbar's Mes Algéries en France - concerns the interweaving of memories belonging to opposite sides of divided countries, after the colonial wars. This work of collection, transcription, translation from one to another gives an example of writing (as fiction and narrative) as a repairing work but also of revelation of unknown connections. © The Author(s), 2009.","Contemporary fiction; Hospitality; Migrant writers; Postcolonial memories; Temporality; Theatre; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Barakat H., Le Laboureur des eaux, (1999); Bhabha H., The Location of Culture, (1994); Derrida J., Anne D., De l'hospitalité, (1997); Emil Abboud J., Smuggling Lemons, (2007); Sebbar L., Mes Algéries en France, (2004); Sebbar L., Journal de mes Algéries en France, (2005); Sebbar L., Voyage en Algéries autour de ma chambre, (2008); Le Dernier Caravansérail (Odyssées), programme de toutes les odyssées, (2003)","N.

Not only could we explain which forms of theatre have emerged and are still emerging, ie what we see, but also the character of the actions that led to, or are precipitating them. In other words we could describe and analyse the types of acting and methods of staging, ie how they have arisen. Therefore this article offers one possible, systematic way in which to describe the passage from everyday life to theatrical events, with the help of Johan Huizinga's game theory. Huizinga differentiates between the consequences of actions and the emphasis of those actions. He defines more complex forms of play as 'a contest for something or a representation of something'. This definition can be used as the basis for a diagrammatic representation of the field of scenic sequences. In contradistinction to some performance theories, the value of the coordinate system lies in its realistic boundaries: those of absolute play, image and death. For this reason the coordinate system is a theoretical tool that can be used to compare scenic sequences in different historical and contemporary situations. This will be undertaken by means of a 'field experiment' that tries to display how phenomena, both of life processes and of theatre forms, can be differentiated within a playing culture. Finally the article demonstrates that scenic sequences can be transformed into medial sequences and how medial sequences can be completely digitally manufactured. In both cases the face-to-face situation disappears. © 2014 Brill.

Alongside the complex of techniques and the worldwide influence it has on contemporary performing art, was there a special area that the master perceived incomplete? Could this be connected to authoritarian theatre-making (which has been recently acknowledged in the field), where the relationship in the actor-director dyad remains hierarchical and evokes a continuous conflict (as a manifestation of stage fright) between them? I argue that on Stanislavski’s personal path as an actor from stage fright to self-confidence, alongside the practical exercises which he designed according to Yoga, he also perceived the importance of Vedic philosophy itself to the performing arts. Via application of Stanislavskian craft, one can experience the absolute truth and higher consciousness, which could replace the internal and external confrontation with fruitful creative outcomes in a rehearsal studio–if practiced perfectly. Unfortunately, the methodology to support the philosophical (ethical) side of the system remained undeveloped by him when he passed away. Zero Zone unique psychosomatic praxis is designed according to Yogic Abhyasa and Vairagya principles to enhance the exchange between actor and director in the creative process to reach the higher aims, described already by Stanislavski. The current paper supports writings on the spiritual aspect of the Stanislavskian system, self-cultivation practices in performing arts and executive coaching. © 2022 The Author(s).

In this article, we describe the impetus and outcomes for collective art-making within our group of seven health researchers. Methods: As a group, we represent sociology, psychology, nursing, occupational therapy, and kinesiology, as well as interdisciplinary studies. Guided by a professional artist, we engaged with mixed media to explore our experiences as psychosocial cancer researchers. Results: Findings are brought to light through a process and outcome narrative that highlights the meaningfulness of cancer to researchers. Conclusions: Key learnings could inform initiatives that other health researchers might undertake if choosing to expand beyond prevalent models of art as intervention for those who are ill to more fully engage those who explore such lines of inquiry. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","breast cancer;

The author was interested in relations existing between beliefs and their iconographic representation. Changes of the imagery of the damned in historical context portrayed in the Last Judgment icons painted in selected Orthodox churches in Romania came under the investigation of the author. Romanian icon painters using Byzantine characteristics of representation introduced some significant modifications into the canon. We can divide icons of the Last Judgment into two groups - on the one hand we see sinners who rebelled against the moral canon of Christianity, on the other there are some nations unknown to Romanians, foreign people of various nationalities and faiths that can be grouped into a few categories. The largest of them is composed of pagans (Turks, Tartars and Arabs), infidels (Jews) and heretics (Armenians and Latin rite Catholics). With time this tradition turned into customary painting of the Last Judgment icons in Romania. It disappeared in the 20th century, only to be reborn with the fall of the communist era in new historical contexts. Old enemies of the Orthodox were replaced by new ones, the representatives of the greatest totalitarian systems in the 20th century - fascists, Nazis, communists; terrorists - the Muslims and their leader (Bin Laden) as well as contemporary Romanian politicians, who are being eternalized in the Last Judgment icons on the walls of Orthodox churches. © SACRI.","Canonical and apocryphal texts; Eschatological beliefs; Iconographic canon; Orthodox art, Romania; Stereotypes; The damned; The icons of the last judgment; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Balan I., Sfintele Icoane Fǎcǎtoare De Minuni Din România, (1999); Babos A., Tracing a Sacred Building Tradition, Wooden Churches, Carpenters and Founders In Maramureş Until the Turn of the 18th Century, (2004); Bals G., Bisericile Lui Ştefan Cel Mare, (1926); Bals G., Bisericile Şi Mǎnǎstirile Moldoveneşti Din Veacul Al XVI-lea, (1928); Betea R., Tîmpla Bisericii De Lemn Din Deseşti; Bud T., Date Istorice Despre Protopopiatele, Parohiile şi Mǎnǎstirile Române Din Maramureş Din Timpurile Vechi şi Pânǎ În Anul 1911, (1911); Bichir F., Timişoara: Bin Laden pictat în Capela Armatei sub chip de drac!, Lumea Credinţei, Octombrie, 10, 27, (2005); Bobrinskoy B., Życie Liturgiczne, (2004); Bud T., Date Istorice Despre Protopopiatele, Parohiile şi Mǎnǎstirile Române Din Maramureş Din Timpurile Vechi şi Pânǎ În Anul 1911, (1911); Cormack R., Malowanie Duszy.

But while research has focused on ACGB's contribution to English cultural life, little has been written about its influence throughout the rest of Great Britain. This paper addresses this gap by examining ACGB's Welsh Committee's contribution to the visual arts in post-war Wales.

Setup following a special conference between the Board of Education and the Pilgrim Trust, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) aimed to boost wartime morale by sponsoring local arts groups facing financial difficulties because of the war and by organising its own nationwide programme of plays, concerts and exhibitions.5 According to Hewison, this ‘mark[ed] the beginning of the modern period in official British cultural policy’.6","ACGB Annual Report 1952-53, (1953); ACGB Annual Report 1955-56, (1956); ACGB Annual Report 1964-65, (1965); Bell D., The Art of Josef Herman, The Welsh Review, 7, 2, pp. 107-109, (1948); Bell D., Contemporary Welsh Painting, The Welsh Anvil, 3, pp. 17-28, (1951); Bell D., Foreword to South Wales Group: First Annual Exhibition, (1949); Bell D., The Artist in Wales, (1957); Black L., Making Britain a Gayer More Cultivated Society"": Wilson, Lee and the Creative Industries in the 1960s, Contemporary British History, 20, 3, pp. 323-342, (2006); Bohana R., The Welsh Committee of the Arts Council in the 1960s, Education, Culture and Society: Some Perspectives on the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, (1991); Bourdieu P., Darbel A., The Love of Art: European Art Museums and Their Public, (1990); Cleaver W., Contemporary Art Society for Wales: 50th Anniversary Exhibition, (1987); A Policy for the Arts-The First Steps, (1965); Report on the Arts in Wales, (1966); Curtis T., Welsh Painters Talking, (1997); Davies J., Broadcasting and the BBC in Wales, (1994); Dowding W., Music and Art Clubs: What Are They?, Wales, 23, pp. 42-44, (1946); Galloway S., Jones H.D., Scottish Dimension of British Arts Governance: A Historical Perspective, Cultural Trends, 19, 1-2, pp. 24-40, (2010); Gray C., Politics of the Arts in Britain, (2000); Greenberg C., Modernist Painting, Reprinted in Art in Modern Culture: An Anthology of Critical Texts, (1992); Harvey J., Art of Piety: The Visual Culture of Welsh Nonconformity, (1995); Herman N., Josef Herman: A Working Life, (1996); Hewison R., Culture and Consensus: England, Art and Politics since 1940, (1997); Humphreys R., Images of Wales, Post-War Wales, (1995); Johnes M., Wales, History and Britishness, Welsh Historical Review, 25, 4, pp. 596-619, (2011); Jones H.D., War Declared, Planet: The Welsh Internationalist, 198, pp. 47-56, (2009); Keating M., Plurinational Democracy: Stateless Nations in a Post-Sovereignty Era, (2001); Keynes J.M., Arts Council: Its Policy and Hopes, Reprinted in ACGB Annual Report 1945-46, (1946); Leventhal F.M., Best for the Most"": CEMA and State Sponsorship of the Arts in Wartime, 1939-1945, Twentieth Century British History, 1, 3, pp. 289-317, (1990); Lord P., Aesthetics of Relevance, (1993); Lord P., The Visual Culture of Wales: Industrial Society, (1998); Lord P., The Visual Culture of Wales: Imaging the Nation, (2000); Marwick A., British Society since 1945, (2003); Minihan J., Nationalization of Culture: The Development of State Subsidies in the Arts in Great Britain, (1977); Morgan K.O., Wales: Rebirth of a Nation 1880-1980, (1982); Piercy J., The Atrocities Over There, Planet: The Welsh Internationalist, 126, pp. 90-91, (1997); Roberts H., Howard Roberts Gallery, Anglo-Welsh Review, 41, pp. 169-174, (1969); Roms, Heike.

Our research context comprises attendance at the live and recorded performing arts in a large metropolitan city located in a Western country in which the dominant language is English. The research methods comprise long interviews with, and observations of, a sample of 36 performing arts patrons who had attended a classical music concert at least once: specifically, 18 low CC and 18 high CC. Analysis suggests several advances on previous research. Specific subsets of consumption values linked to CC in the prior literature, associate with LCC or HCC. These consumption values can be viewed as macro-values, which associate with numerous micro-values. Additional consumption values worthy of additional exploration emerged from data analysis. Consumption portfolios identified in prior research, are confirmed as associating with CC. © 2018 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.","Consumption portfolios; consumption values, cultural capital; emic interpretations; performing arts","","","","","","","","Abercrombie N., Television and society, (1996); Report on classical music attendees, (2002); Austin B.A., Portrait of an art film audience, Journal of Communication, 34, 1, pp. 74-87, (1984); Austin J.T., Vancouver J.B., Goal constructs in psychology: Structure, process, and content, Psychological Bulletin, 120, 3, pp. 338-375, (1996); Bettman J., Luce M.F., Payne J.W., Constructive consumer choice processes, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 3, pp. 187-217, (1998); Bourdieu P., Cultural reproduction and social reproduction, Power and ideology in education, pp. 487-511, (1977); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A social critique of the judgement of taste, (1984); Caldwell M., Woodside A.G., The role of cultural capital in performing arts patronage, International Journal of Arts Management, 5, pp. 34-50, (2003); Coleman R.P., The continuing significance of social class to marketing, Journal of Consumer Research, 10, 3, pp. 265-280, (1983); Collana C.M., The impact of public funding on cultural urban revitalization, Journal of Business and Economic Research, 1, 3, pp. 1-8, (2010); Deighton J., The consumption of performance, Journal of Consumer Research, 19, 3, pp. 362-373, (1992); Dimaggio P.M., Useem M., Brown P., Audience studies of the performing arts and museums, (1978); Gainer B., Ritual and relationships: Interpersonal influences on shared consumption, Journal of Business Research, 32, 3, pp. 253-260, (1995); Henry P., Modes of thought that vary systematically with both social class and age, Psychology & Marketing, 17, 5, pp. 421-440, (2000); Holt D.B., How do consumers consume: A typology of consumption practices, Journal of Consumer Research, 22, 1, pp. 1-16, (1995); Holt D., Does cultural capital structure American consumption?, Journal of Consumer Research, 25, 1, pp. 1-25, (1998); Hofstede G., Culture’s consequences: International differences in work related values, (1980); Hume M., Sullivan Mort G.S., Liesch P.W., Winzar H., Understanding service experience in non-profit performing arts: Implications for operations and service management, Journal of Operations Management, 24, 4, pp. 304-324, (2006); Kotler P., Scheff J., Standing room only, strategies for marketing the performing arts, (1997); Lamont M., Money, morals and manners: The culture of the French and American upper-middle class, (1992); Levy S., Arts consumers and aesthetic attributes, Marketing the arts, pp. 29-46, (1980); McCracken G., The long interview, (1988); Miles M.B., Huberman M.A., Qualitative data analysis: An expanded sourcebook, (1994); Peterson R., Simkus A., How musical tastes mark occupational status groups, Cultivating differences: Symbolic boundaries and the making of inequality, pp. 900-907, (1992); Peterson R.A., Kern R.M., Changing highbrow taste: From snob to omnivore, American Sociological Review, 61, 5, pp. 900-907, (1996); Peterson R.A., Problems in comparative research: The example of omnivorousness, Poetics, 33, 5-6, pp. 257-282, (2005); Quine M., Theatre audiences in Britain: A continuing research program, The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society, 23, 3, pp. 225-239, (1993); Radbourne J., Johanson K., Glow H., White T., The audience experience: Measuring quality in the performing arts, International Journal of Arts Management, pp. 16-29, (2009); Thompson C.J., Troester M., Consumer value systems on the age of post-modern fragmentation: The case of natural health micro-culture, Journal of Consumer Research, 28, 4, pp. 550-571, (2002); Veblen T., The theory of the leisure class, (1970); Weber M., “Class, Status and Party”, from Weber: Essays in Sociology, (1946); Weiner B., Human motivation: Metaphors, theories, and research, (1992); Wolfinbarger M., Gilly M.C., Shopping online for freedom, control and fun, California Management Review, 43, 2, pp. 34-55, (2001)","M.

This common perception is actually a product of romanticism, and it fails to give full attention to the variety of factors that motivate the creation and performance of art. The language of vocation offers an alternative to accounts that focus exclusively on self-expression, encouraging students to think about how their artistic energies can be shaped in ways that are faithful to, and in the service of, their audiences. Instead of creating and performing art for the purpose of eliciting strong emotional responses, artists can think in more focused ways about the meaning and context of their art-making, and consider the degree to which it functions as a response to the material order. An approach focused on vocation can liberate artists, as well as their audiences. © Oxford University Press 2017.

The author examines the transmission of knowledge through the connection between the artist and his/her material, which involves the development of techniques and the rider's ""feel.""

Monte Alegre, 984 – Perdizes, SP, São Paulo, 05014-901, Brazil","This article reflects upon the relationship between body and costume in the charac-ter ‘Woman from the Past’ in the production Life and Times of Carlos & Carlos directed by Emílio Di Biasi in 1987 in São Paulo, Brazil. Drawing on the account of the performer Gaby Imparato about her scenic dress, I investigate the dynamics of body–costume relationship based on Bodymedia Theory, which reassesses the concept of body concerning design processes and practices in the production of scenic costumes and in the costume design research literature. The theory provides tools to discuss costumes and bodies intertwined in a co-defined relationship while onstage, inviting us to rethink predetermined resources in costume production. The performer’s account helps to verify how the costume designer’s intentions and stimuli offered to the body onstage, predefined in the costume design, find other paths to developing scenic actions. This proposition allows me to discuss the relationship between body and costume onstage when understood as an articulator of perception and action. Thus, I can enunciate costume as an activator of bodily actions in rehearsals and on the scene. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

The editor Pablo Fossa suggests viewing inner speech as a private area to remember, play and dream, rather than a mere psychological function connected to problem solving. Along the lines of this suggestion, I adopt a playful approach in order to review the volume. Rather than delivering results of an analysis, I invite us to use the academic journal platform to take part in a dialogical encounter. In the first part of this essay, I offer a transparent step-by-step process of researcher's positioning, based on remembering and playing. In the second part, I dream of research methodologies, which would allow us to explore inner speech as dynamic movements experienced by whole and dialogical beings. This experiment, in which I enact my inner speech on the academic stage, eventually lets three key-moments of Fossa's book come forward as gamechangers for future inquiries: 1. The importance of hearing one's voice in audio-diary based research, 2. the shift of attention towards experiential contexts of inner speech (such as bodily sensations or felt knowledge), and 3. the notion of thirdness as a meta-position, pointing at the mutual permeability of reflective and pre-reflective realms of inner speech. This performing review is inspired by a theatre-based practice called Dialogical Acting with the Inner Partners and represents an original contribution to researcher's self-reflexive positioning practices, as well as to inner speech qualitative research methodologies. © 2023, The Author(s).","Dialogical Acting; Inner Speech; Performing Arts; Phenomenology; Play; Public Solitude","Emotions; Humans; Speech; article; attention; dream; hearing; human; human experiment; inner speech; memory; performing arts; phenomenology; qualitative research; social isolation; voice; emotion; speech","","","","","Université de Neuchâtel, UniNE","","Alderson-Day B., Fernyhough C., Inner speech: Development, cognitive functions, phenomenology, and neurobiology, Psychological Bulletin, 141, 5, pp. 931-965, (2015); Alderson-Day B., Mitrenga K., Wilkinson S., McCarthy-Jones S., Fernyhough C., The varieties of inner speech questionnaire – Revised (VISQ-R): Replicating and refining links between inner speech and psychopathology, Consciousness and Cognition, 65, pp. 48-58, (2018); Matthews G.B., On the Trinity, (2002); Bakhtin M.M., Holquist M., Emerson C., Speech genres and other late essays (1st ed), (1986); Bitbol M., Petitmengin C., Neurophenomenology and the micro-phenomenological interview, The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness, pp. 726-739, (2017); Bragg M., Augustine’s Confessions, In Our Time.

Art is often classified by school leaders, students, parents and even teachers as different from other subjects; sometimes viewed as almost magical, enabling students to explore and develop an innate creativity; sometimes simply unimportant, a therapeutic respite from the more demanding academic subjects. In this article, I trace the problematic relationship between visual arts and educational knowledge. I propose that this dynamic prevents the function of robust assessment systems and constrains equal access. I investigate how my subject has been thus marginalised, with reference to curriculum and policy documents that influence my immediate situation, and turn to the work of educational sociologist Basil Bernstein and his followers, to define the problem and plot a possible future for art education. Bernstein’s model of the pedagogic device, his work on the recontextualisation of knowledge and his concept of pedagogic rights assist me in formulating a case for an articulated conceptual grammar in visual arts education. © 2021 The Authors.

The respondents were presented with pictures of two artworks, The Persistence of Memory (1931) by Salvador Dalí and Which Link Fails First? (1992) by Teemu Mäki, a Finnish contemporary artist. They were asked to comment and compare the two pictures and tell which one they liked better. The respondents' spontaneous comments show different aspects of how an artwork is perceived and evaluated. The interviews were analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. As the result of in vivo coding, 40 variables were created for use in a content analysis. The respondents focused on different things when evaluating the two artworks. When commenting Dalí's painting, they paid attention on its affective and sensory characteristics, while Mäki's work was discussed primarily in terms of its message and perceived lack of professional quality. In parallel, a selection of interviews was analysed in order to reveal the temporal sequence of discussing and evaluating different aspects of the paintings. The analysis showed three ways of discussing, which were called naïve, scholarly, and deliberative. The temporally structured model of aesthetic appreciation and judgement suggested in 2004 by Leder and his co-workers was used as a heuristic device for an analysis of the shifts of attention that take place when a discourse is created and anchored in perception. Both cognitive psychology and phenomenological sociology emphasize the dependence of perception on context and intention; there is reason to take that theoretical starting point seriously. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","aesthetic evaluation; aesthetic perception; context; interviews; temporal sequence; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Augustin M.D., Leder H., Hutzler F., Carbon C.-C., Style follows content: On the microgenesis of art perception, Acta Psychol, 128, pp. 127-138, (2008); Funch B.S., The Psychology of Art Appreciation, Museum Tusculanum Press, (1997); Funch B.S., Hvorfor ser VI på billedkonst?, Nordisk Museologi, 1, pp. 87-96, (2000); Hanquinet L., Mondrian as kitchen tiles?

This chapter explores what precisely is the qualitative and material character of things and by what means could one gain access to this concealed character. In the 1920s things appear as an object of explicitly political attention. Even an abbreviated array of concerns about things and the human relation to them can provide a different perspective on the most familiar modernist texts. The premodern or nonmodern object becomes a focus within narrative prose fiction, just as ""primitive"" objects came to rejuvenate the visual and plastic arts of the West. The modernist poet, whether addressing natural or technological objects, feels the need to rescue them not from consumer culture so much as from rationalism, symbolism, and language itself. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Limited.","Language; Material culture; Materialism; Matter; Modernism; Modernist texts; Objects; Plastic arts; Things; Visual arts","","","","","","","","Adorno T., Lyric Poetry and Society,"" trans Bruce Mayo., In Critical Theory and Society, pp. 155-171, (1989); Adorno T., The Handle, the Pot, and Early Experience, Notes to Literature, 2, (1992); Arendt H., Stern G., Rilke's Duino Elegies, Reflections on Literature and Culture, pp. 1-23, (2007); Arvatov B., Everyday Life and the Culture of the Thing (Toward the Formulation of the Question), trans Christina Kiaer, pp. 119-128, (1996); Asendorf C., Batteries of Life: On the History of Things and Their Perception in Modernity, trans, (1993); Benjamin W., One-Way Street, trans, (1996); Benjamin W., Surrealism: The Last Snapshot of the European Intelligentsia, trans Edmond Jephcott, In Selected Writings: Volume 2: 1927-1934, pp. 207-221, (1999); Bergson H., An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans, (2007); Bergson H., Creative Evolution, trans, (1998); Bewes T., Reification, or the Anxiety of Late Capitalism, (2002); Bloch E., The Spirit of Utopia, trans, (2000); Bowen E., The Last September, (2000); Brown B., The Secret Life of Things (Virginia Woolf and the Matter of Modernism), Modernism/ Modernity, 6, 2, pp. 1-28, (1999); Brown B., A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature, (2003); Brown B., Things, (2004); Burstein J., Cold Modernism: Literature, Fashion, Art, (2012); Cather W., The Professor's House, (1925); Cather W., The Novel Démeublé., Not Under Forty, pp. 43-51, (1936); Cather W., The Song of the Lark, (1999); Corn W., The Great American Thing: Modern Art and National Identity, 1915-1935, (1999); Crane H., The Bridge, (1992); Danius S., The Senses of Modernism: Technology, Perception, Aesthetics, (2002); Davidson M., Ghostlier Demarcations: Modern Poetry and the Material Word, (1997); Drucker J., The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923, (1997); Flam J., Deutch M., Primitivism and Twentieth-Century Art: A Documentary History, (2003); Foster H., Prosthetic Gods, (2004); Fry R., Preface to the Omega Workshops Catalog, In A Roger Fry Reader, (1996); Heidegger M., Being and Time, trans, (1962); Heidegger M., The Origin of the Work of Art, In Poetry, Language, Thought, pp. 15-86, (2001); Heidegger M., The Thing., In Poetry, Language, Thought, pp. 161-184, (2001); Honneth A., Reification: A New Look at an Old Idea, (2008); Joyce J., Ulysses, ed, (1986); Judd D., Specific Objects.""

Performance artists grapple with disturbing shared experiences neither they, nor their cultural consociates, can get into words, but that artists render through a play of figures. By reframing figures and the cultural models they symbolise, artists think and feel through cultural memories in ways that germinate social, psychological, and artistic change. This capacity is particularly useful in historical periods of abrupt transition, as the colonial era was in the Pacific. The performances I review are wonderfully coordinated, collective endeavours in which players and audience together, within the quotation marks of play, consider interactions between foreign males and local females and their implications for models of race and gender. © 2010 Discipline of Anthropology and Sociology.","Gender; History; Performing arts; Race; Samoa","","","","","","","","Poetics.

Employing their definition of a knowledge-centric arts organization, the authors conduct an exploratory quantitative study of 368 small and mid-sized non-profit performing arts organizations in the United States using primary data on 36 organizational practices and secondary data on 21 performance metrics. Analysis of these two data sources independently suggests a gap between organizations' practices and their performance. Statistical analyses using factor analysis and linear regression identify seven distinct performance metrics that are positively associated with knowledge-centric practices. These findings can serve as a basis for investigation of how organizations can be sustainable and operate effectively in a knowledge-driven society.","knowledge management; Knowledge-centricity; organizational performance; organizational practices; performing arts","","","","","","","","Abfalter D., Stadler R., Muller J., The organization of knowledge sharing at the Colorado Music Festival, International Journal of Arts Management, 14, 3, pp. 4-15, (2012); Bass B.M., From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision, Organizational Dynamics, 18, 3, pp. 19-31, (1991); Bowman E.H., Helfat C.E., Does corporate strategy matter?, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 1, pp. 1-23, (2001); Bowsher C., Total quality management in museums: An investigation into the adaptive relevance of TQM in the museums sector, Management in Museums, pp. 233-263, (1999); Camarero C., Garrido M., The influence of market and product orientation on museum performance, International Journal of Arts Management, 10, 2, pp. 14-26, (2008); Camarero C., Garrido M., The role of technological and organizational innovation in the relation between market orientation and performance in cultural organizations, European Journal of Innovation Management, 11, 3, pp. 413-434, (2008); Carnochan S., Samples M Myers M., Austin M.J., Performance measurement challenges in nonprofit human service organizations, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 43, 6, pp. 1014-1032, (2014); Crawford K., Hasan L Warne H., Linger H., From traditional knowledge management in hierarchical organizations to a network centric paradigm for a changing world, Emergence: Complexity and Organization, 11, 1, pp. 1-18, (2009); Finkelstein S., Hambrick D.C., Top management team tenure and organizational outcomes: The moderating role of managerial discretion, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 3, pp. 484-503, (1990); Forbes D.P., Measuring the unmeasurable: Empirical studies of nonprofit organization effectiveness from 1977 to 1997, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 27, 2, pp. 183-202, (1998); Gainer B., Padanyi P., Applying the marketing concept to cultural organisations: An empirical study of the relationship between market orientation and performance, International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, 7, 2, pp. 182-193, (2002); Gilhespy I., Measuring the performance of cultural organizations: A model, International Journal of Arts Management, 2, 1, pp. 38-52, (1999); Gilhespy I., The evaluation of social objectives in cultural organizations, International Journal of Arts Management, 4, 1, pp. 48-57, (2001); Grant R.M., Toward a knowledge-based theory of the firm, Strategic Management Journal, 17, 2 S, pp. 109-122, (1996); Portfolio 2006, (2006); Portfolio 2011, (2011); Portfolio 2014, (2014); Hsieh M.H., Human-centric knowledge seeking strategies: A stakeholder perspective, Journal of Knowledge Management, 13, 4, pp. 115-133, (2009); Jackson P.M., Promises and pitfalls, Museum Economics and the Community, pp. 41-65, (1991); Jamieson S., Likert scales: How to (ab)use them, Medical Education, 38, 12, pp. 1217-1218, (2004); Janardhan D., Vakharia N., Towards a knowledge-centric arts organization, American Journal of Arts Management, (2014); Kamberg M., The knowledge economy is here, Are You Ready?

The goal of this systematic review is to analyse those investigations related to the impact of visual arts interventions on the health and well-being of people with dementia. This review has been done using Medline, PsycINFO and Cinalh databases. Out of 84 publications found, 18 met the inclusion criteria. The results highlight the current relevance of research on visual arts intervention in dementia, but the studies included small samples and showed important methodological weaknesses. Nevertheless, current literature suggests that with adequate supports people with dementia can produce and appreciate visual art, and improve the perception of physical and emotional well-being. © 2018 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.All right reserved.","Alzheimer's disease; Art galleries; Art therapy; Dementia; Visual arts","","","","","","demencia en programas de artes visuales normalizados es potencialmente adecuada para promover la calidad de vida","Hasta no hace mucho, los programas de artes visuales dirigidos a personas con demencia se han basado fundamentalmente en modelos rehabilitadores que se centran, en gran medida, en reducir los déficits cognitivos, emocionales y comportamentales de las personas con demencia. En la actualidad, se propone un enfoque integrador, interactivo y holístico de la salud en el que se incorporan los componentes sociales y contextuales en la intervención en las personas con demencia (Fernández-López, Fernández-Fidalgo, & Cieza, 2010; Organización Mundial de la Salud, 2001). Desde esta perspectiva, estudios que han aplicado programas de arte visuales desarrollados en entornos normalizados como las galerías de arte o museos han demostrado un efecto positivo en el bienestar y la satisfacción de las personas con demencia y la de sus cuidadores (Camic et al., 2015; Camic et al., 2014; Eekelaar et al., 2012; MacPherson et al., 2009; Young et al., 2015). Las futuras investigaciones deberían estar orientadas a analizar cómo la participación de las personas con demencia en programas de artes visuales normalizados es potencialmente adecuada para promover la calidad de vida, así como identificar aquellos aspectos positivos del ambiente que se pueden incentivar para incrementar la participación en actividades artísticas y mejorar los resultados de calidad de vida.","Camic P.M., Baker E.L., Tischler V., Theorizing how art gallery interventions Impact people with dementia and their caregivers, The Gerontologist, 56, 6, pp. 1033-1041, (2015); Camic P.M., Tischler V., Pearman C.H., Viewing and making art together: A multi-session art-gallery-based intervention for people with dementia and their carers, Aging & Mental Health, 18, 2, pp. 161-168, (2014); Chancellor B., Duncan A., Chatterjee A., Art therapy for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Journal of Alzheimer'S Disease, 39, 1, pp. 1-11, (2014); Cowl A.L., Gaugler J.E., Efficacy of creative arts therapy in treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia: A systematic literature review, Activities, Adaptation & Aging, 38, 4, pp. 281-330, (2014); De Pedrocuesta J., Virues-Ortega J., Vega S., Seijo-Martinez M., Saz P., Rodriguez F., Del Barrio J.L., Prevalence of dementia and major dementia subtypes in Spanish populations: A reanalysis of dementia prevalence surveys, 1990-2008, BMC Neurology, 9, 55, (2009); Eekelaar C., Camic P.M., Springham N., Art galleries, episodic memory and verbal fluency in dementia: An exploratory study, Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity and The Arts, 6, 3, pp. 262-272, (2012); Fernandez-Lopez J.A., Fernandez-Fidalgo M., Cieza A., Quality of life, health and well-being conceptualizations from the perspective of the International Classification of Functioning, disability and health (ICF)], Revista Española De Salud Pública, 84, 2, pp. 169-184, (2010); Fernandez-Rios L., Buela-Casal G., Standards for the preparation and writing of psychology review articles, International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, 9, 2, pp. 329-344, (2009); Halpern A.R., O'Connor M.G., Stability of ART preference in frontotemporal dementia, Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity and The Arts, 7, 1, pp. 95-99, (2013); Hattori H., Hattori C., Hokao C., Mizushima K., Mase T., Controlled study on the cognitive and psychological effect of coloring and drawing in mild Alzheimer's disease patients, Geriatrics & Gerontology International, 11, 4, pp. 431-437, (2011); Kinney J.M., Rentz C.A., Observed well-being among individuals with dementia: Memories in the Making©, an art program, versus other structured activity, American Journal of Alzheimer'S Disease and Other Dementias, 20, 4, pp. 220-227, (2005); Lawton M.P., Quality of life in Alzheimer disease, Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders, 8, 3, pp. 138-150, (1994); MacPherson S., Bird M., Anderson K., Davis T., Blair A., An art gallery access programme for people with dementia: 'you do it for the moment, Aging & Mental Health, 13, 5, pp. 744-752, (2009); Meguro M., Ishizaki J., Meguro K., Collage technique may provide new perspectives for Alzheimer patients by exploring messages from their inner world, Dementia & Neuropsychologia, 3, 4, pp. 299-302, (2009); Olazaran J., Reisberg B., Clare L., Cruz I., Pena-Casanova J., Del Ser T., Muniz R., Nonpharmacological therapies in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review of efficacy, Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 30, 2, pp. 161-178, (2010); CIE 10 Trastornos Mentales Y Del Comportamiento.

In nineteenth-century Italy, opera represented an important phenomenon, both artistically and socially, playing a fundamental role of intermediary between society and the political sphere. The complex relationships between the composer (artist) and the publisher (cultural intermediary) are analysed in the specific field of opera music, outlining the evolution and interweaving of artistic, social and economic aspects. The study embraces the period 1839–1893 and examines the economic and private relations between Giuseppe Verdi and Casa Ricordi and their impacts on the culture industry to this day. This article’s novelty is to adopt a historical perspective to broaden accounting into the field of high music offering possibilities for further studies. © The Author(s) 2021.","Casa Ricordi; copyright; cultural industry; Giuseppe Verdi; performing arts","","","","","","","","Faldone Q., Documenti Teatro La Scala, diritti di Autore, (1831); (1882); (1889); (1867); (1871); (1867); (1871); (1839); (1893); Ricordi Historical Archive, Letter Verdi-Ricordi, 31 January 1850, segnatura: LLET000703, (1850); Ricordi Historical Archive, Letter Verdi-Ricordi, 1 November 1851, segnatura: LLET000703, (1851); Ricordi Historical Archive, Letter Verdi-Ricordi, 2 February 1857, segnatura: LLET000745, (1857); (1892); National Academy of Lincei.

This dual perception directly influenced medieval iconography, in which he was represented as the summit of knowledge associated with Liberal Arts cycles or as the victim of apocryphal legends that linked him to the role of the senex amator-the lecherous old man mocked by a young woman-popular in theatrical tradition since the Roman period.
