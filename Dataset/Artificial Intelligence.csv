By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters. © Copyright 2015 by International Machine Learning Society (IMLS).

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a goldstandard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10–100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.

The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Image QA algorithms generally interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a ""reference"" or ""perfect"" image in some perceptual space. Such ""full-reference"" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by signal fidelity measures. In this paper, we approach the image QA problem as an information fidelity problem. Specifically, we propose to quantify the loss of image information to the distortion process and explore the relationship between image information and visual quality. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of ""natural"" images and videos that are meant for ""human consumption."" Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of such natural signals. Using these models, we previously presented an information fidelity criterion for image QA that related image quality with the amount of information shared between a reference and a distorted image. In this paper, we propose an image information measure that quantifies the information that is present in the reference image and how much of this reference information can be extracted from the distorted image. Combining these two quantities, we propose a visual information fidelity measure for image QA. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images and show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art image QA algorithms by a sizeable margin in our simulations. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at the LIVE website. © 2006 IEEE.","Image formation; Image quality assessment (QA); Information fidelity; Natural scene statistics (NSS)","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomimetics; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Image processing; Information theory; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Signal distortion; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; biomimetics; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Image information; Image quality assessment; Information fidelity; Natural scene statistics (NSS); Image quality","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF","Manuscript received December 13, 2003; revised March 8, 2005.

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.

We cast the recognition problem as one of classifying among multiple linear regression models and argue that new theory from sparse signal representation offers the key to addressing this problem. Based on a sparse representation computed by C1 -minimization, we propose a general classification algorithm for (image-based) object recognition. This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion.

Conventional approaches for modeling skeletons usually rely on hand-crafted parts or traversal rules, thus resulting in limited expressive power and difficulties of generalization. In this work, we propose a novel model of dynamic skeletons called Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN), which moves beyond the limitations of previous methods by automatically learning both the spatial and temporal patterns from data. This formulation not only leads to greater expressive power but also stronger generalization capability. On two large datasets, Kinetics and NTU-RGBD, it achieves substantial improvements over mainstream methods.

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this paper, we pursue a ""true"" two-dimensional transform that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure that is key in visual information. The main challenge in exploring geometry in images comes from the discrete nature of the data. Thus, unlike other approaches, such as curvelets, that first develop a transform in the continuous domain and then discretize for sampled data, our approach starts with a discrete-domain construction and then studies its convergence to an expansion in the continuous domain. Specifically, we construct a discrete-domain multiresolution and multidirection expansion using nonseparable filter banks, in much the same way that wavelets were derived from filter banks. This construction results in a flexible multiresolution, local, and directional image expansion using contour segments, and, thus, it is named the contourlet transform. The discrete contourlet transform has a fast iterated filter bank algorithm that requires an order N operations for N-pixel images. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between the developed filter bank and the associated continuous-domain contourlet expansion via a directional multiresolution analysis framework. We show that with parabolic scaling and sufficient directional vanishing moments, contourlets achieve the optimal approximation rate for piecewise smooth functions with discontinuities along twice continuously differentiable curves. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of contourlets in several image processing applications. © 2005 IEEE.","Contourlets; Contours; Filter banks; Geometric image processing; Multidirection; Multiresolution; Sparse representation; Wavelets","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Approximation theory; Computational geometry; Fourier transforms; Image analysis; Image quality; Image segmentation; Information theory; Wavelet transforms; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; signal processing; Contourlet transform; Directional multiresolution; Filter banks; Geometric image processing; Image representation; Multiresolution analysis; Sparse representation; Image compression","","","","","U.S. National Science Foundation, (CCR-0237633); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (20–63664.00)","Manuscript received October 21, 2003; revised August 17, 2005.

However, imperfections in the training phase of deep neural networks make them vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted by adversaries with the intent of causing deep neural networks to misclassify. In this work, we formalize the space of adversaries against deep neural networks (DNNs) and introduce a novel class of algorithms to craft adversarial samples based on a precise understanding of the mapping between inputs and outputs of DNNs. In an application to computer vision, we show that our algorithms can reliably produce samples correctly classified by human subjects but misclassified in specific targets by a DNN with a 97% adversarial success rate while only modifying on average 4.02% of the input features per sample. We then evaluate the vulnerability of different sample classes to adversarial perturbations by defining a hardness measure. Finally, we describe preliminary work outlining defenses against adversarial samples by defining a predictive measure of distance between a benign input and a target classification. © 2016 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Computationally efficient; Deep neural networks; Hardness measures; Input features; Large datasets; Target Classification; Training algorithms; Training phase; Computer vision","","","","","","","Barreno M., Nelson B., Joseph A.D., Tygar J., The security of machine learning, Machine Learning, 81, 2, pp. 121-148, (2010); Barreno M., Nelson B., Sears R., Joseph A.D., Tygar J.D., Can machine learning be secure, Proceedings of the 2006 ACMSymposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security, pp. 16-25, (2006); Bengio Y., Learning deep architectures for AI, Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning, 2, 1, pp. 1-127, (2009); Bergstra J., Breuleux O., Bastien F., Lamblin P., Pascanu R., Desjardins G., Turian J., Warde-Farley D., Bengio Y., Theano: A CPU and GPU math expression compiler, Proceedings of the Python for Scientific Computing Conference (SciPy, 4, (2010); Biggio B., Corona I., Maiorca D., Nelson B., Srndic N., Laskov P., Giacinto G., Roli F., Evasion attacks against machine learning at test time, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 387-402, (2013); Biggio B., Fumera G., Roli F., Pattern recognition systems under attack: Design issues and research challenges, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 28, 7, (2014); Biggio B., Fumera G., Roli F., Security evaluation of pattern classifiers under attack, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 26, 4, pp. 984-996, (2014); Biggio B., Nelson B., Laskov P., Support vector machines under adversarial label noise, ACML, pp. 97-112, (2011); Biggio B., Nelson B., Pavel L., Poisoning attacks against support vector machines, Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning, (2012); Biggio B., Rieck K., Ariu D., Wressnegger C., Corona I., Giacinto G., Roli F., Poisoning behavioral malware clustering, Proceedings of the 2014 Workshop on Artificial Intelligent and Security Workshop, pp. 27-36, (2014); Ciresan D., Meier U., Masci J., Et al., Multi-column deep neural network for traffic sign classification, Neural Networks, 32, pp. 333-338, (2012); Collobert R., Weston J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with task learning, Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 160-167, (2008); Dahl G.E., Stokes J.W., Deng L., Yu D., Large-scale malware classification using random projections and neural networks, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP, pp. 3422-3426, (2013); Dahl G.E., Yu D., Et al., Context-dependent pre-Trained deep neural networks for large-vocabulary speech recognition, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 20, 1, pp. 30-42, (2012); Fogla P., Lee W., Evading network anomaly detection systems: Formal reasoning and practical techniques, Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 59-68, (2006); Goodfellow I., Pouget-Abadie J., Mirza M., Xu B., Warde-Farley D., Ozair S., Et al., Generative adversarial nets, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2672-2680, (2014); Goodfellow I.J., Shlens J., Szegedy C., Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Learning Representations.

Box 969, United States","An approach to the construction of classifiers from unbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ""normal"" examples with only a small percentage of ""abnormal"" or ""interesting"" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy. © 2002 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples. © 2000 IEEE.","","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive systems; Artificial intelligence; Bandpass filters; Bearings (machine parts); Complex networks; Extended Kalman filters; Kalman filters; Learning systems; Nonlinear filtering; Nonlinear systems; Signal processing; Deterministic sampling approach; Gaussian random variable; Machine learning problem; Non-linear estimation; State distributions; Sub-optimal performance; Taylor series expansions; Unscented Kalman Filter; Nonlinear analysis","","","","","National Sleep Foundation, NSF, (IRI-9712346)","This work was sponsored by the NSF under grant grant IRI-9712346","De Freitas J., Niranjan M., Gee A., Doucet A., Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Optimisation of Neural Network Models, (1998); Dempster A., Laird N.M., Rubin D., Maximum-likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, B39, pp. 1-38, (1977); Haykin S., Adaptive Filter Theory, (1996); Julier S.J., The Scaled Unscented Transformation, (2000); Julier S.J., Uhlmann J.K., A New Extension of the Kalman Filter to Nonlinear Systems, Proc. of AeroSense: The 11th Int.

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","autoencoder; Boltzmann machine; Deep learning; feature learning; neural nets; representation learning; unsupervised learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Learning systems; Neural networks; Unsupervised learning; Auto encoders; Boltzmann machines; Deep learning; Feature learning; representation learning; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; human; review; artificial intelligence; trends; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Alain G., Bengio Y., What Regularized Auto-Encoders Learn from the Data Generating Distribution, (2012); Amari S.-I., Natural gradient works efficiently in learning, Neural Computation, 10, 2, pp. 251-276, (1998); Bach F., Jenatton R., Mairal J., Obozinski G., Structured sparsity through convex optimization, Statistical Science, 27, pp. 450-468, (2012); Bagnell J.A., Bradley D.M., Differentiable sparse coding, Proc.

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification. © 2010 IEEE.","Dimensionality reduction; domain adaptation; Hilbert space embedding of distributions; transfer learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Automatic Data Processing; Computer Simulation; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Transfer (Psychology); Classification (of information); Hilbert spaces; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Text processing; Component analysis; Cross-domain; Data distribution; Data labels; Data properties; Data sets; Different domains; Dimensionality reduction; domain adaptation; Domain distribution; Feature representation; Label information; Large datasets; Learning methods; Real-world application; Regression model; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised learning; Standard machines; Target domain; Text classification; transfer learning; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; computer simulation; information processing; learning; methodology; standard; Feature extraction","","","","","Hong Kong Research Grants Council/National Natural Science fund, (NHKUST 624/09); Singapore Nanyang Technological University, (RG15/08); State Emergency Response Commission, (102 1580034, 615209)","Manuscript received January 15, 2010; revised October 14, 2010; accepted October 31, 2010.

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function τ (G,n) ∈ Rm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities. © 2008 IEEE.","Graph neural networks (GNNs); Graph processing; Graphical domains; Recursive neural networks","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Databases, Factual; Internet; Linear Models; Neural Networks (Computer); Nonlinear Dynamics; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Biochemistry; Computer vision; Data processing; Image processing; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molecular biology; Pattern recognition; Recursive functions; Computational costs; Euclidean spaces; Generalization capabilities; Graph neural networks (GNNs); Graph processing; Graphical domains; Network methods; Network modelling; Recursive neural networks; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; comparative study; factual database; Internet; nonlinear system; regression analysis; reproducibility; statistical model; Neural networks","","","","","Appalachian Regional Commission, ARC, (DP0453089, LX045446); Australian Research Council, ARC","Manuscript received May 24, 2007; revised January 08, 2008 and May 02, 2008; accepted June 15, 2008.

We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments. Then we argue for the ""correctness"" or ""appropriateness"" of our theory with two strong arguments. The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of our theory of argumentation. The second argument illustrates how our theory can be used to investigate the logical structure of many practical problems. This argument is based on a result showing that our theory captures naturally the solutions of the theory of n-person games and of the well-known stable marriage problem. By showing that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure, we introduce a general logic-programming-based method for generating meta-interpreters for argumentation systems, a method very much similar to the compiler-compiler idea in conventional programming. © 1995.","Argumentation; Logic programming; n-person games; Nonmonotonic reasoning; The stable marriage problem","Formal logic; Game theory; Human engineering; Learning systems; Logic programming; Problem solving; Program compilers; Theorem proving; Argumentation systems; Logical structure; Meta-interpreters; N-person games; Nonmonotonic reasoning; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Imperial College Healthcare Charity; Fujitsu","This paper has been partially supported by the Abduction Group at the Imperial College under a grant from Fujitsu.

Radiomic artificial intelligence (AI) technology, either based on engineered hard-coded algorithms or deep learning methods, can be used to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers. However, lack of standardized algorithm definitions and image processing severely hampers reproducibility and comparability of results. To address this issue, we developed PyRadiomics, a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D Slicer. Here, we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and demonstrate its application in characterizing lung lesions. Source code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at www. radiomics.io. With this platform, we aim to establish a reference standard for radiomic analyses, provide a tested and maintained resource, and to grow the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.

In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of ""deep"" features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard back-propagation. Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.

These high-performing vision transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using a large infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce competitive convolution-free transformers trained on ImageNet only using a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop) on ImageNet with no external data. We also introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention, typically from a convnet teacher. The learned transformers are competitive (85.2% top-1 acc.) with the state of the art on ImageNet, and similarly when transferred to other tasks. We will share our code and models.

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [3], steerable filters [12], PCA-SIFT [19], differential invariants [20], spin images [21], SIFT [26], complex filters [37], moment invariants [43], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors. © 2005 IEEE.","Interest points; Interest regions; Invariance; Local descriptors; Matching; Recognition","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Software; Software Validation; Correlation methods; Edge detection; Feature extraction; Invariance; Mathematical transformations; Pattern matching; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer program; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; statistical analysis; statistical model; Interest points; Interest regions; Local descriptors; Pattern recognition systems","","","","","","","Ashbrook A., Thacker N., Rockett P., Brown C., Robust Recognition of Scaled Shapes Using Pairwise Geometric Histograms, Proc.

Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

We focus on two key issues: the problem of selecting relevant features, and the problem of selecting relevant examples. We describe the advances that have been made on these topics in both empirical and theoretical work in machine learning, and we present a general framework that we use to compare different methods. We close with some challenges for future work in this area. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Machine learning; Relevant examples; Relevant features","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data structures; Relevance reasoning; Learning systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (9357793); Alfred P.

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not overfit rapidly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.","","Adaptive boosting; Machine learning; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Bayesian; Data points; Ensemble methods; Error-correcting output coding; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Ali K.M., Pazzani M.J., Error reduction through learning multiple descriptions, Machine Learning, 24, 3, pp. 173-202, (1996); Bauer E., Kohavi R., An empirical comparison of voting classification algorithms: Bagging, boosting, and variants, Machine Learning, 36, 1-2, pp. 105-139, (1999); Blum A., Rivest R.L., Training a 3-node neural network is NP-complete (Extended abstract), Proceedings of the 1988 Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 9-18, (1988); Breiman L., Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Cherkauer K.J., Human expert-level performance on a scientific image analysis task by a system using combined artificial neural networks, Working Notes of the AAAI Workshop on Integrating Multiple Learned Models, pp. 15-21, (1996); Dietterich T.G., An experimental comparison of three methods for constructing ensembles of decision trees: Bagging, boosting, and randomization, Machine Learning, (2000); Dietterich T.G., Bakiri G., Solving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 2, pp. 263-286, (1995); Freund Y., Schapire R.E., A decision-theoretic generalization of on-line learning and an application to boosting, Tech.

However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with increasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the dataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this paper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which generalizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation scenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of different domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain discrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method for mean embedding matching. DAN can learn transferable features with statistical guarantees, and can scale linearly by unbiased estimate of kernel embedding. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed architecture yields state-of-the-art image classification error rates on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.","","Artificial intelligence; Image classification;

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: Speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ≈15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment. © 2012 IEEE.","Functional ANalysis Of VAriance (fANOVA); long short-term memory (LSTM); random search; recurrent neural networks; sequence learning","Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Computer music; Learning systems; Network architecture; Speech recognition; Activation functions; Computational components; Critical component; Handwriting recognition; Large-scale analysis; Long short term memory; Machine learning problem; Polyphonic music; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (270247, 317662)","","Hochreiter S., Untersuchungen zu Dynamischen Neuronalen Netzen, (1991); Hochreiter S., Bengio Y., Frasconi P., Schmidhuber J., Gradient flow in recurrent nets: The difficulty of learning long-term dependencies, A Field Guide to Dynamical Recurrent Networks, (2001); Graves A., Liwicki M., Fernandez S., Bertolami R., Bunke H., Schmidhuber J., A novel connectionist system for unconstrained handwriting recognition, IEEE Trans.

The human Brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs - 30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers - a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Face; Humans; Mathematics; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Visual Perception; article; chaotic dynamics; cochlear nerve; geometry; global climate; handwriting; image analysis; information processing; nerve fiber transport; nonlinear system; perception; principal component analysis; priority journal; reduction; sensory stimulation; vision","","","","","","","Young M.P., Yamane S., Science, 256, (1992); Shepard R.N., Science, 210, (1980); Turk M., Pentland A., J.

Often, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information. The models should not expose private information in these datasets. Addressing this goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Our implementation and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software complexity, training efficiency, and model quality. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Complex networks; Learning systems; Algorithmic techniques; Deep neural networks; Differential privacies; Machine learning techniques; Private information; Sensitive informations; Software complexity; Training efficiency; Cost benefit analysis","","","","","","","CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets; TensorFlow convolutional neural networks tutorial; TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, Software, (2015); Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., McMahan H.B., Mironov I., Talwar K., Zhang L., Deep learning with differential privacy, CoRR, (2016); Aggarwal C.C., On k-anonymity and the curse of dimensionality, VLDB, pp. 901-909, (2005); Agrawal R., Srikant R., Privacy-preserving data mining, SIGMOD, pp. 439-450, (2000); Bassily R., Nissim K., Smith A., Steinke T., Stemmer U., Ullman J., Algorithmic stability for adaptive data analysis, STOC, pp. 1046-1059, (2016); Bassily R., Smith A.D., Thakurta A., Private empirical risk minimization: Efficient algorithms and tight error bounds, FOCS, pp. 464-473, (2014); Beimel A., Brenner H., Kasiviswanathan S.P., Nissim K., Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release, Machine Learning, 94, 3, pp. 401-437, (2014); Brickell J., Shmatikov V., The cost of privacy: Destruction of data-mining utility in anonymized data publishing, KDD, pp. 70-78, (2008); Bun M., Steinke T., Concentrated differential privacy: Simplifications, extensions, and lower bounds, CoRR, (2016); Chaudhuri K., Monteleoni C., Sarwate A.D., Differentially private empirical risk minimization, J.

In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient–doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data Analysis; Deep Learning; Humans; Medicine; Physicians; adult; artificial intelligence; big data; clinician; cloud computing; deep learning; human; medical error; privacy; productivity; review; workflow; algorithm; data analysis; medicine; physician","","","","","National Institute of Health, (UL1TR002550)","Funding was provided by the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) from the National Institute of Health (NIH) grant number UL1TR002550.","Thakrar A.P., Et al., Child mortality in the US and 19 OECD comparator nations: a 50-year time-trend analysis, Health Aff.

Originating in the US, the basic idea and underlying theories have spread to other continents, and we are now within a period of highly active research in case-based reasoning in Europe as well. This paper gives an overview of the foundational issues related to case-based reasoning, describes some of the leading methodological approaches within the field, and exemplifies the current state through pointers to some systems. Initially, a general framework is defined, to which the subsequent descriptions and discussions will refer. The framework is influenced by recent methodologies for knowledge level descriptions of intelligent systems. The methods for case retrieval, reuse, solution testing, and learning are summarized, and their actual realization is discussed in the light of a few example systems that represent different CBR approaches. We also discuss the role of case-based methods as one type of reasoning and learning method within an integrated system architecture. © 1994 IOS Press and the authors.","","Inference engines; Knowledge based systems; Case based reasoning; Foundational issues; Methodological variations; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Aamodt A., Towards robust expert systems that learn from experience - an architectural framework, EKAW-89; Third European Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop, Paris, July, pp. 311-326, (1989); Aamodt A., A knowledge-intensive approach to problem solving and sustained learning, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Trondheim, Norwegian Institute of Technology, (1991); Aamodt A., Explanation-driven retrieval, reuse, and learning of cases, EWCBR-93: First European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, pp. 279-284, (1993); Althoff K.D., Knowledge acquisition in the domain of CNC machine centers; the MOLTKE approach, EKAW-89; Third European Workshop on Knowledge-Based Systems, pp. 180-195, (1989); Althoff K.-D., Machine learning and knowledge acquisition in a computational architecture for fault diagnosis in engineering systems, Proceedings of the ML-92 Workshop on Computational Architectures for Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition, (1992); Anderson J.R., The Architecture of Cognition, (1983); Aha D., Kibler D., Albert M.K., Instance-Based Learning Algorithms, Machine Learning, 6, 1, (1991); Allemagn D., Review of EWCBR’93: 1st European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, Alcommunica-Tions, 7, 2, (1993); Bareiss R., Exemplar-Based Knowledge Acquisition: A Unified Approach to Concept Representation, Classification, and Learning, (1989); Ashley K., Modeling Legal Arguments: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals, (1991); Bareiss R., PROTOS; a unified approach to concept representation, classification and learning, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Texas at Austin, Dept, of Computer Sciences, (1988); Branting K., Exploiting the complementarity of rules and precedents with reciprocity and fairness, Proceedings from the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop 1991, pp. 39-50, (1991); Brown B., Lewis L., A case-based reasoning solution to the problem of redundant resolutions of nonconformances in large scale manufacturing, Innovative Applications for Artificial Intelligence 3, (1991); Burstein M.H., Analogy vs. CBR; The purpose of mapping, Proceedings from the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop, pp. 133-136, (1989); Bomer K., Structural similarity as guidance in case-based design, First European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, Posters and Presentations, 1, pp. 14-19, (1993); Carbonell J., Derivational analogy; A theory of reconstructive problem solving and expertise acquisition, Machine Learning - an Artificial Intelligence Approach, 2, pp. 371-392, (1986); Cunningham P., Slattery S., Knowledge engineering requirements in derivational analogy, First European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, Posters and Presentations, 1, pp. 108-113, (1993); Cunningham P., Slattery S., Proceedings from the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop, (1989); Cunningham P., Slattery S., Proceedings from the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop, (1989); Cunningham P., Slattery S., First European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, Posters and Presentations, 1-2, (1993); Survey of FABEL, (1993); Gentner D., Structure mapping - a theoretical framework for analogy, Cognitive Science, 7, pp. 155-170, (1983); Hall R.P., Computational approaches to analogical reasoning; A comparative analysis, Artificial Intelligence, 39, 1, pp. 39-120, (1989); Hammond K.J., Case-Based Planning, (1989); Harmon P., Case-based reasoning III, Intelligent Software Strategies, 8, 1, (1992); Hennessy D., Hinkle D., Applying case-based reasoning to autoclave loading, IEEE Expert, 7, 5, pp. 21-26, (1992); Hinrichs T.R., Problem Solving in Open Worlds, (1992); Special Issue on Case-Based Reasoning, 7, 5, (1992); Keane M., Where’s the Beef?

Thomson Ave., United Kingdom","After [15],[31],[19],[8],[25],[5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style ""push-relabel"" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style ""augmenting paths."" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes. © 2004 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Energy Transfer; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Algorithms; Computational complexity; Edge detection; Graph theory; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Mathematical models; Optimization; Polynomials; Stereo vision; Three dimensional computer graphics; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; energy transfer; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Energy minimization; Graph algorithms; Maximum flow algorithms; Minimum cut algorithms; Multicamera scene reconstruction; Potts model; Computer vision","","","","","","","Bobick A.F., Intille S.S., Large occlusion stereo, Int'l J.

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Face; Humans; Mathematics; Pattern Recognition, Visual; article; data analysis; embedding; image analysis; nonlinear system; priority journal; reduction; science; sensory stimulation","","","","","","","Littman M.L., Swayne D.F., Dean N., Buja A., pp. 208-217, (1992); Cox T., Cox M., Multidimensional Scaling, (1994); Takane Y., Young F.W., Psychometrika, 42, (1977); Tenenbaum J., pp. 682-688, (1998); DeMers D., Cottrell G.W., pp. 580-587, (1993); Kramer M., AIChE J., 37, (1991); Kohonen T., Self-Organization and Associative Memory, (1988); Bishop C., Svensen M., Williams C., Neural Comput., 10, (1998); Klock H., Buhmann J., Pattern Recognition, 33, (1999); Hastie T.J., Stuetzle W., J.

Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes - either exactly or approximately - various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative ""turbo"" decoding algorithm, Pearl's belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms.","Belief propagation; Factor graphs; Fast Fourier transform; Forward/backward algorithm; Graphical models; Iterative decoding; Kalman filtering; Marginalization; Sum-product algorithm; Tanner graphs; Viterbi algorithm","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Decoding; Digital communication systems; Digital signal processing; Kalman filtering; Turbo codes; Belief propagation algorithms; Factor graphs; Sum-product algorithms; Graph theory","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-96-1-0930); Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation, AMBF; Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (DAAL01-96-2-0002); Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT","Manuscript received August 3, 1998; revised October 17, 2000.

It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Systems; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; algorithm; automation; computer simulation; decision making; education; financial system; health care; machine learning; manufacturing; marketing; World Wide Web; accuracy; causal modeling; decision theory; decision tree; human; kernel method; learning algorithm; machine learning; natural language processing; prediction; priority journal; Review; speech discrimination; support vector machine; algorithm; artificial intelligence; computer system; statistical analysis; trends","","","","","","","Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, (2011); Murphy K., Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, (2012); Valiant L., Commun.

Significant effort has been devoted to trying to provide practical solutions to this problem for problem instances encountered in a range of applications in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), as well as in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study has culminated in the development of several SAT packages, both proprietary and in the public domain (e.g. GRASP, SATO) which find significant use in both research and industry. Most existing complete solvers are variants of the Davis-Putnam (DP) search algorithm. In this paper we describe the development of a new complete solver, Chaff, which achieves significant performance gains through careful engineering of all aspects of the search - especially a particularly efficient implementation of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP) and a novel low overhead decision strategy. Chaff has been able to obtain one to two orders of magnitude performance improvement on diffi cult SAT benchmarks in comparison with other solvers (DP or otherwise), including GRASP and SATO.","Boolean satisfiability; Design verification","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Boolean algebra; Combinatorial mathematics; Problem solving; Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems; Electronic design automation (EDA); Computer aided software engineering","","","","","","","Baptista L., Marques-Silva J.P., Using randomization and learning to solve hard real-world instances of satisfiability, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP), (2000); Bayardo R., Schrag R., Using CSP look-back techniques to solve real-world SAT instances, Proc. of the 14th Nat.

By using Locality Preserving Projections (LPP), the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. Different from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which effectively see only the Euclidean structure of face space, LPP finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. The Laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. In this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. Theoretical analysis shows that PCA, LDA, and LPP can be obtained from different graph models. We compare the proposed Laplacianface approach with Eigenface and Fisherface methods on three different face data sets. Experimental results suggest that the proposed Laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition. © 2005 IEEE.","Face manifold; Face recognition; Linear discriminant analysis; Locality preserving projections; Principal component analysis; Subspace learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Computer Simulation; Discriminant Analysis; Face; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Statistical Distributions; Approximation theory; Data structures; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Graph theory; Image analysis; Learning algorithms; Mathematical models; Mathematical operators; Principal component analysis; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; biometry; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; discriminant analysis; evaluation; face; histology; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; principal component analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical distribution; statistical model; Euclidean structure; Face manifold; Laplace Beltrami operator; Laplacianface approach; Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Locality preserving projections; Subspace learning; Face recognition","","","","","","","Batur A.U., Hayes M.H., Linear Subspace for Illumination Robust Face Recognition, Proc.

Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the ""pure vision"" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera. © 2007 IEEE.","3D/stereo scene analysis; Autonomous vehicles; Tracking","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Systems; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photogrammetry; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Video Recording; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Digital cameras; Motion picture cameras; Real time systems; Robotics; Virtual reality; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer system; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; photography; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; videorecording; Autonomous vehicles; General motion model; Hand-held camera; Monocular camera; Three dimensional trajectory; Mobile robots","","","","","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (GR/R89080/01, GR/T24685); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS","This work was primarily performed while A.J.

In many experimental studies, the lack of the required properties for a proper application of parametric procedures - independence, normality, and homoscedasticity - yields to nonparametric ones the task of performing a rigorous comparison among algorithms. In this paper, we will discuss the basics and give a survey of a complete set of nonparametric procedures developed to perform both pairwise and multiple comparisons, for multi-problem analysis. The test problems of the CEC'2005 special session on real parameter optimization will help to illustrate the use of the tests throughout this tutorial, analyzing the results of a set of well-known evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. This tutorial is concluded with a compilation of considerations and recommendations, which will guide practitioners when using these tests to contrast their experimental results. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We observe that disparate backgrounds, languages, tools and techniques are a major barrier to effective communication among people, organisations and/or software systems. We show how the development and implementation of an explicit account of a shared understanding (i.e. an ""ontology"") in a given subject area, can improve such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greater reuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software. After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purposes they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits of and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the specification, implementation and evaluation of ontologies. Finally, we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field, considering various case studies, software tools for ontology development, key research issues and future prospects.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Formal languages; Information technology; Ontology; Knowledge engineering","","","","","Department of Trade and Industry, DTI","4The Enterprise Project is led by AIAI at The University of Edinburgh and the partners are IBM UK, Lloyd's Register, Logica and Unilever.

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art. © 2015 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Pattern recognition; Generative model; Human performance; Image descriptions; Machine translations; NAtural language processing; State of the art; Target descriptions; Training image; Computer vision","","","","","","","Aker A., Gaizauskas R., Generating image descriptions using dependency relational patterns, ACL, (2010); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Cho K., Van Merrienboer B., Gulcehre C., Bougares F., Schwenk H., Bengio Y., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, EMNLP, (2014); Donahue J., Jia Y., Vinyals O., Hoffman J., Zhang N., Tzeng E., Darrell T., Decaf: A deep convolutional activation feature for generic visual recognition, ICML, (2014); Elliott D., Keller F., Image description using visual dependency representations, EMNLP, (2013); Farhadi A., Hejrati M., Sadeghi M.A., Young P., Rashtchian C., Hockenmaier J., Forsyth D., Every picture tells a story: Generating sentences from images, ECCV, (2010); Gerber R., Nagel H.-H., Knowledge representation for the generation of quantified natural language descriptions of vehicle traffic in image sequences, ICIP.

As opposed to PCA, 2DPCA is based on 2D image matrices rather than 1D vectors so the image matrix does not need to be transformed into a vector prior to feature extraction. Instead, an image covariance matrix is constructed directly using the original image matrices, and its eigenvectors are derived for image feature extraction. To test 2DPCA and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments were performed on three face image databases: ORL, AR, and Yale face databases. The recognition rate across all trials was higher using 2DPCA than PCA. The experimental results also indicated that the extraction of image features is computationally more efficient using 2DPCA than PCA.","Eigenfaces; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Image representation; Principal Component Analysis (PCA)","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Face; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; Algorithms; Database systems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Mathematical transformations; Matrix algebra; Principal component analysis; Vectors; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; clinical trial; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; face; female; histology; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; male; mathematical computing; methodology; principal component analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; validation study; Image covariance matrix; Image representation; Face recognition","","","","","AutenticUZ, (UZ-2001-TEC-01); Centre of Multimedia Signal Processing; MCyT; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (60072034); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU, (TIC2002-04495-C02); Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, MICYT; Universidad de Zaragoza","This work is partially supported by Centre of Multimedia Signal Processing and the central fund from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories. © 2018 IEEE.","black-box models; Explainable artificial intelligence; interpretable machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Biological systems; Learning systems; Surveys; Transparency; Biological system modeling; Black-box model; Conferences; Market researches; Prediction algorithms; Learning algorithms","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA","A high-level analysis of XAI’s landscape leads to identify the key players and influencers behind this intense dynamic.

Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.","Artificial intelligence; Continual learning; Deep learning; Stability plasticity; Synaptic consolidation","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Learning; Memory; Mental Recall; Neural Networks (Computer); Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; brain; classification algorithm; controlled study; game; handwriting; human; human experiment; information processing; learning; learning disorder; memory consolidation; network learning; priority journal; problem solving; synapse; task performance; training; algorithm; artificial intelligence; computer simulation; memory; recall","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M019780/1)","","Legg S., Hutter M., Universal intelligence: A definition of machine intelligence, Minds Mach, 17, 4, pp. 391-444, (2007); French R.M., Catastrophic forgetting in connectionist networks, Trends Cognit Sci, 3, 4, pp. 128-135, (1999); McCloskey M., Cohen N.J., Catastrophic interference in connectionist networks: The sequential learning problem, The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 24, pp. 109-165, (1989); McClelland J.L., McNaughton B.L., O'Reilly R.C., Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: Insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory, Psychol Rev, 102, 3, pp. 419-457, (1995); Kumaran D., Hassabis D., McClelland J.L., What learning systems do intelligent agents need?

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-theart operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.","","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Forecasting; Information science; Learning systems; Precipitation (meteorology); Forecasting problems; Input-to-state; Machine learning approaches; Network capture; Rainfall intensity; Short periods; Spatiotemporal correlation; State-to-state transition; Weather forecasting","","","","","","","Bastien F., Lamblin P., Pascanu R., Bergstra J., Goodfellow I., Bergeron A., Bouchard N., Warde-Farley D., Bengio Y., Theano: New features and speed improvements, Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning NIPS 2012 Workshop, (2012); Bengio Y., Goodfellow I., Courville A., Deep Learning, (2015); Bergstra J., Breuleux O., Bastien F., Lamblin P., Pascanu R., Desjardins G., Turian J., Warde-Farley D., Bengio Y., Theano: A CPU and GPU math expression compiler, Scipy, 4, (2010); Bridson R., Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics, (2008); Brox T., Bruhn A., Papenberg N., Weickert J., High accuracy optical flow estimation based on a theory for warping, ECCV, pp. 25-36, (2004); Cheung P., Yeung H.Y., Application of optical-flow technique to significant convection nowcast for terminal areas in Hong Kong, The 3rd WMO International Symposium on Nowcasting and Very Short-Range Forecasting (WSN12), pp. 6-10, (2012); Cho K., Van Merrienboer B., Gulcehre C., Bougares F., Schwenk H., Bengio Y., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, EMNLP, pp. 1724-1734, (2014); Donahue J., Hendricks L.A., Guadarrama S., Rohrbach M., Venugopalan S., Saenko K., Darrell T., Long-term recurrent convolutional networks for visual recognition and description, CVPR, (2015); Douglas R.H., The stormy weather group (Canada), Radar in Meteorology, pp. 61-68, (1990); Germann U., Zawadzki I., Scale-dependence of the predictability of precipitation from continental radar images.

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.

This procedure incorporates both geometric information derived from the cortical model, and neuroanatomical convention, as found in the training set. The result is a complete labeling of cortical sulci and gyri. Examples are given from two different training sets generated using different neuroanatomical conventions, illustrating the flexibility of the algorithm. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling.","","Algorithms; Anisotropy; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Markov Chains; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Schizophrenia; algorithm; anisotropy; article; automation; brain cortex; comparative study; geometry; model; morphometrics; neuroanatomy; prediction; priority journal; probability; spatial discrimination; technique; validation process","","","","","CHRU; Faculté de Médecine; Theodore and Vada Stanley Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH056956); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P41-RR14075, R01-NS34189, R01-NS39581, R01-RR13609); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS; National Center for Research Resources, NCRR, (R01 RR16594-01A1); Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assn.; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, NARSAD","This research is funded jointly by the National Center for Research Resources (R01 RR16594-01A1), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Cancer Institute (R01-NS39581, R01-NS34189).

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.","","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Classification models; Covariate shifts; Deep neural networks; Higher learning; Learning rates; Model architecture; Network training; State of the art; Image classification","","","","","","","Bengio Y., Glorot X., Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks, Proceedings of AISTATS 2010, 9, pp. 249-256, (2010); Dean J., Corrado G.S., Monga R., Chen K., Devin M., Le Quoc V., Mao M.Z., Ranzato M., Senior A., Tucker P., Yang K., Ng A.Y., Large scale distributed deep networks, NIPS, (2012); Guillaume D., Koray K., Natural Neural Networks; Duchi J., Hazan E., Singer Y., Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization, J.

Ant colony optimization takes inspiration from the forging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit Pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. The model proposed by Deneubourg and co-workers for explaining the foraging behavior of ants is the main source of inspiration for the development of ant colony optimization. In ACO a number of artificial ants build solutions to an optimization problem and exchange information on their quality through a communication scheme that is reminiscent of the one adopted by real ants. ACO algorithms is introduced and all ACO algorithms share the same idea and the ACO is formalized into a meta-heuristics for combinatorial problems. It is foreseeable that future research on ACO will focus more strongly on rich optimization problems that include stochasticity.","","Algorithms; Computational methods; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Problem solving; Stochastic control systems; Ant colony optimization (ACO); Forging behavior; Optimization problems; Pheromone; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Grasse P.-P., La reconstruction du nid et les coordinations interindividuelles chez Bellicositermes Natalensis et Cubitermes sp.

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results. ©2008 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Computer vision; Education; Feature extraction; Image processing; Motion pictures; Pattern recognition; Standards; Address recognition; Alternative methods; Annotation errors; Automatic annotation; Data sets; Human actions; Multi channels; Noisy labels; Non-linear; Time features; Training sets; Video classification; Video datasets; Visual learning; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Berg T., Berg A., Edwards J., Maire M., White R., Teh Y., Learned Miller E., Forsyth D., Names and faces in the news, CVPR, (2004); Bosch A., Zisserman A., Munoz X., Representing shape with a spatial pyramid kernel, CIVR, (2007); Dollar P., Rabaud V., Cottrell G., Belongie S., Behavior recognition via sparse spatio-temporal features, VS-PETS, (2005); Everingham M., Sivic J., Zisserman A., Hello! my name is...

Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components - not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to resent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.","Analogue processing; Categories; Concepts; Frames; Imagery; Images; Knowledge; Perception;

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-ref =redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy. © 2005 IEEE.","Classification; Feature selection; Maximal dependency; Maximal relevance; Minimal redundancy; Mutual information","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Neoplasms; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Algorithms; Approximation theory; Optimization; Pattern recognition; Probability density function; Theorem proving; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; classification; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; human; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; neoplasm; statistical model; Feature selection; Maximal dependency; Maximal relevance; Minimal redundancy; Mutual information; Feature extraction","","","","","","","Alizadeh A.A., Et al., Distinct Types of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Identified by Gene Expression Profiling, Nature, 403, pp. 503-511, (2000); Burges C.J.C., A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition, Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2, pp. 1-43, (1998); Cover T., Thomas J., Elements of Information Theory, (1991); Cover T.M., The Best Two Independent Measurements Are Not the Two Best, IEEE Trans.

It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering.

It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

(1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. “Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking. © 1980, Cambridge University Press.

One is that, in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security.We propose a possible solution to these challenges: Secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning.We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Federated learning; GDPR; transfer learning","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Data network; Effective solution; Federated learning; GDPR; Isolated islands; Learning frameworks; Transfer learning; User privacy; Data privacy","","","","","","","Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., Brendan McMahan H., Mironov I., Talwar K., Zhang L., Deep learning with differential privacy, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'16), pp. 308-318, (2016); Acar A., Aksu H., Selcuk Uluagac A., Conti M., A survey on homomorphic encryption schemes: Theory and implementation, ACM Comput.

In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive knearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.","","Artificial intelligence; Factorization; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Nearest neighbor search; Stochastic systems; Bootstrap samplings; Generic optimization; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Learning techniques; Matrix factorizations; Optimization method; Optimizing models; Stochastic gradient descent; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Burges C., Shaked T., Renshaw E., Lazier A., Deeds M., Hamilton N., Hullender G., Learning to rank using gradient descent, ICML 2005 - Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 89-96, (2005); Deshpande M., Karypis G., Item-based top-n recommendation algorithms, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 22, 1, (2004); Herschtal A., Raskutti B., Optimising area under the roc curve using gradient descent, ICML '04: Proceedings of the Twenty-first International Conference on Machine Learning, (2004); Hofmann T., Latent semantic models for collaborative filtering, ACM Trans.

Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition.We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded fromthe analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space inwhich they are embedded.We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Pattern Recognition, Automated; algorithm; cluster analysis; numerical method; outlier; performance assessment; algorithm; article; cluster analysis; priority journal; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; factual database","","","","","","","Xu R., Wunsch II D., IEEE Trans.

Having conducted a statistical analysis on this data set, we found two important issues which highly affects the performance of evaluated systems, and results in a very poor evaluation of anomaly detection approaches. To solve these issues, we have proposed a new data set, NSL-KDD, which consists of selected records of the complete KDD data set and does not suffer from any of mentioned shortcomings. © 2009 IEEE.","","Anomaly detection; Data sets; Statistical analysis; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Landwehr C.E., Bull A.R., McDermott J.P., Choi W.S., A taxonomy of computer program security flaws, ACM Comput.

As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition. After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations - not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed. We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed. Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey- there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it. © 2014 C.

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available.","Energy minimization; Graph algorithms; Markov Random Fields; Maximum flow; Minimum cut; Optimization","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; User-Computer Interface; Binary sequences; Computational complexity; Energy efficiency; Functions; General purpose computers; Graph theory; Heuristic programming; Image reconstruction; Markov processes; Optimization; Problem solving; Energy minimization; Graph algorithms; Markov random fields; Maximum flow; Minimum cut; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer interface; evaluation; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Computer science","","","","","Microsoft Research, MSR; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (CCR-0113371, IIS-9900115)","The authors are grateful to Olga Veksler and Yuri Boykov for their careful reading of this paper and for valuable comments that greatly improved its readability.

Given a set of data samples (vectors) approximately drawn from a union of multiple subspaces, our goal is to cluster the samples into their respective subspaces and remove possible outliers as well. To this end, we propose a novel objective function named Low-Rank Representation (LRR), which seeks the lowest rank representation among all the candidates that can represent the data samples as linear combinations of the bases in a given dictionary. It is shown that the convex program associated with LRR solves the subspace clustering problem in the following sense: When the data is clean, we prove that LRR exactly recovers the true subspace structures; when the data are contaminated by outliers, we prove that under certain conditions LRR can exactly recover the row space of the original data and detect the outlier as well; for data corrupted by arbitrary sparse errors, LRR can also approximately recover the row space with theoretical guarantees. Since the subspace membership is provably determined by the row space, these further imply that LRR can perform robust subspace clustering and error correction in an efficient and effective way. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Low-rank representation; outlier detection; segmentation; subspace clustering","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Models, Theoretical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Clustering algorithms; Error correction; Image segmentation; Recovery; Statistics; Convex programs; Data sample; Linear combinations; Low-rank representation; Objective functions; Outlier Detection; Subspace clustering; MLCS; MLOWN; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer simulation; methodology; signal processing; theoretical model; Vectors","","","","","","","Gear W., Multibody grouping from motion images, Int'l J.

An assumption of traditional machine learning methodologies is the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain, such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same. However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning. Lastly, there is information listed on software downloads for various transfer learning solutions and a discussion of possible future research work. The transfer learning solutions surveyed are independent of data size and can be applied to big data environments. © 2016, The Author(s).","Data mining; Domain adaptation; Machine learning; Survey; Transfer learning","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Learning systems; Data-mining techniques; Domain adaptation; Feature data; Input features; Machine data; Machine-learning; Real-world; Testing data; Training data; Transfer learning; Data mining","","","","","","","Ando R.K., Zhang T., A framework for learning predictive structures from multiple tasks and unlabeled data, J Mach Learn Res, 6, pp. 1817-1853, (2005); Bay H., Tuytelaars T., Gool L.V., Surf: speeded up robust features, Comput Vis Image Underst, 110, 3, pp. 346-359, (2006); Belkin M., Niyogi P., Sindhwani V., Manifold regularization: a geometric framework for learning from examples, J Mach Learn Res Arch, 7, pp. 2399-2434, (2006); Blitzer J., McDonald R., Pereira F., Domain adaptation with structural correspondence learning, In: Proceedings of the 2006 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, 2006, pp. 120-128; Bonilla E., Chai K.M., Williams C., Multi-task Gaussian process prediction, In: Proceedings of the 20th annual conference of neural information processing systems, 2008, pp. 153-160; Borgwardt K.M., Gretton A., Rasch M.J., Kriegel H.P., Scholkopf B., Smola A.J., Integrating structured biological data by kernel maximum mean discrepancy, Bioinformatics, 22, 4, pp. 49-57, (2006); Bruzzone L., Marconcini M., Domain adaptation problems: a DASVM classification technique and a circular validation strategy, IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 32, 5, pp. 770-787, (2010); Cao B., Liu N., Yang Q., Transfer learning for collective link prediction in multiple heterogeneous domains, In: Proceedings of the 27th international conference on machine learning, 2010, pp. 159-166; Cawley G., Leave-one-out cross-validation based model selection criteria for weighted LS-SVMs, In: IEEE 2006 international joint conference on neural network proceedings, 2006, pp. 1661-1668; Chelba C., Acero A., Adaptation of maximum entropy classifier: little data can help a lot, Comput Speech Lang, 20, 4, pp. 382-399, (2004); Chen M., Xu Z.E., Weinberger K.Q., Sha F., Marginalized denoising autoencoders for domain adaptation, ICML. arXiv preprintarXiv, 1206, (2012); Chung F.R.K., Spectral graph theory, CBMS regional conference series in mathematics, no, (1994); Cook D.J., Feuz K.D., Krishnan N.C., Transfer learning for activity recognition: a survey, Knowl Inf Syst, 36, 3, pp. 537-556, (2012); Dai W., Chen Y., Xue G.R., Yang Q., Yu Y., Translated learning: transfer learning across different feature spaces, Adv Neural Inform Process Syst, 21, pp. 353-360, (2008); Dai W., Yang Q., Xue G.R., Yu Y., Boosting for transfer learning.

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function. © 2010 IEEE.","deformable models; discriminative training; latent SVM.; Object recognition; pictorial structures","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Discriminant Analysis; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Deformation; Data sets; Deformable models; Discriminative training; Labeled data; Latent information; Latent value; Latent variable; Multiscales; Negative examples; Object class; Object Detection; Object detection systems; Objective functions; Pictorial structures; Positive examples; Training algorithms; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; image enhancement; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Object recognition","","","","","US National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (0746569, 1215812)","This material is based upon work supported by the US National Science Foundation under Grant No. IIS 0746569","Amit Y., Kong A., Graphical templates for model registration, IEEE Trans.

The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering. © Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David 2014.","","Artificial intelligence; Communication channels (information theory); Complex networks; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mathematical transformations; Parallel processing systems; Stochastic systems; Students; Textbooks; Graduate course; Mathematical derivation; PAC-Bayes; Stochastic gradient descent; Education","","","","","","","Abernethy J., Bartlett P.L., Rakhlin A., Tewari A., Optimal strategies and minimax lower bounds for online convex games, Proceedings of the Nineteenth Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, (2008); Ackerman M., Ben-David S., Measures of clustering quality: A working set of axioms for clustering, Proceedings of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pp. 121-128, (2008); Agarwal S., Roth D., Learnability of bipartite ranking functions, Proceedings of the 18Th Annual Conference on Learning Theory, pp. 16-31, (2005); Agmon S., The relaxation method for linear inequalities, Canadian Journal of Mathematics, 6, 3, pp. 382-392, (1954); Aizerman M.A., Braverman E.M., Rozonoer L.I., Theoretical foundations of the potential function method in pattern recognition learning, Automation and Remote Control, 25, pp. 821-837, (1964); Allwein E.L., Schapire R., Singer Y., Reducing multiclass to binary: A unifying approach for margin classifiers, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 1, pp. 113-141, (2000); Alon N., Ben-David S., Cesa-Bianchi N., Haussler D., Scale-sensitive dimensions, uniform convergence, and learnability, Journal of the ACM, 44, 4, pp. 615-631, (1997); Anthony M., Bartlet P., Neural Network Learning, (1999); Baraniuk R., Davenport M., DeVore R., Wakin M., A simple proof of the restricted isometry property for random matrices, Constructive Approximation, 28, 3, pp. 253-263, (2008); Barber D., Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning, (2012); Bartlett P., Bousquet O., Mendelson S., Local rademacher complexities, Annals of Statistics, 33, 4, pp. 1497-1537, (2005); Bartlett P.L., Ben-David S., Hardness results for neural network approximation problems, Theor.

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks. © 2015 IEEE.","Biomedical imaging; computer aided diagnosis; image analysis; machine learning; neural networks","Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Lymph Nodes; Neural Networks (Computer); Reproducibility of Results; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided instruction; Computer networks; Computerized tomography; Convolution; Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image classification; Image recognition; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pulmonary diseases; Abdominal lymph nodes; Biomedical imaging; Classification results; Computer aided detection; Convolutional neural network; Empirical evaluations; Interstitial lung disease; State-of-the-art performance; architecture; Article; classification; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; diagnostic imaging; human; interstitial lung disease; lymph node; machine learning; major clinical study; support vector machine; task performance; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; factual database; procedures; reproducibility; Computer aided diagnosis","","","","","Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Republic of Korea; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (ZIACL040004); NIH Clinical Center; Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, KRIBB","This work was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, and in part by a grant from the KRIBB Research Initiative Program (Korean Biomedical Scientist Fellowship Program), Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Republic of Korea.","Deng J., Et al., ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, Proc.

Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package. © 2015 Bach et al.

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Classification; Feature selection; Filter; Wrapper","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data structures; Decision theory; Formal logic; Learning algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Feature selection; Wrappers; Learning systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF","We would also like to thank Karl Pfleger for his help in formulating the wrapper idea.

Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues.

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Radio etiquette is the set of RF bands, air interfaces, protocols, and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate the use of the radio spectrum. Cognitive radio extends the software radio with radio-domain model-based reasoning about such etiquettes. Cognitive radio enhances the flexibility of personal services through a Radio Knowledge Representation Language. This language represents knowledge of radio etiquette, devices, software modules, propagation, networks, user needs, and application scenarios in a way that supports automated reasoning about the needs of the user. This empowers software radios to conduct expressive negotiations among peers about the use of radio spectrum across fluents of space, time, and user context. With RKRL, cognitive radio agents may actively manipulate the protocol stack to adapt known etiquettes to better satisfy the user's needs. This transforms radio nodes from blind executors of predefined protocols to radio-domain-aware intelligent agents that search out ways to deliver the services the user wants even if that user does not know how to obtain them. Software radio [1] provides an ideal platform for the realization of cognitive radio.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Computer software; Knowledge representation; Network protocols; Personal communication systems; Telecommunication services; Automated reasoning; Cognitive radio; Intelligent agents; Radio knowledge representation language; Software radio; Radio communication","","","","","","","Mitola J., Software Radio: Wireless Architecture for the 21st Century; Kaufman S., At Home in the Universe, (1995); Mitola J., Cognitive Radio, (1998); Location-Aware Computing and Communications Home Pages; Henning M., Location Aware Mobile Applications Based on Directory Services, (1997); Specification and Description Language, (1991); Eriksson, Penker, UML Toolkit, (1998); Mowbray, Zehavi, The Essential CORBA, Object Management Group, (1995); Verilog, Object GEODE, (1998); Finin T., KQML - A Language and Protocol for Knowledge and Information Exchange, Int'l.

Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that BLSTM is an effective architecture with which to exploit it. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.","","Algorithmic approach; Computer clusters; Deep belief networks; Feature learning; Hyper-parameter; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Images classification; Neural-networks; Random searches; State of the art; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Larochelle H., Erhan D., Courville A., Bergstra J., Bengio Y., An empirical evaluation of deep architectures on problems with many factors of variation, ICML, 2007, pp. 473-480, (2007); Hinton G.E., Osindero S., Teh Y., A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets, Neural Computation, 18, pp. 1527-1554, (2006); Vincent P., Larochelle H., Lajoie I., Bengio Y., Manzagol P.A., Stacked denoising autoencoders: Learning useful representations in a deep network with a local denoising criterion, Machine Learning Research, 11, pp. 3371-3408, (2010); Lecun Y., Bottou L., Bengio Y., Haffner P., Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE, 86, 11, pp. 2278-2324, (1998); Pinto N., Doukhan D., Dicarlo J.J., Cox D.D., A high-throughput screening approach to discovering good forms of biologically inspired visual representation, PLoS Comput Biol, 5, 11, (2009); Coates A., Lee H., Ng A., An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning, NIPS Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning Workshop, (2010); Coates A., Ng A.Y., The importance of encoding versus training with sparse coding and vector quantization, Proceedings of the Twenty-eighth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML- 11), (2010); Hutter F., Automated Configuration of Algorithms for Solving Hard Computational Problems, (2009); Hutter F., Hoos H., Leyton-Brown K., Sequential model-based optimization for general algorithm configuration, LION-5, (2011); Jones D.R., A taxonomy of global optimization methods based on response surfaces, Journal of Global Optimization, 21, pp. 345-383, (2001); Villemonteix J., Vazquez E., Walter E., An informational approach to the global optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions, Journal of Global Optimization, (2006); Srinivas N., Krause A., Kakade S., Seeger M., Gaussian process optimization in the bandit setting: No regret and experimental design, ICML, (2010); Mockus J., Tiesis V., Zilinskas A., The application of bayesian methods for seeking the extremum, Towards Global Optimization, 2, pp. 117-129, (1978); Rasmussen C.E., Williams C., Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning; Ginsbourger D., Dupuy D., Badea A., Carraro L., Roustant O., A Note on the Choice and the Estimation of Kriging Models for the Analysis of Deterministic Computer Experiments, 25, pp. 115-131, (2009); Bardenet R., Kegl B., Surrogating the surrogate: Accelerating Gaussian Process optimization with mixtures, ICML, (2010); Larranaga P., Lozano J., Estimation of Distribution Algorithms: A New Tool for Evolutionary Computation, (2001); Hansen N., The CMA evolution strategy: A comparing review, Towards A New Evolutionary Computation.

We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Classification performance; Convolutional networks; Model architecture; Novel visualizations; Benchmarking","","","","","Microsoft Research; National Science Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1116923); Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE","","Bengio Y., Lamblin P., Popovici D., Larochelle H., Greedy layer-wise training of deep networks, NIPS, pp. 153-160, (2007); Berkes P., Wiskott L., On the analysis and interpretation of inhomogeneous quadratic forms as receptive fields, Neural Computation, (2006); Bo L., Ren X., Fox D., Multipath sparse coding using hierarchical matching pursuit, CVPR, (2013); Ciresan D.C., Meier J., Schmidhuber J., Multi-column deep neural networks for image classification, CVPR, (2012); Dalal N., Triggs B., Histograms of oriented gradients for pedestrian detection, CVPR, (2005); Deng J., Dong W., Socher R., Li L.J., Li K., Fei-Fei L., ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database, CVPR 2009, (2009); Donahue J., Jia Y., Vinyals O., Hoffman J., Zhang N., Tzeng E., Darrell T., DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition, (2013); Erhan D., Bengio Y., Courville A., Vincent P., Visualizing Higher-layer Features of a Deep Network, (2009); Fei-fei L., Fergus R., Perona P., One-shot learning of object categories, IEEE Trans.

Despite the different motivations of these algorithms, we present in this paper a general formulation known as graph embedding to unify them within a common framework. In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/ tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability. We show that MFA effectively overcomes the limitations of the traditional linear discriminant analysis algorithm due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions. Real face recognition experiments show the superiority of our proposed MFA in comparison to LDA, also for corresponding kernel and tensor extensions. © 2007 IEEE.","Dimensionality reduction; Graph embedding framework; Manifold learning; Subspace learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Discriminant Analysis; Face; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Computational geometry; Discriminant analysis; Fisher information matrix; Graphic methods; Information management; Tensors; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; discriminant analysis; face; histology; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Data distribution; Dimensionality reduction; Graph embedding; Manifold learning; Scale normalization; Subspace learning; Embedded systems","","","","","","","Batur A., Hayes M., Linear Subspaces for Illumination Robust Face Recognition, Proc.

One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and nonresidual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images - two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets - consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The most widely used applications of protein CD are to determine whether an expressed, purified protein is folded, or if a mutation affects its conformation or stability. In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions. This protocol details the basic steps of obtaining and interpreting CD data, and methods for analyzing spectra to estimate the secondary structural composition of proteins. CD has the advantage that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing ≤20 μg of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours. However, it does not give the residue-specific information that can be obtained by x-ray crystallography or NMR.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Buffers; Circular Dichroism; Linear Models; Peptides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Proteins; Statistics; buffer; peptide; protein; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; chemistry; circular dichroism; methodology; protein secondary structure; statistical model; statistics","","protein, 67254-75-5; Buffers, ; Peptides, ; Proteins, ","","","Circular Dichroism Facility at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; UMDNJ; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (R01GM036326)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank M.A. Andrade, W.C.

To rapidly construct a reasonable MSA, we developed the initial version of the MAFFT program in 2002. MSA software is now facing greater challenges in both scalability and accuracy than those of 5 years ago. As increasing amounts of sequence data are being generated by large-scale sequencing projects, scalability is now critical in many situations. The requirement of accuracy has also entered a new stage since the discovery of functional noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); the secondary structure should be considered for constructing a high-quality alignment of distantly related ncRNAs. To deal with these problems, in 2007, we updated MAFFT to Version 6 with two new techniques: the PartTree algorithm and the Four-way consistency objective function. The former improved the scalability of progressive alignment and the latter improved the accuracy of ncRNA alignment. We review these and other techniques that MAFFT uses and suggest possible future directions of MSA software as a basis of comparative analyses. MAFFT is available at http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software. © The Author 2008.

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Compressed sensing; Compressive sampling; Nonlinear reconstruction; Random sampling; Rapid MRI; Sparse reconstruction; Sparsity","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Data Compression; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; angiography; article; image reconstruction; mathematical model; multidetector computed tomography; noise; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; randomization; sampling; simulation; three dimensional imaging","","","","","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (R01HL075803)","","Marseille G.J., de Beer R., Fuderer M., Mehlkopf A.F., van Ormondt D., Nonuniform phase-encode distributions for MRI scan time reduction, J Magn Reson, 111, pp. 70-75, (1996); Scheffler K., Hennig J., Reduced circular field-of-view imaging, Magn Reson Med, 40, pp. 474-480, (1998); Tsai C.M., Nishimura D., Reduced aliasing artifacts using variable-density k-space sampling trajectories, Magn Reson Med, 43, pp. 452-458, (2000); Peters D.C., Korosec F.R., Grist T.M., Block W.F., Holden J.E., Vigen K.K., Mistretta C.A., Undersampled projection reconstruction applied to MR angiography, Magn Reson Med, 43, pp. 91-101, (2000); Greiser A., von Kienlin M., Efficient k-space sampling by density-weighted phase-encoding, Magn Reson Med, 50, pp. 1266-1275, (2003); McGibney G., Smith M.R., Nichols S.T., Crawley A., Quantitative evaluation of several partial Fourier reconstruction algorithms used in MRI, Magn Reson Med, 30, pp. 51-59, (1993); Pruessmann K.P., Weiger M., Scheidegger M.B., Boesiger P., SENSE: Sensitivity encoding for fast MRI, Magn Reson Med, 42, pp. 952-962, (1999); Sodickson D.K., Manning W.J., Simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH): Fast imaging with radiofrequency coil arrays, Magn Reson Med, 38, pp. 591-603, (1997); Korosec F.R., Frayne R., Grist T.M., Mistretta C.A., Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography, Magn Reson Med, 36, pp. 345-351, (1996); Madore B., Glover G., Pelc N., Unaliasing by fourier-encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension (UNFOLD), applied to cardiac imaging and fMRI, Magn Reson Med, 42, pp. 813-828, (1999); Wajer F., Non-cartesian MRI scan time reduction through sparse sampling, (2001); Tsao J., Boesiger P., Pruessmann K.P., k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE: Dynamic MRI with high frame rate exploiting spatiotemporal correlations, Magn Reson Med, 50, pp. 1031-1042, (2003); Mistretta C.A., Wieben O., Velikina J., Block W., Perry J., Wu Y., Johnson K., Wu Y., Highly constrained backprojection for time-resolved MRI, Magn Reson Med, 55, pp. 30-40, (2006); Candes E., Romberg J., Tao T., Robust uncertainty principles: Exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information, IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 52, pp. 489-509, (2006); Donoho D., Compressed sensing, IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 52, pp. 1289-1306, (2006); Santos J.M., Cunningham C.H., Lustig M., Hargreaves B.A., Hu B.S., Nishimura D.G., Pauly J.M., Single breath-hold whole-heart MRA using variable-density spirals at 3T, Magn Reson Med, 55, pp. 371-379, (2006); Chang T.C., He L., Fang T., MR image reconstruction from sparse radial samples using bregman iteration, Proceedings of the 13th Annual Meeting of ISMRM, (2006); Ye J.C., Tak S., Han Y., Park H.W., Projection reconstruction MR imaging using FOCUSS, Magn Reson Med, 57, pp. 764-775, (2007); Block K.T., Uecker M., Frahm J., Undersampled radial MRI with multiple coils.

In the KEGG database, genes in complete genomes are annotated with the KEGG orthology (KO) identifiers, or the K numbers, based on the best hit information using Smith- Waterman scores as well as by the manual curation. Each K number represents an ortholog group of genes, and it is directly linked to an object in the KEGG pathway map or the BRITE functional hierarchy. Here, we have developed a web-based server called KAAS (KEGG Automatic Annotation Server: http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/) i.e. an implementation of a rapid method to automatically assign K numbers to genes in the genome, enabling reconstruction of KEGG pathways and BRITE hierarchies. The method is based on sequence similarities, bi-directional best hit information and some heuristics, and has achieved a high degree of accuracy when compared with the manually curated KEGG GENES database. © 2007 The Author(s).","","Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Chromosome Mapping; Computational Biology; Database Management Systems; Documentation; Genome; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Proteome; Sequence Analysis; Signal Transduction; Vocabulary, Controlled; proteome; animal; article; artificial intelligence; automation; biology; chromosome map; classification; data base; documentation; genome; human; information retrieval; Internet; linguistics; metabolism; methodology; physiology; sequence analysis; signal transduction","","Proteome, ","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Ministry of Education, MOE","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate-everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments. © 1991.","","Automata Theory - Finite Automata; Robots - Intelligent; Decomposition by Activity; Incremental Intelligence; Artificial Intelligence","","","","","Systems Development Foundation; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-86-K-0685); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA, (N00014-85-K-0124)","* This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Optically, this is due to the substantial presence of particles in the atmosphere that absorb and scatter light. In computer vision, the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight. Based on this model, a few methods have been proposed, and most of them require multiple input images of a scene, which have either different degrees of polarization or different atmospheric conditions. This requirement is the main drawback of these methods, since in many situations, it is difficult to be fulfilled. To resolve the problem, we introduce an automated method that only requires a single input image. This method is based on two basic observations: first, images with enhanced visibility (or clear-day images) have more contrast than images plagued by bad weather; second, airlight whose variation mainly depends on the distance of objects to the viewer, tends to be smooth. Relying on these two observations, we develop a cost function in the framework of Markov random fields, which can be efficiently optimized by various techniques, such as graph-cuts or belief propagation. The method does not require the geometrical information of the input image, and is applicable for both color and gray images. ©2008 British Crown Copyright.","","Absorption; Artificial intelligence; Cellular radio systems; Computational geometry; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Fiber optics; Hidden Markov models; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Optical properties; Pattern recognition; Visibility; AS-graph; Atmospheric conditions; Belief propagation; Degrees of polarization; Fog and haze; Geometrical informations; Gray images; Input images; Linear combination; Markov Random Fields; Multiple inputs; Scattering processes; Single images; Single input; Computational methods","","","","","","","Fattal R., Single image dehazing, to appear in SIGGRAPH, (2008); Gijsejij A., Gevers T., Color constancy using natural image statistics, proceeding of IEEE CVPR, (2007); Hautiere N., Tarel J., Aubert D., Toward fog-free in-vechicle vision systems through contrast restoration, CVPR, (2007); McCartney E., Optics of the atmosphere: Scattering by molecules and particles, (1975); Narasimhan S., Nayar S., Interactive deweathering of an image using physical models, IEEE Workshop on Color and Photometric Method in Computer Vision, (2003); Narasimhan S.G., Nayar S.K., Contrast restoration of weather degraded images, IEEE PAMI, 25, 6, (2003); Nayar S.K., Narasimhan S.G., Vision in bad weather, ICCV, 2, pp. 820-827, (1999); Schechner Y., Napel N., Clear underwater vision, CVPR, (2004); Schechner Y.Y., Narasimhan S.G., Nayar S.K., Instant dehazing of images using polarization, 1, pp. 325-332, (2001); Shwartz S., Namer E., Schechner Y., Blind haze separation, CVPR, (2006); Szeliski R., Zabih R., Scharstein D., Veksler O., Kolmogorov V., Agarwala A., Tappen M., Rother C., A comparative study of energy minimization methods for markov random fields, proceeding of ECCV, (2006)","R.

The relation between the belief function and the probability function when decisions must be made is derived and justified. Four paradigms are analyzed in order to compare Bayesian, upper and lower probability, and the transferable belief approaches. © 1994.","Belief function; Dempster-Shafer theory; quantified beliefs","Mathematical models; Probability; Belief functions; Dempster Shafer theory; Quantified beliefs; Transferable belief models; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Belgian National Incentive-Program for Fundamental Research in Artificial Intelligence; CEC-ESPRIT","Correspondence to: P.

The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes.

In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netflix's own system.","","Artificial intelligence; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Error rate; Factorization model; Large datasets; Machine modelling; Modeling parameters; Netflix; Probabilistic matrix factorizations; Restricted boltzmann machine; Collaborative filtering","","","","","","","Dueck D., Frey B., Probabilistic sparse matrix factorization, Technical Report PSI TR 2004-023, Dept. of Computer Science, (2004); Hofmann T., Probabilistic latent semantic analysis, Proceedings of the 15th Conference on Uncertainty in AI, pp. 289-296, (1999); Marlin B., Modeling user rating profiles for collaborative filtering, NIPS, (2003); Marlin B., Zemel R.S., The multiple multiplicative factor model for collaborative filtering, Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-first International Conference (ICML 2004), Banff, Alberta, Canada, July 4-8, 2004, (2004); Neal R.M., Probabilistic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, Technical Report CRG-TR-93-1, Department of Computer Science, (1993); Nowlan S.J., Hinton G.E., Simplifying neural networks by soft weight-sharing, Neural Computation, 4, pp. 473-493, (1992); Jason D., Rennie M., Srebro N., Fast maximum margin matrix factorization for collaborative prediction. in Luc de Raedt and Stefan Wrobel editors, Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-Second International Conference (ICML 2005), Bonn, Germany, August 7-11, 2005, pp. 713-719, (2005); Salakhutdinov R., Mnih A., Hinton G., Restricted Boltzmann machines for collaborative filtering, Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth International Conference (ICML 2004), (2007); Srebro N., Jaakkola T., Weighted low-rank approximations, Machine Learning, Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference (ICML 2003), August 21-24, 2003, Washington, DC, USA, pp. 720-727, (2003); Srebro N., Jason D., Rennie M., Jaakkola T., Maximum-margin matrix factorization, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2004); Tipping M.E., Bishop C.M., Probabilistic principal component analysis, Technical Report NCRG/97/010, Neural Computing Research Group, (1997); Welling M., Rosen-Zvi M., Hinton G., Exponential family harmoniums with an application to information retrieval, NIPS, 17, pp. 1481-1488, (2005)","R.

Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose. ©2008 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Decision support systems; Feature extraction; Image processing; Information management; Pattern recognition; Search engines; Support vector machines; Three dimensional; Discriminative training; Latent information; Multi scaling; Negative examples; Object detection; Person detection; Positive examples; Deformation","","","","","","","Amit Y., Trouve A., POP: Patchwork of parts models for object recognition, IJCV, 75, 2, pp. 267-282, (2007); Burl M., Weber M., Perona P., A probabilistic approach to object recognition using local photometry and global geometry, ECCV, pages II, pp. 628-641, (1998); Crandall D., Felzenszwalb P., Huttenlocher D., Spatial priors for part-based recognition using statistical models, CVPR, pp. 10-17, (2005); Crandall D., Huttenlocher D., Weakly supervised learning of part-based spatial models for visual object recognition, ECCV, pages I, pp. 16-29, (2006); Dalal N., Triggs B., Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection, CVPR, pages I, pp. 886-893, (2005); Epshtein B., Ullman S., Semantic hierarchies for recognizing objects and parts, CVPR, (2007); Felzenszwalb P., Huttenlocher D., Distance transforms of sampled functions, Cornell Computing and Information Science Technical Report; Felzenszwalb P., Huttenlocher D., Pictorial structures for object recognition, IJCV, 61, 1, (2005); Felzenszwalb P., McAllester D., The generalized A* architecture, JAIR, 29, pp. 153-190, (2007); Fergus R., Perona P., Zisserman A., Object class recognition by unsupervised scale-invariant learning, CVPR, (2003); Fischler M., Elschlager R., The representation and matching of pictorial structures, IEEE Transactions on Computer, 22, 1, pp. 67-92, (1973); Holub A., Perona P., A discriminative framework for modelling object classes, CVPR, pages I, pp. 664-671, (2005); Ioffe S., Forsyth D., Probabilistic methods for finding people, IJCV, 43, 1, pp. 45-68, (2001); Jin Y., Geman S., Context and hierarchy in a probabilistic image model, CVPR, pages II, pp. 2145-2152, (2006); Joachims T., Making large-scale svm learning practical, Advances in Kernel Methods - Support Vector Learning, (1999); LeCun Y., Chopra S., Hadsell R., Marc'Aurelio R., Huang F., A tutorial on energy-based learning, Predicting Structured Data, (2006); Quattoni A., Wang S., Morency L., Collins M., Darrell T., Hidden conditional random fields, PAMI, 29, 10, pp. 1848-1852, (2007); Ramanan D., Using segmentation to verify object hypotheses, CVPR, pp. 1-8, (2007); Ramanan D., Sminchisescu C., Training deformable models for localization, CVPR, pages I, pp. 206-213, (2006); Schneiderman H., Kanade T., Object detection using the statistics of parts, IJCV, 56, 3, pp. 151-177, (2004); Zhang J., Marszalek M., Lazebnik S., Schmid C., Local features and kernels for classification of texture and object categories: A comprehensive study, IJCV, 73, 2, pp. 213-238, (2007)","P.

Our model uses an encoder LSTM to map an input sequence into a fixed length representation. This representation is decoded using single or multiple decoder LSTMs to perform different tasks, such as reconstructing the input sequence, or predicting the future sequence. We experiment with two kinds of input sequences-patches of image pixels and high-level representations (""percepts"") of video frames extracted using a pretrained convolutional net. We explore different design choices such as whether the decoder LSTMs should condition on the generated output. We analyze the outputs of the model qualitatively to see how well the model can extrapolate the learned video representation into the future and into the past. We further evaluate the representations by finetuning them for a supervised learning problem-human action recognition on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. We show that the representations help improve classification accuracy, especially when there are only few training examples. Even models pretrained on unrelated datasets (300 hours of YouTube videos) can help action recognition performance.","","Artificial intelligence; Decoding; Gesture recognition; Motion estimation; Video recording; Action recognition; Classification accuracy; Human-action recognition; Long short term memory; Supervised learning problems; Training example; Video representations; Video sequences; Learning systems","","","","","","","Cho K., Van Merrienboer B., Gulcehre C., Bahdanau D., Bougares F., Schwenk H., Bengio Y., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2014, pp. 1724-1734, (2014); Donahue J., Hendricks L.A., Guadarrama S., Rohrbach M., Venugopalan S., Saenko K., Darrell T., Long-term Recurrent Convo-lutional Networks for Visual Recognition and Description, (2014); Graves A., Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks, (2013); Graves A., Jaitly N., Towards end-to-end speech recognition with recurrent neural networks, Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning ICML-14, pp. 1764-1772, (2014); Gregor K., Danihelka I., Graves A., Wierstra D., DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network for Image Generation, (2015); Hurri J., Hyvarinen A., Simple-cell-like receptive fields maximize temporal coherence in natural video, Neural Computation, 15, 3, pp. 663-691, (2003); Ji S., Xu W., Yang M., Yu K., 3d con-volutional neural networks for human action recognition, Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 35, 1, pp. 221-231, (2013); Karpathy A., Toderici G., Shetty S., Leung T., Sukthankar R., Fei-Fei L., Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural net-t works, CVPR, (2014); Kingma D.P., Welling M., Auto-encoding Variational Bayes, (2013); Kuehne H., Jhuang H., Garrote E., Poggio T., Serre T., HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV, (2011); Lan Z.-Z., Lin M., Li X., Hauptmann A.G., Raj B., Beyond Gaussian Pyramid: Multi-skip Feature Stacking for Action Recognition, (2014); Le Q.V., Zou W., Yeung S.Y., Ng A.Y., Learning hierarchical spatio-temporal features for action recognition with independent subspace analysis, CVPR, (2011); Roland M., Learning to relate images, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 8, pp. 1829-1846, (2013); Memisevic R., Hinton G.E., Learning to represent spatial transformations with factored higher-order boltzmann machines, Neural Computation, 22, 6, pp. 1473-1492, (2010); Michalski V., Memisevic R., Konda K., Modeling deep temporal dependencies with recurrent grammar cells, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 27, pp. 1925-1933, (2014); Mobahi H., Collobert R., Weston J., Deep learning from temporal coherence in video, Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML '09, pp. 737-744, (2009); Ranzato M., Szlam A., Bruna J., Math-Ieu M., Collobert R., Chopra S., Video (Language) Modeling: A Baseline for Generative Models of Natural Videos, (2014); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Two-stream convolutional networks for action recognition in videos, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2014); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-scale Image Recognition, (2014); Soomro K., Roshan Zamir A., Shah M., UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild, CRCV-TR-12-01, (2012); Srivastava N., Mansimov E., Salakhutdinov R., Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations Using LSTMs, (2015); Susskind J., Memisevic R., Hinton G., Pollefeys M., Modeling the joint density of two images under a variety of transformations, Proceedings Of, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (2011); Sutskever I., Vinyals O., Le Q.V.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 27, pp. 3104-3112, (2014); Tran D., Bourdev L.D., Fergus R., Torresani L., Paluri M., C3D: Generic Features for Video Analysis, (2014); Van Hateren J.H., Ruderman D.L., Independent component analysis of natural image sequences yields spatio-temporal niters similar to simple cells in primary visual cortex, Proceedings.

The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function. This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.","","Artificial intelligence; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Action spaces; Actor-critic algorithm; Continuous actions; Exploratory behaviours; High-dimensional; Policy gradient; Stochastic policy; Value functions; Learning algorithms","","","","","Gatsby Charitable Foundation; Royal Society","","Bagnell J.A.D., Schneider J., Covariant policy search, Proceeding of the International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence, (2003); Bhatnagar S., Sutton R.S., Ghavamzadeh M., Lee M., Incremental natural actor-critic algorithms, Neural Information Processing Systems, 21, (2007); Degris T., Pilarski P.M., Sutton R.S., Model-free reinforcement learning with continuous action in practice, American Control Conference, (2012); Degris T., White M., Sutton R.S., Linear off-policy actor-critic, 29th International Conference on Machine Learning, (2012); Engel Y., Szabo P., Volkinshtein D., Learning to control an octopus arm with gaussian process temporal difference methods, Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, (2005); Hafner R., Riedmiller M., Reinforcement learning in feedback control, Machine Learning, 84, 1-2, pp. 137-169, (2011); Heess N., Silver D., Teh Y., Actor-critic reinforcement learning with energy-based policies, JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings: EWRL 2012, 24, pp. 43-58, (2012); Kakade S., A natural policy gradient, Neural Information Processing Systems, 14, pp. 1531-1538, (2001); Lagoudakis M.G., Parr R., Least-squares policy iteration, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 4, pp. 1107-1149, (2003); Maei H.R., Szepesvari C., Bhatnagar S., Sutton R.S., Toward off-policy learning control with function approximation, 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 719-726, (2010); Peters J., Policy gradient methods, Scholarpedia, 5, 11, (2010); Peters J., Vijayakumar S., Schaal S., Natural actor-critic, 16th European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 280-291, (2005); Sutton R., Barto A., Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction., (1998); Sutton R.S., Maei H.R., Precup D., Bhatnagar S., Silver D., Szepesvari C., Wiewiora E., Fast gradient-descent methods for temporal-difference learning with linear function approximation, 26th International Conference on Machine Learning, (2009); Sutton R.S., McAllester D.A., Singh S.R., Mansour Y., Policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning with function approximation, Neural Information Processing Systems, 12, pp. 1057-1063, (1999); Sutton R.S., Singh S.P., McAllester D.A., Comparing Policy-gradient Algorithms, (2000); Toussaint M., Some Notes on Gradient Descent, (2012); Watkins C., Dayan P., Q-learning, Machine Learning, 8, 3, pp. 279-292, (1992); Werbos P.J., A menu of designs for reinforcement learning over time, Neural Networks for Control, pp. 67-95, (1990); Williams R.J., Simple statistical gradientfollowing algorithms for connectionist reinforcement learning, Machine Learning, 8, pp. 229-256, (1992); Zhao T., Hachiya H., Niu G., Sugiyama M., Analysis and improvement of policy gradient estimation, Neural Networks, 26, pp. 118-129, (2012)","","","International Machine Learning Society (IMLS)","","31st International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2014","21 June 2014 through 26 June 2014","Beijing","109601","","978-163439397-3","","","English","Int.

In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms (""SPM2-type"" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

Often, such high-dimensional data lie close to low-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories to which the data belong. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called sparse subspace clustering, to cluster data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among the infinitely many possible representations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse representation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace. This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in a spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of the data into subspaces. Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the arrangement of the subspaces and the distribution of the data, the proposed minimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations. The proposed algorithm is efficient and can handle data points near the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal directly with data nuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries, by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motion segmentation and face clustering. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","(ℓ<sub>1</sub>)-minimization; clustering; convex programming; face clustering; High-dimensional data; intrinsic low-dimensionality; motion segmentation; principal angles; sparse representation; spectral clustering; subspaces","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Face; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sample Size; Convex programming; Optimization; Relaxation processes; clustering; Face clustering; High dimensional data; Low dimensionality; Motion segmentation; Principal angles; Sparse representation; Spectral clustering; subspaces; algorithm; anatomy and histology; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; face; human; procedures; sample size; article; automated pattern recognition; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; face; histology; methodology; Clustering algorithms","","","","","","","Bellman R.E., Dynamic Programming, (1957); Tomasi Carlo, Kanade Takeo, Shape and motion from image streams under orthography: A factorization method, International Journal of Computer Vision, 9, 2, pp. 137-154, (1992); Basri R., Jacobs D., Lambertian reflection and linear subspaces, IEEE Trans.

Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Often, however, we have plentiful labeled training data from a source domain but wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain with a different distribution and little or no labeled training data. In this work we investigate two questions. First, under what conditions can a classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on target data? Second, given a small amount of labeled target data, how should we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled source data to achieve the lowest target error at test time? We address the first question by bounding a classifier's target error in terms of its source error and the divergence between the two domains. We give a classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from finite, unlabeled samples from the domains. Under the assumption that there exists some hypothesis that performs well in both domains, we show that this quantity together with the empirical source error characterize the target error of a source-trained classifier. We answer the second question by bounding the target error of a model which minimizes a convex combination of the empirical source and target errors. Previous theoretical work has considered minimizing just the source error, just the target error, or weighting instances from the two domains equally. We show how to choose the optimal combination of source and target error as a function of the divergence, the sample sizes of both domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class. The resulting bound generalizes the previously studied cases and is always at least as tight as a bound which considers minimizing only the target error or an equal weighting of source and target errors. © The Author(s) 2009.","Domain adaptation; Learning theory; Sample-selection bias; Transfer learning","Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Convex combinations; Different distributions; Discriminative learning; Domain adaptation; Labeled training data; Learning Theory; Sample-selection bias; Transfer learning; Errors","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ITR 0428193, RI 0803256); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (NBCHD030010); University of Pennsylvania","Acknowledgements This material is based upon work partially supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. NBCHD030010 (CALO), by the National Science Foundation under grants ITR 0428193 and RI 0803256, and by a gift from Google, Inc. to the University of Pennsylvania.

However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the networks may cause learning complicated and inefficient, and it may be difficult to train networks with nondifferential activation functions such as threshold networks. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this paper proves in an incremental constructive method that in order to let SLFNs work as universal approximators, one may simply randomly choose hidden nodes and then only need to adjust the output weights linking the hidden layer and the output layer. In such SLFNs implementations, the activation functions for additive nodes can be any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous functions g : R → R and the activation functions for RBF nodes can be any integrable piecewise continuous functions g: R → R and ∫R g(χ) dχ ≠ 0. The proposed incremental method is efficient not only for SFLNs with continuous (including nondifferentiable) activation functions but also for SLFNs with piecewise continuous (such as threshold) activation functions. Compared to other popular methods such a new network is fully automatic and users need not intervene the learning process by manually tuning control parameters. © 2006 IEEE.","Ensemble; Feedforward network; Incremental extreme learning machine; Radial basis function; Random hidden nodes; Support vector machine; Threshold network; Universal approximation","Algorithms; Learning; Neural Networks (Computer); Statistics; Approximation theory; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Radial basis function networks; Random processes; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; learning; statistics; Incremental extreme learning machine; Random hidden nodes; Support vector machine; Threshold network; Universal approximation; Neural networks","","","","","","","Hornik K., Approximation capabilities of multilayer feedforward networks, Neural Netw., 4, pp. 251-257, (1991); Leshno M., Lin V.Y., Pinkus A., Schocken S., Multilayer feedforward networks with a nonpolynomial activation function can approximate any function, Neural Netw., 6, pp. 861-867, (1993); Park J., Sandberg I.W., Universal approximation using radial-basis-function networks, Neural Comput., 3, pp. 246-257, (1991); Huang G.-B., Babri H.A., Upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons in feedforward networks with arbitrary bounded nonlinear activation functions, IEEE Trans.

Mathews Ave., United States","Automated analysis of human affective behavior has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions despite the fact that deliberate behaviour differs in visual appearance, audio profile, and timing from spontaneously occurring behaviour. To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures. This paper introduces and surveys these recent advances. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next we examine available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior, and discuss important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data. We finally outline some of the scientific and engineering challenges to advancing human affect sensing technology. © 2009 IEEE.","Evaluation/methodology; Human-centered computing; Introductory and Survey","Affect; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Emotions; Facial Expression; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sound Spectrography; Surveys; affect; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; emotion; facial expression; methodology; monitoring; physiology; review; sound detection; Affect analysis; Affect recognitions; Affective behaviors; Audiovisual fusions; Automated analyses; Body gestures; Engineering challenges; Evaluation/methodology; Existing methods; Facial expressions; Head movements; Human emotions; Human-centered computing; Introductory and Survey; Machine understandings; Multimodal fusions; Sensing technologies; Training and tests; Visual appearances; Linguistics","","","","","EC FP7 Programme; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF 04-26627); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (203143, 211486); European Research Council, ERC","The authors would like to thank Qiang Ji and the anonymous reviewers for encouragement and valuable comments.

In this paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigen- vectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data- point. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outper- form the state-of-the art.","","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Laplace transforms; Semantics; Code-words; Datapoints; Graph Laplacian; Graph Partitioning; Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions; Laplacian eigenvectors; NP-hard; Semantic similarity; Simple++; Spectral methods; Hamming distance","","","","","","","Salakhutdinov R.R., Hinton G.E., Learning a nonlinear embedding by preserving class neighbourhood structure, AISTATS, (2007); Torralba A., Fergus R., Freeman W.T., Tiny images, Technical Report MIT-CSAIL-TR-2007-024, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, (2007); Torralba A., Fergus R., Weiss Y., Small codes and large databases for recognition, CVPR, (2008); Hays J., Efros A.A., Scene completion using millions of photographs, ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2007), 26, 3, (2007); Salakhutdinov R.R., Hinton G.E., Semantic hashing, SIGIR Workshop on Information Retrieval and Applications of Graphical Models, (2007); Belkin M., Niyogi P., Laplacian eigenmaps and spectral techniques for embedding and clustering, NIPS, pp. 585-591, (2001); Hinton G.E., Roweis S.T., Stochastic neighbor embedding, NIPS, pp. 833-840, (2002); Andoni A., Indyk P., Near-optimal hashing algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor in high dimensions, Proceedings - Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, pp. 459-468, (2006); Salakhutdinov R.R., Hinton G.E., Learning a nonlinear embedding by preserving class neighbourhood structure, AI and Statistics, (2007); Shakhnarovich G., Viola P., Darrell T., Fast pose estimation with parameter sensitive hashing, ICCV, (2003); Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Weiss Y., On spectral clustering, analysis and an algorithm, Advances in Neural Information Processing, 14, (2001); Shi J., Malik J., Normalized cuts and image segmentation, Proc.

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Radiology images","Betacoronavirus; Computational Biology; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Object detection; Viruses; Automated detection; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Devastating effects; Multi-class classification; Object detection systems; Radiological imaging; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial intelligence; binary classification; computer assisted diagnosis; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; feature extraction; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiclass classification; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; biology; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; pandemic; pneumonia; virus pneumonia; Deep neural networks","","","","","","","Wu F., Zhao S., Yu B., Et al., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China, Nature, 579, 7798, pp. 265-269, (2020); Huang C., Wang Y., Et al., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, Lancet, 395, 10223, pp. 497-506, (2020); World Health Organization, Pneumonia of Unknown Cause–China.

Basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: A large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used to estimate a subspace. Alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3D model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, PCA is used to estimate a subspace. Finally, images rendered from a 3D model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. In this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. More specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. Since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3D reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. We validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition. © 2005 IEEE.","Ambient lighting; Face recognition; Harmonic images; Harmonic subspaces; Illumination cone; Illumination subspaces","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Face; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Lighting; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photometry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; Approximation theory; Image processing; Lighting; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Polynomials; Principal component analysis; Theorem proving; Vectors; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; face; histology; human; illumination; image enhancement; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; photometry; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical model; validation study; Ambient lightning; Harmonic images; Harmonic subspaces; Illumination cone; Illumination subspaces; Face recognition","","","","","Honda Research Institute; US National Science Foundation, (CCR 00-86094, EIA 00-04056, IIS 00-85980); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01-EY 12691-01); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Eye Institute, NEI, (R01EY012691); National Eye Institute, NEI","The authors would like to thank David Jacobs for the discussion on harmonic lighting [2].

Description and recognition of DTs have attracted growing attention. In this paper, a novel approach for recognizing DTs is proposed and its simplifications and extensions to facial image analysis are also considered. First, the textures are modeled with volume local binary patterns (VLBP), which are an extension of the LBP operator widely used in ordinary texture analysis, combining motion and appearance. To make the approach computationally simple and easy to extend, only the co-occurrences of the local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) are then considered. A block-based method is also proposed to deal with specific dynamic events such as facial expressions in which local information and its spatial locations should also be taken into account. In experiments with two DT databases, DynTex and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), both the VLBP and LBP-TOP clearly outperformed the earlier approaches. The proposed block-based method was evaluated with the Cohn-Kanade facial expression database with excellent results. The advantages of our approach include local processing, robustness to monotonic gray-scale changes, and simple computation. © 2007 IEEE.","Facial expression; Facial image analysis; Local binary pattern; Motion; Temporal texture","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Computer Security; Face; Facial Expression; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Video Recording; Binary images; Computational methods; Database systems; Image analysis; Pattern matching; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; computer security; evaluation; face; facial expression; histology; human; image enhancement; methodology; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; videorecording; Block-based method; Dynamic texture; Volume local binary patterns; Face recognition","","","","","Academy of Finland","This work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland.

During the past decade, significant amount of progresses have been made toward this emerging machine learning paradigm. This paper aims to provide a timely review on this area with emphasis on state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms. Firstly, fundamentals on multi-label learning including formal definition and evaluation metrics are given. Secondly and primarily, eight representative multi-label learning algorithms are scrutinized under common notations with relevant analyses and discussions. Thirdly, several related learning settings are briefly summarized. As a conclusion, online resources and open research problems on multi-label learning are outlined for reference purposes. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","algorithm adaptation; label correlations-problem transformation; Multi-label learning","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Evaluation metrics; Formal definition; Learning paradigms; Learning settings; Multi-label learning; Online resources; Research problems; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Berger A.L., Della Pietra V.J., Della Pietra S.A., A maximum entropy approach to natural language processing, Comput.

Training of the models was performed with the use of an open database of 87,848 images, containing 25 different plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, including healthy plants. Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance reaching a 99.53% success rate in identifying the corresponding [plant, disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly high success rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early warning tool, and an approach that could be further expanded to support an integrated plant disease identification system to operate in real cultivation conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Plant disease identification","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Cultivation; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Plants (botany); Convolutional neural network; Cultivation conditions; Early warning; Integrated plants; Learning models; Model architecture; Plant disease; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; database; detection method; disease; early warning system; identification method; integrated approach; machine learning; methodology; numerical model; pattern recognition; plant; Deep learning","","","","","","","Carranza-Rojas J., Goeau H., Bonnet P., Mata-Montero E., Joly A., Going deeper in the automated identification of Herbarium specimens, BMC Evol.

Outliers arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used, drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics. In this paper, we introduce a survey of contemporary techniques for outlier detection. We identify their respective motivations and distinguish their advantages and disadvantages in a comparative review.","Anomaly; Detection; Deviation; Noise; Novelty; Outlier; Recognition","Algorithms;

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Explainability; Explainable AI; Explanation; Interpretability; Transparency","Transparency; Cognitive psychology; Cognitive science; Explainability; Explanation; Human observers; Interpretability; Social expectations; Social psychology; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Université de Toulouse Capitole; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP160104083); State Government of Victoria; Defence Science and Technology Group, DST Group; Defence Science Institute, DSI","Funding text 1: This work was undertaken while the author was on sabbatical at the Université de Toulouse Capitole, and was partially funded by Australian Research Council DP160104083 Catering for individuals' emotions in technology development and a Sponsored Research Collaboration grant from the Commonwealth of Australia Defence Science and Technology Group and the Defence Science Institute, an initiative of the State Government of Victoria.; Funding text 2: This work was undertaken while the author was on sabbatical at the Université de Toulouse Capitole, and was partially funded by Australian Research Council DP160104083 Catering for individuals' emotions in technology development and a Sponsored Research Collaboration grant from the Commonwealth of Australia Defence Science and Technology Group and the Defence Science Institute , an initiative of the State Government of Victoria.","Allemang D., Tanner M.C., Bylander T., Josephson J.R., Computational complexity of hypothesis assembly, IJCAI, 87, pp. 1112-1117, (1987); Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine bias, ProPublica, (2016); Antaki C., Leudar I., Explaining in conversation: towards an argument model, Eur.

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.","artificial intelligence; computers; prognosis; risk factors; statistics","Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Medicine; Article; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; medical information; priority journal; algorithm; machine learning; medicine; trends","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (U01HL107440); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (K08HL098361)","","Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning, (2009); Abu-Mostafa Y.S., Magdon-Ismail M., Lin H.T., Learning from Data, (2012); Kannel W.B., Doyle J.T., McNamara P.M., Quickenton P., Gordon T., Precursors of sudden coronary death.

Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters’ influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Deep learning; Human activity recognition; LSTM; Machine learning; Neural network; Sensor fusion; Wearable sensors","Clothing; Databases, Factual; Human Activities; Humans; Machine Learning; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Neural Networks (Computer); Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Convolution; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; Wearable technology; Activity recognition; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; Improve performance; LSTM; Recurrent networks; Sensor fusion; ambulatory monitoring; artificial neural network; classification; clothing; factual database; human; human activities; machine learning; procedures; signal processing; Wearable sensors","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N007816/1)","","Rashidi P., Cook D.J., The resident in the loop: Adapting the smart home to the user, IEEE Trans.

We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically defined in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents. ©2004 AI Access Foundation.

Short tutorial descriptions of each ML/DM method are provided. Based on the number of citations or the relevance of an emerging method, papers representing each method were identified, read, and summarized. Because data are so important in ML/DM approaches, some well-known cyber data sets used in ML/DM are described. The complexity of ML/DM algorithms is addressed, discussion of challenges for using ML/DM for cyber security is presented, and some recommendations on when to use a given method are provided. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","Cyber Analytics; Data Mining; Machine Learning","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Surveys; Cyber Analytics; Cyber security; Literature survey; Machine learning methods; Learning systems","","","","","","","Mukkamala A., Sung A., Abraham A., Cyber security challenges: Designing efficient intrusion detection systems and antivirus tools, Enhancing Computer Security with Smart Technology, pp. 125-163, (2005); Bhuyan M., Bhattacharyya D., Kalita J., Network anomaly detection: Methods, systems and tools, IEEE Commun.

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70% versus 12%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.","","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Artificial Intelligence; Cyclophosphamide; Doxorubicin; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Diffuse; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Prednisone; Treatment Outcome; Vincristine; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; prednisone; protein serine threonine kinase; vincristine; adult; apoptosis; article; B cell lymphoma; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer survival; enzyme phosphorylation; gene expression; human; human tissue; machine; major clinical study; outcomes research; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; signal transduction","","CHOP protocol, ; Cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; Doxorubicin, 23214-92-8; Prednisone, 53-03-2; Vincristine, 57-22-7","","","Bristol–Myers Squibb","Acknowledgments We thank members of the Center for Genome Research and members of the Shipp and Aster laboratories for technical assistance and helpful comments.

VFDT can incorporate tens of thousands of examples per second using off-the-shelf hardware. It uses Hoeffding bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner.

We introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. This is used within a framework whereby the alignment algorithms are described in terms of their underlying model, to allow automated development of efficient heuristic implementations which may be applied to a general set of sequence comparison problems.

For graph-based semi-supervised learning, a recent important development is graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which nicely integrate local vertex features and graph topology in the convolutional layers. Although the GCN model compares favorably with other state-of-the-art methods, its mechanisms are not clear and it still requires considerable amount of labeled data for validation and model selection. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the GCN model and address its fundamental limits. First, we show that the graph convolution of the GCN model is actually a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which is the key reason why GCNs work, but it also brings potential concerns of over-smoothing with many convolutional layers. Second, to overcome the limits of the GCN model with shallow architectures, we propose both co-training and self-training approaches to train GCNs. Our approaches significantly improve GCNs in learning with very few labels, and exempt them from requiring additional labels for validation. Extensive experiments on benchmarks have verified our theory and proposals. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space - classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm -using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.","Convex optimization; Kernel methods;

We survey the current status of AI applications in healthcare and discuss its future. AI can be applied to various types of healthcare data (structured and unstructured). Popular AI techniques include machine learning methods for structured data, such as the classical support vector machine and neural network, and the modern deep learning, as well as natural language processing for unstructured data. Major disease areas that use AI tools include cancer, neurology and cardiology.

In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent convolutional neural network for text classification without human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. We conduct experiments on four commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, particularly on document-level datasets. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaa1.org).

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial 'machine learning as a service' providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies. © 2017 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Classification models; Classification tasks; Hospital discharge; Inference attacks; Inference techniques; Machine learning models; Mitigation strategy; Training dataset; Education","","","","","","","Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., McMahan H.B., Mironov I., Talwar K., Zhang L., Deep learning with differential privacy, CCS, (2016); Ateniese G., Mancini L.V., Spognardi A., Villani A., Vitali D., Felici G., Hacking smart machines with smarter ones: How to extract meaningful data from machine learning classifiers, International Journal of Security and Networks, 10, 3, pp. 137-150, (2015); Backes M., Berrang P., Humbert M., Manoharan P., Membership privacy in MicroRNA-based studies, CCS, (2016); Barni M., Failla P., Lazzeretti R., Sadeghi A., Schneider T., Privacypreserving ECG classification with branching programs and neural networks, Trans.

We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully. © 2006 IEEE.","Few images; Learning; Object categories; Priors; Recognition; Unsupervised; Variational inference","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Database systems; Image processing; Learning algorithms; Mathematical models; Maximum likelihood estimation; Parameter estimation; Probability density function; Variational techniques; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; Bayes theorem; biological model; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods; Object categories; Posterior model; Variational inference; Object recognition","","","","","Caltech CNSE; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; European Commission, EC","The authors would like to thank Andrew Zisserman, David Mackay, Brian Ripley, and Joel Lindop.

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","introductory; machine learning; Multimodal; survey","Artificial intelligence; Flow visualization; Hidden Markov models; Media streaming; Multimedia systems; Speech; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Surveying; Surveys; Taxonomies; introductory; Media; Multi-media communications; Multi-modal; Streaming media; Learning systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1722822); National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST","A second important category of multimodal applications comes from the field of multimedia content indexing and retrieval [11], [196]. With the advance of personal computers and the internet, the quantity of digitized multimedia content has increased dramatically [2]. While earlier approaches for indexing and searching these multimedia videos were keyword-based [196], new research problems emerged when trying to search the visual and multimodal content directly. This led to new research topics in multimedia content analysis such as automatic shot-boundary detection [128] and video summarization [55]. These research projects were supported by the TrecVid initiative from the National Institute of Standards and Technologies which introduced many high-quality datasets, including the multimedia event detection (MED) tasks started in 2011 [1].","(2017); (2016); Agrawal A., Batra D., Parikh D., Analyzing the behavior of visual question answering models, Proc.

In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually. This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.","2D foot keypoint estimation; 2D human pose estimation; multiple person; part affinity fields; real-time","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Key-point detectors; Location estimation; Multiple people; Nonparametric representation; Number of peoples; Pose estimation; Real time performance; Run-time performance; adult; article; face; female; foot; human; human experiment; male; running; Open systems","","","","","Interior Business Center, IBC; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, IARPA; U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI; U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI; Idaho Beef Council, IBC, (D17PC00340)","We acknowledge the effort from the authors of the MPII and COCO human pose datasets.

How can computer vision researchers exploit this imagery? This paper explores this question from the standpoint of 3D scene modeling and visualization. We present structure-from-motion and image-based rendering algorithms that operate on hundreds of images downloaded as a result of keyword-based image search queries like ""Notre Dame"" or ""Trevi Fountain."" This approach, which we call Photo Tourism, has enabled reconstructions of numerous well-known world sites. This paper presents these algorithms and results as a first step towards 3D modeling of the world's well-photographed sites, cities, and landscapes from Internet imagery, and discusses key open problems and challenges for the research community. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","3D navigation; 3D scene analysis; Internet imagery; Photo browsers; Structure from motion","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Imaging techniques; Internet; Photography; Research; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-D modeling; 3D navigation; 3D scene analysis; 3D scenes; Image search; Image-based-rendering; Internet imagery; Open problems; Photo browsers; Photo collections; Research communities; Special sections; Structure from motion; Three dimensional","","","","","DeGanta Choudhury; National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH","Holly Ables, of Nashville, TN Rakesh Agrawal Pedro Alcocer Julien Avarre (http://www.flickr.com/photos/eole/) Rael Bennett (http://www.flickr.com/photos/spooky05/) Loïc Bernard Nicole Bratt Nicholas Brown Domenico Calojero (mikuzz@gmail.com) DeGanta Choudhury (http://www.flickr.com/photos/ deganta/) dan clegg Claude Covo-Farchi Alper Çug˘un W.

In this paper, we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion. © 2012 National Research Council Canada.","affect; crowdsourcing; emotion lexicon; emotions; Mechanical Turk; polarity; polarity lexicon; semantic orientation; sentiment analysis; word-emotion associations","Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; affect; Crowdsourcing; emotion lexicon; emotions; Mechanical turks; polarity; polarity lexicon; Semantic orientation; Sentiment analysis; Semantics","","","","","","","Adamic L.A., Zhang J., Bakshy E., Ackerman M.S., Knowledge sharing and Yahoo answers: Everyone knows something, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW '08, pp. 665-674, (2008); Alm C.O., Roth D., Sproat R., Emotions from text: Machine learning for text-based emotion prediction, Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Human Language Technology/Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (HLT/EMNLP-2005), pp. 579-586, (2005); Aman S., Szpakowicz S., Identifying expressions of emotion in text, Text, Speech and Dialogue, pp. 196-205, (2007); Physiognomonica, The Works of Aristotle, pp. 805-813, (1913); Bellegarda J., Emotion analysis using latent affective folding and embedding, Proceedings of the NAACL-HLT 2010 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Analysis and Generation of Emotion in Text, (2010); The Macquarie Thesaurus.

Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers 1.73× communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98× expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear. © 2017 author(s).","Federated Learning; Machine Learning; Privacy-Preserving Protocols; Secure Aggregation","Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Network security; Communication overheads; Complexity analysis; Federated Learning; High dimensional data; Learning settings; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving protocols; Secure aggregations; Data privacy","","","","","","","Abadi M., Chu A., Goodfellow I., Brendan McMahan H., Mironov I., Talwar K., Zhang L., Deep learning with differential privacy, Proceedings of the 2016 ACMSIGSAC Conference On Computer and Communications Security ACM, pp. 308-318, (2016); Abdalla M., Bellare M., Rogaway P., The oracle Diffie-Hellman assumptions and an analysis of DHIES, Cryptographers' Track at the RSA Conference, pp. 143-158, (2001); Acs G., Castelluccia C., I have a DREAM!

In the last two decades, a huge number of methods were proposed to deal with the hyperspectral data classification problem. However, most of them do not hierarchically extract deep features. In this paper, the concept of deep learning is introduced into hyperspectral data classification for the first time. First, we verify the eligibility of stacked autoencoders by following classical spectral information-based classification. Second, a new way of classifying with spatial-dominated information is proposed. We then propose a novel deep learning framework to merge the two features, from which we can get the highest classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principle component analysis (PCA), deep learning architecture, and logistic regression. Specifically, as a deep learning architecture, stacked autoencoders are aimed to get useful high-level features. Experimental results with widely-used hyperspectral data indicate that classifiers built in this deep learning-based framework provide competitive performance.

Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea is to decompose the space into a Cartesian product of low-dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. A vector is represented by a short code composed of its subspace quantization indices. The euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes. An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy, outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a data set of two billion vectors. © 2006 IEEE.","approximate search; High-dimensional indexing; image indexing; very large databases","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Image retrieval; Indexing (of information); Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search; approximate search; Cartesian Products; Data sets; Euclidean distance; High-dimensional indexing; Image descriptors; Image indexing; Inverted files; Low-dimensional subspace; Nearest Neighbor search; Nearest neighbors; Quantization index; Search accuracy; Short codes; State-of-the-art approach; Very large database; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; image processing; information retrieval; methodology; statistical model; Vectors","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","The authors would like to thank the search engine project QUAERO as well as the ANR project GAIA for their financial support.","Beyer K., Goldstein J., Ramakrishnan R., Shaft U., When is 'nearest neighbor' meaningful?, Proc.

We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input. © 2016 by the author(s).","","Artificial intelligence;

Association rule mining finds all the rules existing in the database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. For association rule mining, the target of discovery is not pre-determined, while for classification rule mining there is one and only one predetermined target. In this paper, we propose to integrate these two mining techniques. The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs). An efficient algorithm is also given for building a classifier based on the set of discovered CARs. Experimental results show that the classifier built this way is, in general, more accurate than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5. In addition, this integration helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems. Copyright © 1998, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In existing methods, while ℓn-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box regression, it is not tailored to the evaluation metric, i.e., Intersection over Union (IoU). Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box and the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU losses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding box regression, i.e., overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio, based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster R-CNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting performance improvement. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers-also known as viral marketing-can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.","","Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Learning systems; Marketing; Markov processes; Dependency networks; Data mining","","","","","","","Barabasi A.L., Albert R., Jong H., Scale-free characteristics of random networks: The topology of the World Wide Web, Physics A, 281, pp. 69-77, (2000); Besag J., Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice systems, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 36, pp. 192-236, (1974); Breese J.S., Heckerman D., Kadie C., Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering, Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, (1998); Brin S., Page L., The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine, Proceedings of the Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, (1998); Cestnik B., Estimating probabilities: A crucial task in machine learning, Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 147-149, (1990); Chakrabarti S., Dom B., Indyk P., Enhanced hypertext categorization using hyperlinks, Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 307-318, (1998); Chellappa R., Jain A.K., Markov Random Fields: Theory and Application, (1993); Chickering D.M., Heckerman D., A decision theoretic approach to targeted advertising, Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, (2000); Cook D.J., Holder L.B., Graph-based data mining, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 15, pp. 32-41, (2000); Cooper G.F., A simple constraint-based algorithm for efficiently mining observational databases for causal relationships, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 1, pp. 203-224, (1997); Domingos P., Pazzani M., On the optimality of the simple Bayesian classifier under zero-one loss, Machine Learning, 29, pp. 103-130, (1997); Dye R., The buzz on buzz, Harvard Business Review, 78, 6, pp. 139-146, (2000); Flake G.W., Lawrence S., Giles C.L., Efficient identification of Web communities, Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 150-160, (2000); Friedman N., Getoor L., Koller D., Pfeffer A., Learning probabilistic relational models, Proceedings of the Sixteenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1300-1307, (1999); Gelbrich K., Nakhaeizadeh R., Value miner: A data mining environment for the calculation of the customer lifetime value with application to the automotive industry, Proceedings of the Eleventh European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 154-161, (2000); Geman S., Geman D., Stochastic relaxation, Gibbs distributions, and the Bayesian restoration of images, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine intelligence, 6, pp. 721-741, (1984); Heckerman D., Chickering D.M., Meek C., Rounthwaite R., Kadie C., Dependency networks for inference, collaborative filtering, and data visualization, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 1, pp. 49-75, (2000); Herlocker J., Konstan J., Botchers A., Riedl J., An algorithmic framework for performing collaborative filtering, Proceedings of the 1999 Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, (1999); Hughes A.M., The Complete Database Marketer: Second-Generation Strategies and Techniques for Tapping the Power of Your Customer Database, (1996); Iacobucci D., Networks in Marketing, (1996); Isbell C.L.

Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Neoplasms; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiology; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automation; cancer screening; cancer staging; clinical practice; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; expert system; human; lung cancer; machine learning; mammography; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncology; positron emission tomography; priority journal; procedures; prognosis; quantitative analysis; radiologist; radiology; Review; risk assessment; signal noise ratio; speech discrimination; treatment planning; workflow; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; diagnostic imaging; image processing; neoplasm","","","","","NIH-USA, (U01CA190234); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (U24CA194354)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH-USA U24CA194354 and NIH-USA U01CA190234).","Editors N., Auspicious machine learning, Nat.

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images.","Boundary detection; Boundary localization; Cue combination; Ground truth segmentation data set; Natural images; Supervised learning; Texture","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Color; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; User-Computer Interface; Color; Image analysis; Image quality; Image segmentation; Textures; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; color; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer interface; evaluation; image enhancement; image subtraction; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; validation study; Boundary localization; Cue combination; Supervised learning; Pattern recognition","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-01-1-0890); University of California Berkeley, UCB; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI","The authors would like to thank the Berkeley Computer Vision Group, in particular Xiaofeng Ren.

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective. © 2018 author(s).","Explanations; Interpretability; Open The Black Box; Transparent Models","Artificial intelligence; Surveys; Black box system; Black boxes; Black-box model; Decision systems; Explanations; Interpretability; Problem definition; Specific problems; Decision support systems","","","","","European Community’s H2020 Program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (654024)","This work is partially supported by the European Community’s H2020 Program under the funding scheme “INFRAIA-1-2014-2015: Research Infrastructures,” Grant Agreement No. 654024, SoBigData, http://www.sobigdata.eu.

It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarize the results from the key game and nongame domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work. © 2009 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); bandit-based methods; computer Go; game search; Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS); upper confidence bounds (UCB); upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT)","Surveys; bandit-based methods; computer Go; game search; MONTE CARLO; Upper confidence bound; Artificial intelligence","","","","","University of Essex; University of Bradford; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/H048588/1, EP/H049061/1, EP/H049061/2, EP/I001964/1)","Funding text 1: Manuscript received October 22, 2011; revised January 12, 2012; accepted January 30, 2012.

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the -alphabet- used to describe those systems.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Mathematical Concepts; Nonlinear Dynamics; Physical Processes; Regression Analysis; Software; algorithm; automation; bootstrapping; computer; experimental study; identification method; kinematics; article; geometry; kinematics; mathematical model; motion; natural science; oscillator; physics; priority journal; theoretical model","","","","","","","Anderson P.W., Science, 177, (1972); Noether E., Nachr. d.

It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture that corresponds closely to the biological system. The model is cyclic with 7 types of states for helix core, helix caps on either side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in the middle of each loop. The two loop paths on the non-cytoplasmic side are used to model short and long loops separately, which corresponds biologically to the two known different membrane insertions mechanisms. The close mapping between the biological and computational states allows us to infer which parts of the model architecture are important to capture the information that encodes the membrane topology, and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and constraints involved. Models were estimated both by maximum likelihood and a discriminative method, and a method for reassignment of the membrane helix boundaries were developed. In a cross validated test on single sequences, our transmembrane HMM, TMHMM, correctly predicts the entire topology for 77% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology. The same accuracy was achieved on a larger dataset of 160 proteins. These results compare favourably with existing methods.","","Amino Acid Sequence; Artificial Intelligence; Databases, Factual; Markov Chains; Membrane Proteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Structure, Secondary; membrane protein; amino acid sequence; article; artificial intelligence; chemical structure; chemistry; factual database; genetics; molecular genetics; probability; protein secondary structure","","Membrane Proteins, ","","","","","","E.L.

Spark has a programming model similar to MapReduce but extends it with a data-sharing abstraction called 'Resilient Distributed Datasets,' or RDDs.25 Using this simple extension, Spark can capture a wide range of processing workloads that previously needed separate engines, including SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. Spark evaluates RDDs lazily, allowing it to find an efficient plan for the user's computation. In particular, transformations return a new RDD object representing the result of a computation but do not immediately compute it. When an action is called, Spark looks at the whole graph of transformations used to create an execution plan. Spark Streaming implements incremental stream processing using a model called discretized streams. MLlib, Spark's machine learning library, implements more than 50 common algorithms for distributed model training. Spark's most common applications are for batch processing on large datasets, including Extract-Transform-Load workloads to convert data from a raw format to a more structured format and offline training of machine learning models.","","Artificial intelligence; Batch data processing; Data handling; Engines; Learning systems; Distributed data processing; Distributed modeling; Extract transform loads; Machine learning models; Off-line training; Programming models; Stream processing; University of California , Berkeley; Big data","","","","","SAP; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-1139158); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (FA8750-12-2-0331); Intel Corporation; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; Microsoft; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, LBNL, (7076018); Google; Amazon Web Services, AWS; VMware","Apache Spark is the work of hundreds of open source contributors who are credited in the release notes at https://spark.apache.org.

In this paper, we focus on the use of nonparametric statistical inference for analyzing the results obtained in an experiment design in the field of computational intelligence. We present a case study which involves a set of techniques in classification tasks and we study a set of nonparametric procedures useful to analyze the behavior of a method with respect to a set of algorithms, such as the framework in which a new proposal is developed. Particularly, we discuss some basic and advanced nonparametric approaches which improve the results offered by the Friedman test in some circumstances. A set of post hoc procedures for multiple comparisons is presented together with the computation of adjusted p-values. We also perform an experimental analysis for comparing their power, with the objective of detecting the advantages and disadvantages of the statistical tests described. We found that some aspects such as the number of algorithms, number of data sets and differences in performance offered by the control method are very influential in the statistical tests studied. Our final goal is to offer a complete guideline for the use of nonparametric statistical procedures for performing multiple comparisons in experimental studies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

With advances in computer technology, text analysis allows researchers to reliably and quickly assess features of what people say as well as subtleties in their linguistic styles. Following a brief review of several text analysis programs, we summarize some of the evidence that links natural word use to personality, social and situational fluctuations, and psychological interventions. Of particular interest are findings that point to the psychological value of studying particles - parts of speech that include pronouns, articles, prepositions, conjunctives, and auxiliary verbs. Particles, which serve as the glue that holds nouns and regular verbs together, can serve as markers of emotional state, social identity, and cognitive styles.","Artificial intelligence; Discourse; LIWC; Particles; Pronouns; Text analysis","Artificial Intelligence; Emotions; Health Status; Humans; Individuality; Interpersonal Relations; Mental Health; Natural Language Processing; Personality; Psycholinguistics; Semantics; Social Environment; Verbal Behavior; artificial intelligence; emotion; health status; human; human relation; individuality; linguistics; mental health; natural language processing; personality; review; semantics; social environment; verbal behavior","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH, (R01MH052391)","","Acitelli L., You, me, and us: Perspectives on relationship awareness, Understanding Relationship Processes, Vol. 1.

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations. © 2018 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Algorithm complexity analysis; Machine learning; Noise reduction methods; Numerical optimization; Second-order methods; Stochastic gradient methods","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational complexity; Deep neural networks; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Noise abatement; Nonlinear programming; Numerical methods; Stochastic systems; Text processing; Algorithm complexity; Noise reduction methods; Numerical optimizations; Second-order methods; Stochastic gradient methods; Learning algorithms","","","","","U.S. National Science Foundation, (DMS-1016291); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-14-1-0313 P00003); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-FG02-87ER25047s, DE-SC0010615); Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MPS, (1016291)","∗Received by the editors June 16, 2016; accepted for publication (in revised form) April 19, 2017; published electronically May 8, 2018. http://www.siam.org/journals/sirev/60-2/M108017.html Funding: The work of the second author was supported by U.S. Department of Energy grant DE-SC0010615 and U.S. National Science Foundation grant DMS-1016291.

Given a small number of pixels with user-defined (or predefined) labels, one can analytically and quickly determine the probability that a random walker starting at each unlabeled pixel will first reach one of the prelabeled pixels. By assigning each pixel to the label for which the greatest probability is calculated, a high-quality image segmentation may be obtained. Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs. © 2006 IEEE.","Boundary completion; Combinatorial Dirichlet problem; Graph cuts; Graph theory; Harmonic functions; Image segmentation; Interactive segmentation; Laplace equation; Random walks","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Combinatorial mathematics; Graph theory; Harmonic analysis; Image quality; Laplace equation; Pixels; Probability; Random processes; Boundary completion; Combinatorial Dirichlet problem; Harmonic functions; Interactive segmentation; Random walks; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Image segmentation","","","","","","","Grady L., Funka-Lea G., Multi-Label Image Segmentation for Medical Applications Based on Graph-Theoretic Electrical Potentials, Proc.

The problem is to find the possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm well-suited for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-and-test framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been demonstrated at major conferences.","Camera calibration; Ego-motion estimation; Imaging geometry; Motion; Relative orientation; Scene reconstruction; Structure from motion","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Algorithms; Cameras; Computational complexity; Image reconstruction; Polynomials; Real time systems; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; methodology; photography; three dimensional imaging; Camera calibration; Ego motion estimation; Imaging geometry; Relative orientation; Scene reconstruction; Structure from motion; Motion estimation","","","","","Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (DAAD19-01-2-0012)","This paper was prepared through a collaborative participation in the Robotics Consortium sponsored by the US Army Research Laboratory under the Collaborative Technology Alliance Program, Cooperative Agreement DAAD19-01-2-0012.

Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark datasets like NORB and CIFAR by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms and deep models. In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors, such as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more important to achieving high performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically, we will apply several off-the- shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders, sparse RBMs, K-means clustering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR, NORB, and STL datasets using only singlelayer networks. We then present a detailed analysis of the effect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size, number of hidden nodes (features), the step-size (""stride"") between extracted features, and the effect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense feature extraction are critical to achieving high performance-so critical, in fact, that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means clustering, which is extremely fast, has no hyper-parameters to tune beyond the model structure itself, and is very easy to implement. Despite the simplicity of our system, we achieve accuracy beyond all previously published results on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6% and 97.2% respectively).

For example, our proposed technique stores, for each pixel, a set of values taken in the past at the same location or in the neighborhood. It then compares this set to the current pixel value in order to determine whether that pixel belongs to the background, and adapts the model by choosing randomly which values to substitute from the background model. This approach differs from those based upon the classical belief that the oldest values should be replaced first. Finally, when the pixel is found to be part of the background, its value is propagated into the background model of a neighboring pixel. We describe our method in full details (including pseudo-code and the parameter values used) and compare it to other background subtraction techniques. Efficiency figures show that our method outperforms recent and proven state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computation speed and detection rate. We also analyze the performance of a downscaled version of our algorithm to the absolute minimum of one comparison and one byte of memory per pixel. It appears that even such a simplified version of our algorithm performs better than mainstream techniques. © 2010 IEEE.","Background subtraction; computer vision; image motion analysis; image segmentation; learning (artificial intelligence); pixel classification; real-time systems; surveillance; video signal processing; vision and scene understanding","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; Video Recording; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Models; Real time systems; Signal processing; Video recording; Background subtraction; Image motion analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); pixel classification; surveillance; vision and scene understanding; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; image subtraction; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; videorecording; Pixels","","","","","","","Barnich O., Van Droogenbroeck M., ViBe: A powerful random technique to estimate the background in video sequences, Proc.

To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name ""forest."" Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the Rotation Forest ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and compared it with Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forest. The results were favorable to Rotation Forest and prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that Rotation Forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and Random Forest, and more diverse than these in Bagging, sometimes more accurate as well. © 2006 IEEE.","AdaBoost; Bagging; Classifier ensembles; Feature extraction; Kappa-error diagrams; PCA; Random forest","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Computer Simulation; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Statistical; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Data reduction; Decision trees; Error analysis; Feature extraction; Principal component analysis; Random processes; AdaBoost; Bagging; Classifier ensembles; Kappa-error diagrams; Random forest; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; cluster analysis; comparative study; computer simulation; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; principal component analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Classification (of information)","","","","","Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture, (DPI2005-08498); Universidad de Burgos, UBU; Junta de Castilla y León, JCYL, (VA088A05)","The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their comments.

We propose Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of texts in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia. We use machine learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as a weighted vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments: from r = 0.56 to 0.75 for individual words and from r = 0.60 to 0.72 for texts. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users.","","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Vector spaces; Explicit semantic analysis; High dimensional spaces; Human judgments; Machine learning techniques; Natural language text; Semantic relatedness; State of the art; World knowledge; Semantics","","","","","","","Baeza-Yates R., Ribeiro-Neto B., Modern Information Retrieval, (1999); Banerjee S., Pedersen T., Extended gloss overlaps as a measure of semantic relatedness, IJCAI, pp. 805-810, (2003); Buchanan B.G., Feigenbaum E.A., Forward, Knowledge-Based Systems in Artificial Intelligence, (1982); Budanitsky A., Hirst G., Evaluating wordnet-based measures of lexical semantic relatedness, Computational Linguistics, 32, 1, pp. 13-47, (2006); Dagan I., Lee L., Pereira F.C.N., Similarity-based models of word cooccurrence probabilities, Machine Learning, 34, 1-3, pp. 43-69, (1999); Deerwester S., Dumais S., Furnas G., Landauer T., Harshman R., Indexing by latent semantic analysis, JASIS, 41, 6, pp. 391-407, (1990); Fellbaum C., WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, (1998); Finkelstein L., Gabrilovich E., Matias Y., Rivlin E., Solan Z., Wolfman G., Ruppin E., Placing search in context: The concept revisited, ACM TOIS, 20, 1, pp. 116-131, (2002); Gabrilovich E., Markovitch S., Feature generation for text categorization using world knowledge, IJCAI'05, pp. 1048-1053, (2005); Gabrilovich E., Markovitch S., Overcoming the brittleness bottleneck using Wikipedia: Enhancing text categorization with encyclopedic knowledge, AAAI' 06, pp. 1301-1306, (2006); Gabrilovich E., Feature Generation for Textual Information Retrieval Using World Knowledge; Giles J., Internet encyclopaedias go head to head, Nature, 438, pp. 900-901, (2005); Grefenstette G., SEXTANT: Exploring unexplored contexts for semantic extraction from syntactic analysis, ACL'92, pp. 324-326, (1992); Han E.-H., Karypis G., Centroid-based document classification: Analysis and experimental results, PKDD'00, (2000); Jarmasz M., Roget's Thesaurus As a Lexical Resource for Natural Language Processing, (2003); Jiang J.J., Conrath D.W., Semantic similarity based on corpus statistics and lexical taxonomy, ROCLING'97, (1997); Lee M.D., Pincombe B., Welsh M., An empirical evaluation of models of text document similarity, CogSci2005, pp. 1254-1259, (2005); Lee L., Measures of distributional similarity, Proceedings of the 37th Annual Meeting of the ACL, 1999; Lenat D., Guha R., Building Large Knowledge Based Systems, (1990); Lin D., An information-theoretic definition of word similarity, ICML' 98, (1998); Mihalcea R., Corley C., Strapparava C., Corpus-based and knowledge-based measures of text semantic similarity, AAAI'06, (2006); Miller G.A., Charles W.G., Contextual correlates of semantic similarity, Language and Cognitive Processes, 6, 1, pp. 1-28, (1991); Resnik P., Semantic similarity in a taxonomy: An information-based measure and its application to problems of ambiguity in natural language, JAIR, 11, pp. 95-130, (1999); Roget P., Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, (1852); Rubenstein H., Goodenough J.B., Contextual correlates of synonymy, Communications of the ACM, 8, 10, pp. 627-633, (1965); Sahami M., Heilman T., A web-based kernel function for measuring the similarity of short text snippets, WWW'06, (2006); Salton G., McGill M.J., An Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval, (1983); Sebastiani F., Machine learning in automated text categorization, ACM Comp.

This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of Sequential Floating Forward Search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.","Affective computing; Emotion recognition; Emotional intelligence; Feature selection; Fisher Projection; Physiological patterns","Algorithms; Feature extraction; Physiology; Emotional intelligence; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Damasio A.R., Descartes, Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, (1994); LeDoux J., The Emotional Brain, (1996); Salovey P., Mayer J.D., Emotional intelligence, Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 9, 3, pp. 185-211, (1990); Goleman D., Emotional Intelligence, (1995); Reeves B., Nass C., The Media Equation, (1996); Sigman M., Capps L., Children with Autism: A Developmental Perspective, (1997); Picard R.W., Affective Computing, (1997); Healey J., Picard R.W., Dabek F., A new affect-perceiving interface and its application to personalized music selection, Proc.

Here we show that support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis extracts sufficient information from fcMRI data to make accurate predictions about individuals' brain maturity across development. The use of only 5 minutes of resting-state fcMRI data from 238 scans of typically developing volunteers (ages 7 to 30 years) allowed prediction of individual brain maturity as a functional connectivity maturation index. The resultant functional maturation curve accounted for 55% of the sample variance and followed a nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape. The greatest relative contribution to predicting individual brain maturity was made by the weakening of short-range functional connections between the adult brain's major functional networks.

However, recent studies have shown thatdeep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force adeep neural network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attackscan seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles canbe crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometricauthentication systems can be manipulated to allow improper access. In thiswork, we introduce a defensive mechanism called defensive distillationto reduce the effectiveness of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analyticallyinvestigate the generalizability and robustness properties granted by the useof defensive distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study theeffectiveness of our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarialsettings. The study shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectivenessof sample creation from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramaticgains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used inadversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 1030. We alsofind that distillation increases the average minimum number of features thatneed to be modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of theDNNs we tested. © 2016 IEEE.","","Accidents; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Crashworthiness; Distillation; Learning systems; Autonomous Vehicles; Content filter; Deep neural networks; Defense mechanism; Defensive mechanism; Machine learning problem; Machine learning techniques; Robustness properties; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Krizhevsky A., Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105, (2012); Sainath T.N., Mohamed A.-R., Kingsbury B., Ramabhadran B., Deep convolutional neural networks for lvcsr, Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2013 IEEE International Conference On.

Previous work on link prediction has focused on shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models - which potentially limits performance. In this work we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with 8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree - which are common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being present in the test set - however, the extent of this issue has so far not been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly used datasets - deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously proposed models, and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal Rank across all datasets.

Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassi fied by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder. © 2017 ACM.","","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education; Learning systems; Network security; Attack strategies; Controlling vehicles; Defense strategy; Human observers; Logistic regressions; Model outputs; Potential attack; Training data; Malware","","","","","Army Research Offce, (W911NF-13-1-0421); Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-13-2-0045); Google","Nicolas Papernot is supported by a Google PhD Fellowship in Security.

Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.

We provide an observation-based estimate of this flux at 123 ± 8 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year-1) using eddy covariance flux data and various diagnostic models. Tropical forests and savannahs account for 60%. GPP over 40% of the vegetated land is associated with precipitation. State-of-the-art process-oriented biosphere models used for climate predictions exhibit a large between-model variation of GPP's latitudinal patterns and show higher spatial correlations between GPP and precipitation, suggesting the existence of missing processes or feedback mechanisms which attenuate the vegetation response to climate. Our estimates of spatially distributed GPP and its covariation with climate can help improve coupled climate-carbon cycle process models.","","Artificial Intelligence; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climatic Processes; Ecosystem; Geography; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks (Computer); Oxygen Consumption; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants; Temperature; Trees; Uncertainty; Water; Georgia; Savannah; United States; carbon dioxide; biological uptake; biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; ecosystem function; eddy covariance; feedback mechanism; numerical model; physiological response; precipitation (climatology); primary production; terrestrial environment; tropical forest; vegetation cover; air temperature; article; biosphere; carbon cycle; climate; covariance; cropland; desert; ecosystem; feedback system; latitude; precipitation; priority journal; savanna; scrub; taiga; temperate deciduous forest; temperate grassland; tropical rain forest; tundra; vegetation","","carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Water, 7732-18-5","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (226701)","","Schulze E.-D., Flora, 159, (1970); Poorter H., Remkes C., Lambers H., Plant Physiol., 94, (1990); DeLucia E.H., Drake J.E., Thomas R.B., Gonzalez-Meler M., Glob.

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.","Competing conventions;

In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings. Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space. In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling. In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces. Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities. In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction. Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH.

It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the. plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated AEM as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard -based frameworks for fault diagnosis. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Diagnosis;

The main inspiration of the DA algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature. Two essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically. The paper also considers the proposal of binary and multi-objective versions of DA called binary DA (BDA) and multi-objective DA (MODA), respectively. The proposed algorithms are benchmarked by several mathematical test functions and one real case study qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of DA and BDA prove that the proposed algorithms are able to improve the initial random population for a given problem, converge towards the global optimum, and provide very competitive results compared to other well-known algorithms in the literature. The results of MODA also show that this algorithm tends to find very accurate approximations of Pareto optimal solutions with high uniform distribution for multi-objective problems. The set of designs obtained for the submarine propeller design problem demonstrate the merits of MODA in solving challenging real problems with unknown true Pareto optimal front as well.

However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs - extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.","","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Inference engines; Learning systems; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Uncertainty analysis; Applied machine learning; Approximate Bayesian inference; Computational costs; Deep neural networks; Extracting information; Model uncertainties; State-of-the-art methods; Theoretical framework; Bayesian networks","","","","","","","Anjos O., Iglesias C., Peres F., Martinez J., Garcia A., Taboada J., Neural networks applied to discriminate botanical origin of honeys, Food Chemistry, 175, pp. 128-136, (2015); Baldi P., Sadowski P., Whiteson D., Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning, Nature Communications, (2014); Barber D., Bishop C.M., Ensemble learning in Bayesian neural networks, Nato ASI Series F Computer and Systems Sciences, 168, pp. 215-238, (1998); Bergmann S., Stelzer S., Strassburger S., On the use of artificial neural networks in simulation-based manufacturing control, Journal of Simulation, 8, 1, pp. 76-90, (2014); Bergstra J., Breuleux O., Bastien F., Lamblin P., Pascanu R., Desjardins G., Turian J., Warde-Farley D., Bengio Y., Theano: A CPU and GPU math expression compiler, Proceedings of the Python for Scientific Computing Conference (SciPy), (2010); Blei D.M., Jordan M.I., Paisley J.W., Variational Bayesian inference with stochastic search, ICML, (2012); Blundell C., Cornebise J., Kavukcuoglu K., Wierstra D., Weight uncertainty in neural networks, ICML, (2015); Chen W., Wilson J.T., Tyree S., Weinberger K.Q., Chen Y., Compressing neural networks with the hashing trick, ICML-15, (2015); Chollet F., Keras, (2015); Damianou A., Lawrence N., Deep Gaussian processes, InAISTATS, (2013); Ghahramani Z., Probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence, Nature, 521, 7553, (2015); Graves A., Practical variational inference for neural networks, NIPS, (2011); Hernandez-Lobato J.M., Adams R.P., Probabilistic backpropagation for scalable learning of Bayesian neural networks, ICML-15, (2015); Herzog S., Ostwald D., Experimental biology: Sometimes Bayesian statistics are better, Nature, (2013); Hinton G.E., Van Camp D., Keeping the neural networks simple by minimizing the description length of the weights, Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, (1993); Hoffman M.D., Blei D.M., Wang C., Paisley J., Stochastic variational inference, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 14, 1, pp. 1303-1347, (2013); Jia Y., Shelhamer E., Donahue J., Karayev S., Long J., Girshick R., Guadarrama S., Darrell T., Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding, (2014); Karpathy A., Et al., A Javascript Implementation of Neural Networks, (2014); Keeling C.D., Whorf T.P., Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations (ppmv) Derived from in Situ Air Samples Collected at Mauna Loa Observatory, (2004); Kingma D.P., Welling M., Auto-encoding Variational Bayes, (2013); Kingma D., Ba J., Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization, (2014); Krzywinski M., Altman N., Points of significance: Importance of being uncertain, Nature Methods, 10, 9, (2013); Lean J., Solar Irradiance Reconstruction, (2004); LeCun Y., Cortes C., The Mnist Database of Handwritten Digits, (1998); LeCun Y., Bottou L., Bengio Y., Haffner P., Gradientbased learning applied to document recognition, Proceedings of the IEEE, 86, 11, pp. 2278-2324, (1998); Linda O., Vollmer T., Manic M., Neural network based intrusion detection system for critical infrastructures, Neural Networks, 2009.

We characterize precisely but intuitively when a cost matrix is reasonable, and we show how to avoid the mistake of defining a cost matrix that is economically incoherent. For the two-class case, we prove a theorem that shows how to change the proportion of negative examples in a training set in order to make optimal cost-sensitive classification decisions using a classifier learned by a standard non-cost-sensitive learning method. However, we then argue that changing the balance of negative and positive training examples has little effect on the classifiers produced by standard Bayesian and decision tree learning methods. Accordingly, the recommended way of applying one of these methods in a domain with differing misclassification costs is to learn a classifier from the training set as given, and then to compute optimal decisions explicitly using the probability estimates given by the classifier.","","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Costs; Decision making; Decision trees; Learning systems; Optimization; Cost-sensitive classification; Cost-sensitive learning; Decision tree learning; Misclassification costs; Misclassification error; Negative examples; Optimal decisions; Probability estimate; Cost benefit analysis","","","","","","","Bauer E., Kohavi R., An empirical comparison of voting classification algorithms: Bagging, boosting, and variants, Machine Learning, 36, pp. 105-139, (1999); Bradford J., Kunz C., Kohavi R., Brunk C., Brodley C., Pruning decision trees with misclassification costs, Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 131-136, (1998); Breiman L., Friedman J.H., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Dietterich T.G., Kearns M., Mansour Y., Applying the weak learning framework to understand and improve C4.5, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 96-104, (1996); Domingos P., Pazzani M., Beyond independence: Conditions for the optimality of the simple Bayesian classifier, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 105-112, (1996); Drummond C., Holte R.C., Exploiting the cost (in)sensitivity of decision tree splitting criteria, Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 239-246, (2000); Japkowicz N., The class imbalance problem: Significance and strategies, Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Las Vegas, June 2000; Kearns M., Mansour Y., On the boosting ability of top-down decision tree learning algorithms, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, pp. 459-468, (1996); Kubat M., Matwin S., Addressing the curse of imbalanced training sets: One-sided sampling, Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 179-186, (1997); Margineantu D., On class probability estimates and cost-sensitive evaluation of classifiers, Workshop Notes, Workshop on Cost-Sensitive Learning, International Conference on Machine Learning, June 2000; Michie D., Spiegelhalter D.J., Taylor C.C., Machine Learning, Neural and Statistical Classification, (1994); Provost F., Domingos P., Well-trained PETs: Improving Probability Estimation Trees, (2000); Weiss G.M., Provost F., The Effect of Class Distribution on Classifier Learning, (2001); Zadrozny B., Elkan C., Learning and Making Decisions When Costs and Probabilities Are Both Unknown, (2001); Zadrozny B., Elkan C., Obtaining calibrated probability estimates from decision trees and naive Bayesian classifiers, Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, 2001","C.

Our generic tasks may differ significantly from the originally trained tasks and there may be insufficient labeled or unlabeled data to conventionally train or adapt a deep architecture to the new tasks. We investigate and visualize the semantic clustering of deep convolutional features with respect to a variety of such tasks, including scene recognition, domain adaptation, and fine-grained recognition challenges. We compare the efficacy of relying on various network levels to define a fixed feature, and report novel results that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several important vision challenges. We are releasing DeCAF, an open-source implementation of these deep convolutional activation features, along with all associated network parameters to enable vision researchers to be able to conduct experimenta-tion with deep representations across a range of visual concept learning paradigms.

As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1–3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Learning; Reinforcement, Psychology; Video Games; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; complexity; detection method; machine learning; algorithm; article; deep neural network; human; human experiment; race; reinforcement learning (machine learning); skill; artificial intelligence; learning; video game","","","","","","","Student Starcraft AI Tournament and Ladder; Churchill D., Lin Z., Synnaeve G., An analysis of model-based heuristic search techniques for StarCraft combat scenarios, Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conf.

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: They lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ""powerful,"" ""strong"" and ""Paris"" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of- words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.

Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 ± 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni±o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Clear, well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method, which is comparable or better than other automated methods. An implementation of this method, called FIRST, is currently distributed with the freely-available FSL package. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian; Classification; Segmentation; Shape model; Subcortical structures","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results; Thalamus; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; analysis of covariance; article; autoanalysis; Bayes theorem; brain cortex; conceptual framework; controlled study; data analysis software; display system; human; image analysis; image processing; image quality; image segmentation; imaging and display; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; mathematical computing; mathematical model; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quantitative analysis; structure analysis; tissue distribution; voxel based morphometry","","","","","Barry Kosofsky; Department of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School; VU University Medical Center; Weill Cornell Medical Center, (R01 DA017905); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K01 MH01798, K08 MH01573, R01 NS052585-01, R01 RR16594-01A1); National Center for Research Resources, NCRR, (P41RR014075); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC","The authors wish to thank Dr Mojtaba Zarei for very helpful discussions about Alzheimer's Disease, as well as the UK EPSRC IBIM Grant and the UK BBSRC David Phillips Fellowship for funding this research.

We show that this problem persists in an actor-critic setting and propose novel mechanisms to minimize its effects on both the actor and the critic. Our algorithm builds on Double Q-learning, by taking the minimum value between a pair of critics to limit over- estimation. We draw the conncction between target networks and overestimation bias, and suggest delaying policy updates to reduce per-update error and further improve performance. We evaluate our method on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks, outperforming the state of the art in every environment tested. © 2018 35th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2018.

In order to overcome the difficulties caused by intensity inhomogeneities, we propose a region-based active contour model that draws upon intensity information in local regions at a controllable scale. A data fitting energy is defined in terms of a contour and two fitting functions that locally approximate the image intensities on the two sides of the contour. This energy is then incorporated into a variational level set formulation with a level set regularization term, from which a curve evolution equation is derived for energy minimization. Due to a kernel function in the data fitting term, intensity information in local regions is extracted to guide the motion of the contour, which thereby enables our model to cope with intensity inhomogeneity. In addition, the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically preserved by the level set regularization term to ensure accurate computation and avoids expensive reinitialization of the evolving level set function. Experimental results for synthetic and real images show desirable performances of our method. © 2008 IEEE.","Image segmentation; Intensity inhomogeneity; Level set method; Region-scalable fitting energy; Variational method","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Differential equations; Digital image storage; Equations of motion; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Level measurement; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Active contour model; Curve evolution; Data fittings; Energy minimizations; Fitting functions; Image intensities; Inhomogeneities; Intensity information; Intensity inhomogeneity; Kernel functions; Level Set functions; Level set method; Level Sets; Local regions; Re-initialization; Real images; Real-world images; Region-based; Region-scalable fitting energy; Variational level set; Variational method; Set theory","","","","","National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB, (R01EB000461)","","An J., Rousson M., Xu C., Γ-convergence approximation to piecewise smooth medical image segmentation, Proc.

In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al. [13], adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.","","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Surveys; Trees (mathematics); Confidence information; Facial recognition; Genomic information; Lifestyle choices; Linear classifiers; Personalized medicines; Sensitive application; Training algorithms; Face recognition","","","","","","","Deepface: Closing the gap to human-level performance in face verification, Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR); AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.

As an emerging field in industrial applications and an effective solution for fault recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry. However, great challenges are met by the AI methods under the different real operating conditions. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of AI algorithms in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, from both the views of theory background and industrial applications. A brief introduction of different AI algorithms is presented first, including the following methods: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support vector machine, artificial neural network and deep learning. Then, a broad literature survey of these AI algorithms in industrial applications is given. Finally, the advantages, limitations, practical implications of different AI algorithms, as well as some new research trends, are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; k-Nearest neighbour; Naive Bayes; Rotating machinery; Support vector machine","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Machinery; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Rotating machinery; Support vector machines; Effective solution; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Industrial systems; K-nearest neighbours; Machinery fault diagnosis; Naive bayes; Real operating conditions; Reliability and safeties; Fault detection","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51335006); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2015CB057400)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51335006 ) and National Key Basic Research Program of China (No. 2015CB057400 ).

For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms. © 1990.","","Computer Programming--Algorithms; Probability; Bayesian Belief Networks; Computational Complexity; Probabilistic Inference; Artificial Intelligence","","","","","U.S. Army Research Office, (LM-07033); National Science Foundation, NSF, (P-25514-EL); National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM, (RR-00785)","I thank Marty Chavez, Lyn Dupre, David Heckerman, Eddie Herskovits, Eric Horvitz, Richard Lin, Judea Pearl, and Mike Wellman for valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them.

With the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored in digital image form. Consequently, digitized tissue histopathology has now become amenable to the application of computerized image analysis and machine learning techniques. Analogous to the role of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) algorithms in medical imaging to complement the opinion of a radiologist, CAD algorithms have begun to be developed for disease detection, diagnosis, and prognosis prediction to complement the opinion of the pathologist. In this paper, we review the recent state of the art CAD technology for digitized histopathology. This paper also briefly describes the development and application of novel image analysis technology for a few specific histopathology related problems being pursued in the United States and Europe. © 2009, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.","Computer-aided diagnosis; computer-assisted interpretation; digital pathology; histopathology; image analysis; microscopy analysis","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Europe; Histocytochemistry; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Prognosis; United States; algorithm; artificial intelligence; computer assisted diagnosis; cytochemistry; Europe; human; methodology; prognosis; review; United States","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA134451); National Cancer Institute, NCI","","Mendez A.J., Tahoces P.G., Lado M.J., Souto M., Vidal J.J., Computer-aided diagnosis: Automatic detection of malignant masses in digitized mammograms, Med Phys., 25, pp. 957-964, (1998); Tang J., Rangayyan R., Xu J., Naqa I.E., Yang Y., Computer-aided detection and diagnosis of breast cancer with mammography: Recent advances, IEEE Trans.

While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classification algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classification problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach.","","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information);

This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Phospholipids; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase C; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Cell culture; Computational methods; Immunology; Learning systems; Phospholipids; Physiological models; Signaling; Tissue; phospholipid; protein; biochemistry; biology; accuracy; article; automation; Bayes theorem; derivatization; immunocompetent cell; mathematical computing; prediction; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; Cellular signaling networks; Complex drug actions; Human immune system cells; Network models; Proteins","","protein, 67254-75-5; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, ; Phospholipids, ; Phosphoproteins, ; Protein Kinase C, EC 2.7.1.37; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, EC 2.7.1.37; Proto-Oncogene Proteins, ; RNA, Small Interfering, ","","","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, (P01AI039646)","","Ideker T., Galitski T., Hood L., Annu.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.

I-Mutant2.0 predictions are performed starting either from the protein structure or, more importantly, from the protein sequence. This latter task, to the best of our knowledge, is exploited for the first time. The method was trained and tested on a data set derived from ProTherm, which is presently the most comprehensive available database of thermodynamic experimental data of free energy changes of protein stability upon mutation under different conditions. I-Mutant2.0 can be used both as a classifier for predicting the sign of the protein stability change upon mutation and as a regression estimator for predicting the related ΔΔG values. Acting as a classifier, I-Mutant2.0 correctly predicts (with a cross-validation procedure) 80% or 77% of the data set, depending on the usage of structural or sequence information, respectively. When predicting ΔΔG values associated with mutations, the correlation of predicted with expected/ experimental values is 0.71 (with a standard error of 1.30 kcal/mol) and 0.62 (with a standard error of 1.45 kcal/mol) when structural or sequence information are respectively adopted. Our web interface allows the selection of a predictive mode that depends on the availability of the protein structure and/or sequence. In this latter case, the web server requires only pasting of a protein sequence in a raw format. We therefore introduce I-Mutant2.0 as a unique and valuable helper for protein design, even when the protein structure is not yet known with atomic resolution.

This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches (Daumé III et al., 2009; Ross and Bagnell, 2010) provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.

We review and analyze past approaches to feature selection and note their strengths and weaknesses. We then introduces and theoretically examine a new algorithm Relief which selects relevant features using a statistical method. Relief does not depend on heuristics, is accurate even if features interact, and is noise-tolerant. It requires only linear time in the number of given features and the number of training instances, regardless of the target concept complexity. The algorithm also has certain limitations such as non-optimal feature set size. Ways to overcome the limitations are suggested. We also report the test results of comparison between Relief and other feature selection algorithms. The empirical results support the theoretical analysis, suggesting a practical approach to feature selection for real-world problems.","","Algorithms; Computer science; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Statistical methods; Concept learning; Feature selection; Relief algorithm; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","","","","Publ by AAAI","American Assoc for Artificial Intelligence","Proceedings Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence - AAAI-92","12 July 1992 through 16 July 1992","San Jose, CA, USA","17964","","0262510634","","","English","Proc Tenth Natl Conf Artif Intell AAAI 92","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027002164"

Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point of view. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Data science; Data-driven decision-making; Deep learning; Intelligent applications; Machine learning; Predictive analytics","","","","","","","","] Google Trends.; Adnan N., Nordin Shahrina M., Rahman I., Noor A., .

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","analytical intelligence;

The survey discusses distance functions, smoothing parameters, weighting functions, local model structures, regularization of the estimates and bias, assessing predictions, handling noisy data and outliers, improving the quality of predictions by tuning fit parameters, interference between old and new data, implementing locally weighted learning efficiently, and applications of locally weighted learning. A companion paper surveys how locally weighted learning can be used in robot learning and control.","Distance functions; Global tuning; Interference; Lazy learning; Least commitment learning; Local tuning; Locally weighted regression; LOESS; LWR; Memory-based learning; Smoothing parameters; Weighting functions","Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Data storage equipment; Functions; Regression analysis; Distance functions; Lazy learning; Locally weighted learning; Locally weighted linear regression; Memory based learning; Weighting functions; Learning systems","","","","","","","Ninth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (1991); Aha D.W., Incremental, instance-based learning of independent and graded concept descriptions, Sixth International Machine Learning Workshop, pp. 387-391, (1989); Aha D.W., A Study of Instance-Based Algorithms for Supervised Learning Tasks: Mathematical, Empirical, and Psychological Observations, (1990); Aha D.W., Incremental constructive induction: An instance-based approach, Eighth International Machine Learning Workshop, pp. 117-121, (1991); Aha D.W., Goldstone R.L., Learning attribute relevance in context in instance-based learning algorithms, 12th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 141-148, (1990); Aha D.W., Goldstone R.L., Concept learning and flexible weighting, 14th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 534-539, (1992); Aha D.W., Kibler D., Noise-tolerant instance-based learning algorithms, Eleventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 794-799, (1989); Aha D.W., McNulty D.M., Learning relative attribute weights for instance-based concept descriptions, 11th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, pp. 530-537, (1989); Aha D.W., Salzberg S.L., Learning to catch: Applying nearest neighbor algorithms to dynamic control tasks, Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 363-368, (1993); Altman N.S., An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression, The American Statistician, 46, 3, pp. 175-185, (1992); Atkeson C.G., Using local models to control movement, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2, pp. 316-323, (1990); Atkeson C.G., Memory-based approaches to approximating continuous functions, Proceedings of a Workshop on Nonlinear Modeling and Forecasting September 17-21, 1990, pp. 503-521, (1992); Atkeson C.G., Local Learning, (1996); Atkeson C.G., Moore A.W., Schaal S., Locally weighted learning for control, Artificial Intelligence Review, (1997); Atkeson C.G., Reinkensmeyer D.J., Using associative content-addressable memories to control robots, Proceedings of the 27th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 1, pp. 792-797, (1988); Atkeson C.G., Reinkensmeyer D.J., Using associative content-addressable memories to control robots, Proceedings, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, (1989); Atkeson C.G., Schaal S., Memory-based neural networks for robot learning, Neurocomputing, 9, pp. 243-269, (1995); Baird L.C., Klopf A.H., Reinforcement Learning with High-dimensional, Continuous Actions, (1993); Barnhill R.E., Representation and approximation of surfaces, Mathematical Software III, pp. 69-120, (1977); Batchelor B.G., Practical Approach to Pattern Classification, (1974); Benedetti J.K., On the nonparametric estimation of regression functions, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 39, pp. 248-253, (1977); Bentley J.L., Multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching, Communications of the ACM, 18, 9, pp. 509-517, (1975); Bentley J.L., Friedman J.H., Data structures for range searching, ACM Comput.

The well known examples for these swarms are bird flocks, fish schools and the colony of social insects such as termites, ants and bees. In 1990s, especially two approaches based on ant colony and on fish schooling/bird flocking introduced have highly attracted the interest of researchers. Although the self-organization features are required by SI are strongly and clearly seen in honey bee colonies, unfortunately the researchers have recently started to be interested in the behaviour of these swarm systems to describe new intelligent approaches, especially from the beginning of 2000s. During a decade, several algorithms have been developed depending on different intelligent behaviours of honey bee swarms. Among those, artificial bee colony (ABC) is the one which has been most widely studied on and applied to solve the real world problems, so far. Day by day the number of researchers being interested in ABC algorithm increases rapidly. This work presents a comprehensive survey of the advances with ABC and its applications. It is hoped that this survey would be very beneficial for the researchers studying on SI, particularly ABC algorithm. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial bee colony algorithm; Bee swarm intelligence;

These algorithms typically involve a large number of multiply-accumulate (dot-product) operations. A recent project, DaDianNao, adopts a near data processing approach, where a specialized neural functional unit performs all the digital arithmetic operations and receives input weights from adjacent eDRAM banks. This work explores an in-situ processing approach, where memristor crossbar arrays not only store input weights, but are also used to perform dot-product operations in an analog manner. While the use of crossbar memory as an analog dot-product engine is well known, no prior work has designed or characterized a full-fledged accelerator based on crossbars. In particular, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We design a pipelined architecture, with some crossbars dedicated for each neural network layer, and eDRAM buffers that aggregate data between pipeline stages. (ii) We define new data encoding techniques that are amenable to analog computations and that can reduce the high overheads of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). (iii) We define the many supporting digital components required in an analog CNN accelerator and carry out a design space exploration to identify the best balance of memristor storage/compute, ADCs, and eDRAM storage on a chip. On a suite of CNN and DNN workloads, the proposed ISAAC architecture yields improvements of 14.8, 5.5, and 7.5 in throughput, energy, and computational density (respectively), relative to the state-of-the-art DaDianNao architecture. © 2016 IEEE.","accelerator;

The algorithm is computationally appealing, given the availability of platforms optimized for DCT computation. The approach relies on a simple Bayesian inference model to predict image quality scores given certain extracted features. The features are based on an NSS model of the image DCT coefficients. The estimated parameters of the model are utilized to form features that are indicative of perceptual quality. These features are used in a simple Bayesian inference approach to predict quality scores. The resulting algorithm, which we name BLIINDS-II, requires minimal training and adopts a simple probabilistic model for score prediction. Given the extracted features from a test image, the quality score that maximizes the probability of the empirically determined inference model is chosen as the predicted quality score of that image. When tested on the LIVE IQA database, BLIINDS-II is shown to correlate highly with human judgments of quality, at a level that is competitive with the popular SSIM index. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Discrete cosine transform (DCT); generalized Gaussian density; natural scene statistics; no-reference image quality assessment","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Single-Blind Method; Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Discrete cosine transforms; Forecasting; Inference engines; Quality control; Bayesian inference; Bayesian inference model; DCT coefficients; DCT domain; Discrete cosine transform coefficients; Estimated parameter; Form features; Generalized Gaussian density; Human judgments; Image quality assessment; Inference models; Minimal training; Natural scene statistics; No-reference image quality assessments; Perceptual quality; Probabilistic models; Test images; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; single blind procedure; statistical analysis; three dimensional imaging; article; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; methodology; three dimensional imaging; Image quality","","","","","Cisco, Inc.; Intel Corporation","Manuscript received December 14, 2010; revised April 12, 2011; accepted March 5, 2012.

We regard human actions as three- imensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the spacetime volume. We adopt a recent approach [14] for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract spacetime features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action, and low quality video. © 2007 IEEE.","Action recognition; Action representation; Poisson equation; Shape analysis; Space-time analysis","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Biological; Movement; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Whole Body Imaging; Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Image recognition; Poisson equation; Space time adaptive processing; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; human; image enhancement; methodology; movement (physiology); physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; whole body imaging; Action recognition; Action representation; Shape analysis; Space-time analysis; Motion compensation","","","","","European Commission, EC, (IST-2002-506766); United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation, BSF, (2002/254); Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (267/02)","The authors thank Lihi Zelnik-Manor for helpful discussions and her assistance in adjusting the method in [33] for comparison.

WSD is considered an AI-complete problem, that is, a task whose solution is at least as hard as the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence. We introduce the reader to the motivations for solving the ambiguity of words and provide a description of the task. We overview supervised, unsupervised, and knowledge-based approaches. The assessment of WSD systems is discussed in the context of the Senseval/Semeval campaigns, aiming at the objective evaluation of systems participating in several different disambiguation tasks.

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.

We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast the inflow and outflow of crowds in each and every region of a city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. Experiments on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC) demonstrate that the proposed ST-ResNet outperforms six well-known methods.

To help fill this critical void, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which naturally expresses asynchronous, dynamic, graph-parallel computation while ensuring data consistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance in the shared-memory setting. In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to the substantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong data consistency guarantees. We develop graph based extensions to pipelined locking and data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect of network latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstraction using the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it can be easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself. Finally, we evaluate our distributed implementation of the GraphLab abstraction on a large Amazon EC2 deployment and show 1-2 orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop-based implementations. © 2012 VLDB Endowment.","","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Fault tolerance; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Locks (fasteners); Parallel processing systems; Design and implementations; Distributed implementation; Large-scale data processing; Network congestions; Orders of magnitude; Parallel Computation; Parallel performance; Snapshot algorithms; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Angles R., Gutierrez C., Survey of graph database models, ACM Comput.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies. By applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems are evolving into real time artificial intelligence enabled programs that provide rich recommendations and insights for farmer decision support and action. © 2018 by the authors.

It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.

This has also prompted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data driven models based on machine learning in health informatics. Deep learning, a technique with its foundation in artificial neural networks, is emerging in recent years as a powerful tool for machine learning, promising to reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Rapid improvements in computational power, fast data storage, and parallelization have also contributed to the rapid uptake of the technology in addition to its predictive power and ability to generate automatically optimized high-level features and semantic interpretation from the input data. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of research employing deep learning in health informatics, providing a critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future outlook. The paper mainly focuses on key applications of deep learning in the fields of translational bioinformatics, medical imaging, pervasive sensing, medical informatics, and public health. © 2013 IEEE.","Bioinformatics; deep learning; health informatics; machine learning; medical imaging; public health; wearable devices","Computational Biology; Humans; Machine Learning; Medical Informatics; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Public Health; Bioinformatics; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Medical informatics; Public health; Semantics; Computational power; Critical analysis; Data-driven model; High-level features; Parallelizations; Pervasive sensing; Semantic interpretation; Wearable devices; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; bioinformatics; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; medical informatics; ambulatory monitoring; biology; human; medical informatics; procedures; public health; Deep learning","","","","","EPSRC-NIHR HTC; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/E044298/1, EP/H009744/1, EP/J021199/1, EP/L014149/1, EP/M000257/1, EP/N02334X/1, EP/N027132/1)","This work was supported by the EPSRC Smart Sensing for Surgery (EP/L014149/1) and in part by the EPSRC-NIHR HTC Partnership Award (EP/M000257/1 and EP/N027132/1)","Roth H.R., Et al., Improving computer-aided detection using convolutional neural networks and random view aggregation, IEEE Trans.

This thesis is interesting in that it disagrees with a large body of recent published work on multiclass classification.

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Business modelling; Data; Data infrastructure; Governance; Information and communication technology","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data acquisition; data set; decision making; food production; food supply; governance approach; literature review; power relations; stakeholder; supply chain management","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (731884); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","","AgGateway, Data privacy and use white paper, (2014); Al-Debei M.M., Avison D., Developing a unified framework of the business model concept, Eur.

The algorithm trains a regression model on sequence and contextual features extracted from miRanda-predicted target sites. In a large-scale evaluation, miRanda-mirSVR is competitive with other target prediction methods in identifying target genes and predicting the extent of their downregulation at the mRNA or protein levels. Importantly, the method identifies a significant number of experimentally determined non-canonical and non-conserved sites. © 2010 Betel et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Binding Sites; Down-Regulation; MicroRNAs; Models, Molecular; Proteins; Regression Analysis; RNA, Messenger; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA; protein; 3' untranslated region; accuracy; algorithm; article; computer prediction; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene identification; intermethod comparison; protein expression; support vector machine; artificial intelligence; binding site; chemical structure; evaluation; genetics; regression analysis","","protein, 67254-75-5; MicroRNAs, ; Proteins, ; RNA, Messenger, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (1U24CA143840); National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (P01GM073047)","We thank Debora Marks for helpful discussions; Aly Khan for technical assistance; Rob Sheridan, Manda Wilson and Aaron Gabow for adaptation of mirSVR scores to miRanda sites at the http://www.microRNA.org target prediction resource; and Markus Hafner and Tom Tuschl for providing the PAR-CLIP data.

However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search.

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ""visual words"" selected from a discrete vocabulary. This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index. ©2008 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Database systems; Image processing; Pattern recognition; Standards; Current state; Data sets; Descriptor; Descriptors; High-dimensional; Large databases; Large scale image; Local regions; Object retrieval; Query expansion; Retrieval performance; State of the arts; Storage requirements; Text retrieval; Visual objects; Weighted sets; Feature extraction","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (215078)","","Aasheim Y., Lidal M., Risvik K., Multi-tier architecture for web search engines, Web Congress, 2003.

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias. © 2016 NIPS Foundation - All Rights Reserved.","","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Computer programmers; Gender bias; Gender neutrals; Gender stereotypes; Linearly separable; NAtural language processing; News articles; Useful properties; Social sciences","","","","","","","Angwin J., Larson J., Mattu S., Kirchner L., Machine Bias: There's Software Used Across the Country to Predict Future Criminals. and It's Biased Against Blacks, (2016); Barocas S., Selbst A.D., Big Data's Disparate Impact, (2014); Beigman E., Klebanov B.B., Learning with annotation noise, ACL, (2009); Datta A., Tschantz M.C., Datta A., Automated experiments on ad privacy settings, Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies, (2015); Dwork C., Hardt M., Pitassi T., Reingold O., Zemel R., Fairness through awareness, Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference, (2012); Eisenstein J., O'Connor B., Smith N.A., Xing E.P., Diffusion of lexical change in social media, PLoS ONE, pp. 1-13, (2014); Faruqui M., Dodge J., Jauhar S.K., Dyer C., Hovy E., Smith N.A., Retrofitting word vectors to semantic lexicons, NAACL, (2015); Feldman M., Friedler S.A., Moeller J., Scheidegger C., Venkatasubramanian S., Certifying and removing disparate impact, KDD, (2015); Fellbaum C., Wordnet: An Electronic Lexical Database, (1998); Finkelstein L., Gabrilovich E., Matias Y., Rivlin E., Solan Z., Wolfman G., Ruppin E., Placing search in context: The concept revisited, WWW.

The method allocates manually detected heartbeats to one of the five beat classes recommended by ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998 standard, i.e., normal beat, ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB), fusion of a normal and a VEB, or unknown beat type. Data was obtained from the 44 nonpacemaker recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The data was split into two datasets with each dataset containing approximately 50 000 beats from 22 recordings. The first dataset was used to select a classifier configuration from candidate configurations. Twelve configurations processing feature sets derived from two ECG leads were compared. Feature sets were based on ECG morphology, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals. All configurations adopted a statistical classifier model utilizing supervised learning. The second dataset was used to provide an independent performance assessment of the selected configuration. This assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 75.9%, a positive predictivity of 38.5%, and a false positive rate of 4.7% for the SVEB class. For the VEB class, the sensitivity was 77.7%, the positive predictivity was 81.9%, and the false positive rate was 1.2%. These results are an improvement on previously reported results for automated heartbeat classification systems.","Electrocardiogram (ECG); Heartbeat classifier; Linear discriminant analysis; Statistical classifier model","Algorithms; Arrhythmia; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; European Union; False Positive Reactions; Heart Rate; Humans; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; United States; Cardiology; Electrocardiography; Mathematical models; Morphology; article; automation; electrocardiogram; heart arrhythmia; heart beat; heart ventricle extrasystole; morphology; RR interval; sensitivity and specificity; technique; Datasets; Heartbeat intervals; Heartbeats; Ventricular ectopic beats (VEB); Biomedical engineering","","","","","Informatics Research Initiative of Enterprise Ireland","Manuscript received April 25, 2003; revised August 26, 2003.

Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes K NOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.","","Artificial intelligence; Error reduction; Extraction rule; Manual labors; On the flies; Orders of magnitude; Training example; User query; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Agichtein E., Gravano L., Snowball: Extracting relations from large plain-text collections, Proceedings of the Fifth ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries, 2000; Brill E., Ngai G., Man (and woman) vs. machine: A case study in base noun phrase learning, Proceedings of the ACL, pp. 65-72, (1999); Brin S., Extracting Patterns and Relations from the World Wide Web, WebDB Workshop at 6th International Conference on Extending Database Technology, EDBT'98, pp. 172-183, (1998); Bunescu R., Mooney R., A shortest path dependency kernel for relation extraction, Proc. of the HLT/EMLNP, 2005; Cafarella M.J., Banko M., Etzioni O., Relational Web Search, (2006); Ciaramita M., Gangemi A., Ratsch E., Saric J., Rojas I., Unsupervised learning of semantic relations between concepts of a molecular biology ontology, Proceedings of IJCAI, 2005; Craven M., DiPasquo D., Freitag D., McCallum A., Mitchell T., Nigam K., Slattery S., Learning to construct knowledge bases from the world wide web, Artificial Intelligence, (1999); Culotta A., McCallum A., Betz J., Integrating probabilistic extraction models and relational data mining to discover relations and patterns in text, Proceedings of HLT-NAACL, New York, NY, 2006; Downey D., Etzioni O., Soderland S., A Probabilistic Model of Redundancy in Information Extraction, Proc. of IJCAI, 2005; Downey D., Broadhead M., Etzioni O., Locating Complex Named Entities in Web Text, Proc. of IJCAI, 2007; Etzioni O., Cafarella M., Downey D., Popescu A.-M., Shaked T., Soderland S., Weld D.S., Yates A., Unsupervised named-entity extraction from the Web: An experimental study, Artificial Intelligence, 165, 1, pp. 91-134, (2005); Kambhatla N., Combining lexical, syntactic and semantic features with maximum entropy models, Proceedings of ACL, 2004; Klein D., Manning C.D., Accurate unlexicalized parsing, Proceedings of the ACL, 2003; Lin D., Pantel P., Discovery of inference rules from text, Proceedings of KDD, 2001; Ngai G., Florian R., Transformation-based learning in the fast lane, Proceedings of the NAACL, pp. 40-47, (2001); Pasca M., Lin D., Bigham J., Lifchits A., Jain A., Names and similarities on the web: Fact extraction in the fast lane, Proc. of ACL/COLING 2006, 2006; Ratnaparkhi A., Maximum Entropy Models for Natural Language Ambiguity Resolution, (1998); Ravichandran D., Hovy D., Learning surface text patterns for a question answering system, Proceedings of the ACL, pp. 41-47, (2002); Riloff E., Automatically constructing extraction patterns from untagged text, Proc. of AAAI, 1996; Rosario B., Hearst M., Classifying semantic relations in bioscience text, Proc. of ACL, 2004; Sekine S., On-demand information extraction, Procs. of COLING, 2006; Shinyama Y., Sekine S., Preemptive information extraction using unrestricted relation discovery, Proc. of the HLT-NAACL, 2006","","","","IJCAI; Trust to Promote Advanced Technology in India (TRAPI); Computer Society of India (CSI); IIITH; Infosys","20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI 2007","6 January 2007 through 12 January 2007","Hyderabad","97873","10450823","","","","English","IJCAI Int.

We approach this problem from the perspective of compressed sensing. The low-resolution image is viewed as downsampled version of a high-resolution image, whose patches are assumed to have a sparse representation with respect to an over-complete dictionary of prototype signal-atoms. The principle of compressed sensing ensures that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signal. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of sparsity as a prior for regularizing the otherwise ill-posed super-resolution problem. We further show that a small set of randomly chosen raw patches from training images of similar statistical nature to the input image generally serve as a good dictionary, in the sense that the computed representation is sparse and the recovered high-resolution image is competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other SR methods. ©2008 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Optical resolving power; Pattern recognition; Signal reconstruction; Statistical methods; Compressed sensing; High-resolution imaging; Ill-posed; Image super resolutions; Input images; Low-resolution; Mild conditions; Over-complete; Paper addresses; Raw images; Sparse representations; Super resolutions; Super-resolution; Training images; Laws and legislation","","","","","","","Aharon M., Elad M., Bruckstein A., K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 54, 11, (2006); Baker S., Kanade T., Limits on super-resolution and how to break them, IEEE TPAMI, 24, 9, pp. 1167-1183, (2002); Candes E., Compressive sensing, Proc.

But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell you about the world? Models should be not only good, but also interpretable, yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. The academic literature has provided diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability and has offered myriad techniques for rendering interpretable models. Despite this ambiguity, many authors proclaim their models to be interpretable axiomatically, absent further argument. Problematically, it is not clear what common properties unite these techniques. This article seeks to refine the discourse on interpretability. First it examines the objectives of previous papers addressing interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, it explores model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post hoc explanations as competing concepts. Throughout, the feasibility and desirability of different notions of interpretability are discussed. The article questions the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

This approach reduces learning to the problem of recovering a utility function that makes the behavior induced by a near-optimal policy closely mimic demonstrated behavior. In this work, we develop a probabilistic approach based on the principle of maximum entropy. Our approach provides a well-defined, globally normalized distribution over decision sequences, while providing the same performance guarantees as existing methods. We develop our technique in the context of modeling real-world navigation and driving behaviors where collected data is inherently noisy and imperfect. Our probabilistic approach enables modeling of route preferences as well as a powerful new approach to inferring destinations and routes based on partial trajectories.

Our goal is to create 3D models that are both quantitatively accurate as well as visually pleasing. For each small homogeneous patch in the image, we use a Markov Random Field (MRF) to infer a set of ""plane parameters"" that capture both the 3D location and 3D orientation of the patch. The MRF, trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the image. Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the algorithm to capture much more detailed 3D structure than does prior art and also give a much richer experience in the 3D flythroughs created using image-based rendering, even for scenes with significant nonvertical structure. Using this approach, we have created qualitatively correct 3D models for 64.9 percent of 588 images downloaded from the Internet. We have also extended our model to produce large-scale 3D models from a few images. © 2009 IEEE.","Depth cues; Learning depth; Machine learning; Monocular vision; Scene analysis; Vision and scene understanding","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Content based retrieval; Education; Hidden Markov models; Image reconstruction; Robot learning; Structural frames; Three dimensional computer graphics; Depth cues; Learning depth; Machine learning; Monocular vision; Scene analysis; Vision and scene understanding; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; photography; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Three dimensional","","","","","Pixblitz Studios; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-0551737); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (MURI N000140710747)","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation under Award CNS-0551737, by the US Office of Naval Research under MURI N000140710747, and by Pixblitz Studios.

Such principles provide specifications for artificial agents, and approximate a theory of human action (as philosophers use the term). By making explicit the conditions under which an agent can drop his goals, i.e., by specifying how the agent is committed to his goals, the formalism captures a number of important properties of intention. Specifically, the formalism provides analyses for Bratman's three characteristic functional roles played by intentions [7, 9], and shows how agents can avoid intending all the foreseen side-effects of what they actually intend. Finally, the analysis shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant beliefs and other intentions or goals. By relativizing one agent's intentions in terms of beliefs about another agent's intentions (or beliefs), we derive a preliminary account of interpersonal commitments. © 1990.","","Human Action; Interpersonal Commitments; Artificial Intelligence","","","","","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (N00039-84-K-0078); Naval Air Systems Command, NAVAIR; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","*This research was made possible by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation, by support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and by support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract N00039-84-K-0078 with the Naval Electronic Systems Command.

The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen [13]. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by Gabbay [10], while the latter has been advocated by Shoham [38]. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by Adams [2]. The preferential models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first-order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper. © 1990.","","Artificial Intelligence; Systems Science and Cybernetics--Cognitive Systems; Cumulative Logics; Nonmonotonic Reasoning; Preferential Models; Computer Metatheory","","","","","Jean and Helene Alfassa fund for research in Artificial Intelligence","*This work was partially supported by the Jean and Helene Alfassa fund for research in Artificial Intelligence. **This work was done while the author was at Hebrew University.","Adams, Probability and the logic of conditional, Aspects of Inductive Logic, (1966); Adams, The Logic of Conditionals, (1975); Avron, Simple consequence relations, LFCS Report Series 87-30, (1987); Burgess, Quick completeness proofs for some logics of conditionals, Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, 22, pp. 76-84, (1981); Clark, Negation as failure, Logics and Data Bases, pp. 293-322, (1978); Delgrande, A first-order logic for prototypical properties, Artificial Intelligence, 33, pp. 105-130, (1987); Delgrande, An approach to default reasoning based on a first-order conditional logic: Revised report, Artificial Intelligence, 36, pp. 63-90, (1988); Etherington, Mercer, Reiter, On the adequacy of predicate circumscription for closed-world reasoning, Computational Intelligence, 1, pp. 11-15, (1985); Freund, Lehmann, Faithful models and preferential inference operations, Manuscript, (1989); Gabbay, Theoretical foundations for non-monotonic reasoning in expert systems, Proceedings NATO Advanced Study Institute on Logics and Models of Concurrent Systems, pp. 439-457, (1985); Gentzen, Über die Existenz unabhängiger Axiomensysteme zu unendlichen Satzsystemen, Math.

However, throughout its entire history it has drawn both praise and criticism concerning its reliability, limitations, successes, and failures. In this paper, we discuss (i) the development and evolution of QSAR; (ii) the current trends, unsolved problems, and pressing challenges; and (iii) several novel and emerging applications of QSAR modeling. Throughout this discussion, we provide guidelines for QSAR development, validation, and application, which are summarized in best practices for building rigorously validated and externally predictive QSAR models. We hope that this Perspective will help communications between computational and experimental chemists toward collaborative development and use of QSAR models. We also believe that the guidelines presented here will help journal editors and reviewers apply more stringent scientific standards to manuscripts reporting new QSAR studies, as well as encourage the use of high quality, validated QSARs for regulatory decision making. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","","Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Artificial Intelligence; Complex Mixtures; Databases, Factual; Drug Design; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Models, Molecular; Nanostructures; Pharmacokinetics; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Quantum Theory; Toxicology; medicinal chemistry; model; practice guideline; quantitative structure activity relation; review","","","","","National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (R01GM096967)","","Hansch C., Maloney P., Fujita T., Muir R., Correlation of Biological Activity of Phenoxyacetic Acids with Hammett Substituent Constants and Partition Coefficients, Nature, 194, pp. 178-180, (1962); Cramer R.D., The Inevitable QSAR Renaissance, J.

Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences’ dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex. © 2007 IEEE.","Model; Neural network; Object recognition; Scene understanding; Visual cortex","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomimetics; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Biological; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Visual Cortex; Biological systems; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Feedforward neural networks; Image matching; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; biomimetics; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; evaluation; human; image enhancement; methodology; pattern recognition; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; visual cortex; Feedforward models; Scene understanding; Visual cortex; Object recognition","","","","","Eugene McDermott Foundation; Honda Research Institute USA, Inc.; Komatsu Ltd.; Sumitomo Metal Industries; US Office of Naval Research; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Eastman Kodak; Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota","The authors would like to thank Sharat Chikkerur and Timothee Masquelier for useful comments on this manuscript.

Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","","Animals; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks (Computer); biological product; pembrolizumab; peptide derivative; antiproliferative activity; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep neural network; drug approval; drug industry; drug research; drug response; drug targeting; generative adversarial network; histopathology; human; intermethod comparison; machine learning; measurement accuracy; measurement repeatability; merkel cell carcinoma; natural language processing; nonhuman; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; prediction; priority journal; recurrent neural network; Review; RNA interference; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; unsupervised machine learning; animal; artificial neural network; drug design; drug development; procedures","","pembrolizumab, 1374853-91-4","","","U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, (I01BX004121)","","Mamoshina P., Et al., Machine learning on human muscle transcriptomic data for biomarker discovery and tissue-specific drug target identification, Front.

Due to the advances of powerful feature representations, machine-learning-based object detection is receiving increasing attention. Although numerous feature representations exist, most of them are handcrafted or shallow-learning-based features. As the object detection task becomes more challenging, their description capability becomes limited or even impoverished. More recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown their much stronger feature representation power in computer vision. Despite the progress made in nature scene images, it is problematic to directly use the CNN feature for object detection in optical remote sensing images because it is difficult to effectively deal with the problem of object rotation variations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to learn a rotation-invariant CNN (RICNN) model for advancing the performance of object detection, which is achieved by introducing and learning a new rotation-invariant layer on the basis of the existing CNN architectures. However, different from the training of traditional CNN models that only optimizes the multinomial logistic regression objective, our RICNN model is trained by optimizing a new objective function via imposing a regularization constraint, which explicitly enforces the feature representations of the training samples before and after rotating to be mapped close to each other, hence achieving rotation invariance. To facilitate training, we first train the rotation-invariant layer and then domain-specifically fine-tune the whole RICNN network to further boost the performance. Comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available ten-class object detection data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); machine learning; object detection; remote sensing images; rotation-invariant CNN (RICNN)","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Convolution; Feature extraction; Image reconstruction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Rotation; Comprehensive evaluation; Convolutional neural network; Feature representation; Multinomial logistic regression; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Rotation invariant; Very high resolution; algorithm; artificial neural network; computer vision; data set; deconvolution; detection method; image analysis; image resolution; machine learning; regression analysis; remote sensing; Object detection","","","","","Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of NPU, (CX201622); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61401357, 61473231); National Aerospace Science Foundation of China, (20140153003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3102016ZY023)","This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61401357 and Grant 61473231, by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 3102016ZY023, by the Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of NPU under Grant CX201622, and by the Aerospace Science Foundation of China under Grant 20140153003.","Han J., Zhang D., Cheng G., Guo L., Ren J., Object detection in optical remote sensing images based on weakly supervised learning and high-level feature learning, IEEE Trans.

The values can be missing due to problems in the acquisition process or because the user manually identified unwanted outliers. Our algorithm works even with a small amount of samples and it can propagate structure to fill larger missing regions. Our methodology is built on recent studies about matrix completion using the matrix trace norm. The contribution of our paper is to extend the matrix case to the tensor case by proposing the first definition of the trace norm for tensors and then by building a working algorithm. First, we propose a definition for the tensor trace norm that generalizes the established definition of the matrix trace norm. Second, similarly to matrix completion, the tensor completion is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Unfortunately, the straightforward problem extension is significantly harder to solve than the matrix case because of the dependency among multiple constraints. To tackle this problem, we developed three algorithms: simple low rank tensor completion (SiLRTC), fast low rank tensor completion (FaLRTC), and high accuracy low rank tensor completion (HaLRTC). The SiLRTC algorithm is simple to implement and employs a relaxation technique to separate the dependant relationships and uses the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to achieve a globally optimal solution; the FaLRTC algorithm utilizes a smoothing scheme to transform the original nonsmooth problem into a smooth one and can be used to solve a general tensor trace norm minimization problem; the HaLRTC algorithm applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to our problem. Our experiments show potential applications of our algorithms and the quantitative evaluation indicates that our methods are more accurate and robust than heuristic approaches. The efficiency comparison indicates that FaLTRC and HaLRTC are more efficient than SiLRTC and between FaLRTC and HaLRTC the former is more efficient to obtain a low accuracy solution and the latter is preferred if a high-accuracy solution is desired. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","sparse learning; Tensor completion; trace norm","Artifacts; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sample Size; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; Convex optimization; Heuristic methods; Matrix algebra; Acquisition process; Alternating direction methods; Convex optimization problems; Coordinate descent; Heuristic approach; High-accuracy; Low rank; Matrix case; Matrix completion; Matrix trace; Minimization problems; Missing values; Multiple constraint; Non-smooth; Optimal solutions; Potential applications; Quantitative evaluation; Relaxation techniques; sparse learning; Tensor completion; Trace-norms; Visual data; MLCS; MLOWN; article; artifact; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; methodology; sample size; signal processing; Tensors","","","","","","","Amit Y., Fink M., Srebro N., Ullman S., Uncovering shared structures in multiclass classification, Proc. 24th Int'l Conf.

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to ""travel"" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.

This definition differs from previous definitions whose goal is to either identify fixation points or detect the dominant object. In accordance with our saliency definition, we present a detection algorithm which is based on four principles observed in the psychological literature. The benefits of the proposed approach are evaluated in two applications where the context of the dominant objects is just as essential as the objects themselves. In image retargeting, we demonstrate that using our saliency prevents distortions in the important regions. In summarization, we show that our saliency helps to produce compact, appealing, and informative summaries. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","context aware.; Image saliency; visual saliency","Algorithms; Animals; Birds; Computer Graphics; Fishes; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Visual Perception; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Context-Aware; Detection algorithm; Fixation point; Image regions; Image retargeting; Image saliencies; Saliency detection; Visual saliency; algorithm; animal; article; bird; computer graphics; fish; human; image processing; methodology; vision; Object detection","","","","","Ollendorff Foundation; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","This work was supported by the Fund for the Promotion of Research at the Technion and by the Ollendorff Foundation.","Achanta R., Hemami S., Estrada F., Susstrunk S., Frequency-tuned salient region detection, Proc.

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer ""pre-training"" phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn good generative models and perform well on handwritten digit and visual object recognition tasks. © 2009 by the authors.","","Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Boltzmann machines; Data sets; Generative model; Handwritten digit; Hidden layers; Hidden variable; Layer-by-layers; Log likelihood; Pre-training; Single mode; Variational approximation; Variational inference; Visual object recognition; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Bengio Y., Le Cun Y., Scaling learning algorithms towards AI, Large-Scale Kernel Machines, (2007); Decoste D., Scholkopf B., Training invariant support vector machines, Machine Learning, 46, 1-3, (2002); Hinton G., Training products of experts by minimizing contrastive divergence, Neural Computation, 14, 8, pp. 1711-1800, (2002); Hinton G., Salakhutdinov R., Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks, Science, 313, 5786, pp. 504-507, (2006); Hinton G., Sejnowski T., Optimal perceptual inference, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (1983); Hinton G., Zemel R., Autoencoders, minimum description length and Helmholtz free energy, NIPS, 6, pp. 3-10, (1994); Hinton G., Osindero S., Teh Y.W., A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets, Neural Computation, 18, 7, pp. 1527-1554, (2006); Le Cun Y., Huang F., Bottou L., Learning methods for generic object recognition with invariance to pose and lighting, CVPR, 2, pp. 97-104, (2004); Nair V., Hinton G., Implicit mixtures of restricted Boltzmann machines, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 21, (2008); Neal R., Annealed importance sampling, Statistics and Computing, 11, pp. 125-139, (2001); Neal R., Connectionist learning of belief networks, Artif.

In this framework, called temporal constraint satisfaction problem (TCSP), variables represent time points and temporal information is represented by a set of unary and binary constraints, each specifying a set of permitted intervals. The unique feature of this framework lies in permitting the processing of metric information, namely, assessments of time differences between events. We present algorithms for performing the following reasoning tasks: finding all feasible times that a given event can occur, finding all possible relationships between two given events, and generating one or more scenarios consistent with the information provided. We distinguish between simple temporal problems (STPs) and general temporal problems, the former admitting at most one interval constraint on any pair of time points. We show that the STP, which subsumes the major part of Vilain and Kautz's point algebra, can be solved in polynomial time. For general TCSPs, we present a decomposition scheme that performs the three reasoning tasks considered, and introduce a variety of techniques for improving its efficiency. We also study the applicability of path consistency algorithms as preprocessing of temporal problems, demonstrate their termination and bound their complexities. © 1991.","","Computer Metatheory - Computational Complexity; Computer Programming - Algorithms; Mathematical Techniques - Graph Theory; Systems Science and Cybernetics - Cognitive Systems; Constraint Satisfaction; Network Based Algorithms; Path Consistency Algorithms; Point Algebra; Temporal Constraint Networks; Artificial Intelligence","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (8815522); National Science Foundation, NSF; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (90 0136); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR","*This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Grant #IRI 8815522, and by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR 90 0136. **Present address: Information and Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.","Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, (1974); Allen, Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals, Commun.

Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting. © 2018, The Author(s).","","Aged; Clinical Decision-Making; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Referral and Consultation; Retina; Retinal Diseases; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Article; artificial intelligence; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; human; optical coherence tomography; patient referral; priority journal; retina disease; three dimensional imaging; aged; clinical decision making; female; male; middle aged; pathology; patient referral; retina; retina disease","","","","","NIHR Moorfields Clinical Research Facility; UCL Institute of Ophthalmology; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology","We thank K.

In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification. The RNN-IDS model improves the accuracy of the intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection. © 2017 IEEE.","deep learning; intrusion detection; machine learning; Recurrent neural networks; RNN-IDS","Artificial intelligence; Bins; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Network security; Neural networks; Personnel training; Recurrent neural networks; Security of data; Support vector machines; Testing; Binary classification; Classification models; Computational model; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning classification; Machine learning methods; Multi-class classification; RNN-IDS; Intrusion detection","","","","","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2016YFB0801505, 2016YFB0801601); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016YFB0801601 and 2016YFB0801505.","LeCun Y., Bengio Y., Hinton G., Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Schmidhuber J., Deep learning in neural networks: An overview, Neural Netw., 61, 2015, pp. 85-117; Liu L., Shao L., Li X., Lu K., Learning spatio-temporal represen-tations for action recognition: A genetic programming approach, IEEE Trans.

Detecting rare events can be viewed as a prediction task in data mining and machine learning communities. As these events are rarely observed in daily life, the prediction task suffers from a lack of balanced data. In this paper, we provide an in depth review of rare event detection from an imbalanced learning perspective. Five hundred and seventeen related papers that have been published in the past decade were collected for the study. The initial statistics suggested that rare events detection and imbalanced learning are concerned across a wide range of research areas from management science to engineering. We reviewed all collected papers from both a technical and a practical point of view. Modeling methods discussed include techniques such as data preprocessing, classification algorithms and model evaluation. For applications, we first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the existing application domains of imbalanced learning, and then we detail the applications for each category. Finally, some suggestions from the reviewed papers are incorporated with our experiences and judgments to offer further research directions for the imbalanced learning and rare event detection fields. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining;

To address the problem of the lack of training templates, we also propose a novel approach for human recognition by combining statistical gait features from real and synthetic templates. We directly compute the real templates from training silhouette sequences, while we generate the synthetic templates from training sequences by simulating silhouette distortion. We use a statistical approach for learning effective features from real and synthetic templates. We compare the proposed GEI-based gait recognition approach with other gait recognition approaches on USF HumanID Database. Experimental results show that the proposed GEI is an effective and efficient gait representation for individual recognition, and the proposed approach achieves highly competitive performance with respect to the published gait recognition approaches. © 2006 IEEE.","Distortion analysis; Feature fusion; Gait recognition; Performance evaluation; Real and synthetic templates; Video","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Gait; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Joints; Models, Biological; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Video Recording; Database systems; Feature extraction; Image recognition; Learning systems; Statistical methods; Gait Energy Image (GEI); Gait recognition; Gait representation; Performance evaluation; Synthetic templates; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; biometry; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; gait; histology; human; information retrieval; joint; methodology; photography; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; videorecording; Gait analysis","","","","","US government","This work was supported in part by grants F49620-02-1-0315 and DAAD19-01-0357; the contents and information do not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the US government.

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge. © 2010 IEEE.","color; evaluation/methodology; Image/video retrieval; invariants; pattern recognition","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Color; Colorimetry; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Feature extraction; Object recognition; Video cameras; Visual communication; Category recognition; Color descriptors; Color invariants; Data sets; Descriptors; Evaluation/methodology; Illumination conditions; Illumination invariance; Image domain; Image/video retrieval; Intensity-based; Light color; Light intensity; Photometric transformation; Prior knowledge; Salient points; Scene recognition; Visual information; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; color; colorimetry; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Color","","","","","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research","This work was supported by the EC-FP6 VIDI-Video project.","Datta R., Joshi D., Li J., Wang J.Z., Image retrieval: Ideas, influences, and trends of the new age, ACM Computing Surveys, 40, 2, pp. 1-60, (2008); Fergus R., Fei-Fei L., Perona P., Zisserman A., Learning object categories from Google's image search, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, II, pp. 1816-1823, (2005); Lazebnik S., Schmid C., Ponce J., Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories, Proc.

In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of 'is there information about a variable of interest' (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely 'where is the information' (pattern localization) and 'how is that information encoded' (pattern characterization).","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Software; MLCS; MLOWN; algorithm; artificial intelligence; computer program; human; image processing; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; review","","","","","National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (R01NS053366); W.

This article presents a family of probabilistic localization algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted hypotheses (samples), which approximate the posterior under a common Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. Building on the basic MCL algorithm, this article develops a more robust algorithm called Mixture-MCL, which integrates two complimentary ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm to mobile robots equipped with range finders, a kernel density tree is learned that permits fast sampling. Systematic empirical results illustrate the robustness and computational efficiency of the approach. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Kernel density trees; Localization; Mobile robots; Particle filters; Position estimation","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Mobile robots; Monte Carlo methods; Motion planning; Probabilistic logics; Robot programming; Robustness (control systems); Trees (mathematics); Bayesian theory; Probabilistic localization algorithms; Artificial intelligence","","","","","DARPA-ATO, (DAAE07-98-C-L032); DARPA-ISO, (F30602-98-2-0137); National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS-9876136, IIS-9877033); Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (9876136, 9877033)","This research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (and CAREER grant number IIS-9876136 and regular grant number IIS-9877033), and by DARPA-ATO via TACOM (contract number DAAE07-98-C-L032) and DARPA-ISO via Rome Labs (contract number F30602-98-2-0137), which is gratefully acknowledged.

They form a canonical representation, making testing of functional properties such as satisfiability and equivalence straightforward. A number of operations on Boolean functions can be implemented as graph algorithms on OBDD data structures. Using OBDDs, a wide variety of problems can be solved through symbolic analysis. First, the possible variations in system parameters and operating conditions are encoded with Boolean variables. Then the system is evaluated for all variations by a sequence of OBDD operations. Researchers have thus solved a number of problems in digital-system design, finite-state system analysis, artificial intelligence, and mathematical logic. This paper describes the OBDD data structure and surveys a number of applications that have been solved by OBDD-based symbolic analysis. © 1992, ACM.

Traditional convolutional GAXs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work1, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fréhet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape. © 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2019.

For this purpose, we have been constructing a knowledge base by organizing various experimental and computational observations as a collection of if-then rules. Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66% of the training data and 59% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system. This artificial intelligence approach is powerful and flexible enough to be used in genome analyses. © 1992 Academic Press, Inc.

Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology. © 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The extracted features are often derived from the output of pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) systems, which leads to the propagation of the errors in the existing tools and hinders the performance of these systems. In this paper, we exploit a convolutional deep neural network (DNN) to extract lexical and sentence level features. Our method takes all of the word tokens as input without complicated pre-processing. First, the word tokens are transformed to vectors by looking up word embeddings1. Then, lexical level features are extracted according to the given nouns. Meanwhile, sentence level features are learned using a convolutional approach. These two level features are concatenated to form the final extracted feature vector. Finally, the features are fed into a softmax classifier to predict the relationship between two marked nouns. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computational linguistics;

Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1994.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Census transforms; Conventional methods; Correspondence problems; Image Structures; Intensity values; Normalized correlation; Object boundaries; Synthetic and real data; Computer vision","","","","","Stanford University, SU; Hertz Foundation","Portions of this work were done while the first author was at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, supported by a fellowship from the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation.

Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Clustering; Extreme learning machine; Feature learning; Regression","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical engineering; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Computer control systems; Data handling; Knowledge acquisition; Clustering; Extreme learning machine; Feature learning; Generalization performance; Hardware implementations; Implementation aspects; Regression; Universal approximation; accuracy; classification algorithm; computer model; computer prediction; extreme learning machine; image processing; intermethod comparison; kernel method; learning algorithm; machine learning; regression analysis; Review; support vector machine; trend study; algorithm; artificial intelligence; classification; standards; trends; Machine learning","","","","","National Key Technology R&D Program, (2012BAF01B03, DY125-25-02); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program, (20131089300); National Natural Science Foundation of China, (41427806, 61273233); Doctoral Program Foundation of Institutions of Higher Education of China, (20120002110035, 20130002130010)","This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61273233 and 41427806 , the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education under Grant Nos. 20120002110035 and 20130002130010 , the National Key Technology R&D Program under Grant 2012BAF01B03 , the Project of China Ocean Association under Grant DY125-25-02, and Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program under Grant 20131089300.

Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 × 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors. © 2008 IEEE.","Internet images; Large data sets; Nearest neighbor methods; Object recognition; Tiny images","Artificial Intelligence; Database Management Systems; Databases, Factual; Documentation; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Pattern Recognition, Automated; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; data base; documentation; factual database; image enhancement; information retrieval; Internet; methodology","","","","","Shell Research; US Office of Naval Research MURI, (N00014-06-1-0734); National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS0747120); National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NGA, (NEGI-1582-04-0004); Google","Funding for this research was provided by NGA NEGI-1582-04-0004, Shell Research, Google, US Office of Naval Research MURI Grant N00014-06-1-0734, and US National Science Foundation Career Award IIS0747120.","Bachmann T., Identification of Spatially Quantized Tachistoscopic Images of Faces: How Many Pixels Does It Take to Carry Identity, European J.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy-that is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actorcritic formulation, our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior onpolicy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds. © 2018 by authors.All right reserved.","","Artificial intelligence;

Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we report data on the relationships among intrinsic disorder, sequence complexity as measured by Shannon's entropy, and amino acid composition. Intrinsic disorder identified in protein crystal structures, and by nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and prediction from amino acid sequence, all exhibit similar complexity distributions that are shifted to lower values compared to, but significantly overlapping with, the distribution for ordered proteins. Compared to sequences from ordered proteins, these variously characterized intrinsically disordered segments and proteins, and also a collection of low-complexity sequences, typically have obviously higher levels of protein-specific subsets of the following amino acids: R, K, E, P, and S, and lower levels of subsets of the following: C, W, Y, I, and V. The Swiss Protein database of sequences exhibits significantly higher amounts of both low-complexity and predicted-to-be-disordered segments as compared to a non-redundant set of sequences from the Protein Data Bank, providing additional data that nature is richer in disordered and low-complexity segments compared to the commonness of these features in the set of structurally characterized proteins. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Neural network predictors; Protein disorder; Sequence complexity","Artificial Intelligence; Base Sequence; Databases, Factual; Models, Molecular; Protein Denaturation; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proteins; Thermodynamics; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; article; circular dichroism; crystal structure; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; protein defect; protein folding; protein localization; protein structure","","Proteins, ","","","U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM, (R01LM006916)","","Anfinsen C.B., Principles that govern the folding of protein chains, Science, 181, pp. 223-230, (1973); Mirsky A.E., Pauling L., On the structure of native, denatured and coagulated proteins, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 22, pp. 439-447, (1936); May A.C., Johnson M.S., Rufino S.D., Wako H., Zhu Z.Y., Sowdhamini R., Srinivasan N., Rodionov M.A., Blundell T.L., The recognition of protein structure and function from sequence: Adding value to genome data, Phil Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 344, pp. 373-381, (1994); Koonin E.V., Tatusov R.L., Galperin M.Y., Beyond complete genomes: From sequence to structure and function, Curr Opin Struct Biol, 8, pp. 355-363, (1998); Orengo C.A., Todd A.E., From protein structure to function, Curr Opin Struct Biol, 3, pp. 374-382, (1999); Fischer E., Einfluss der configuration auf die wirkung derenzyme, Ber Dt Chem Ges, 27, pp. 2985-2993, (1894); Koshland D.E.

More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like “cause,” are used, Distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgments of Distance significantly correlate with the distance judgments that people make and help us determine whether semantic net S1 is better or worse than semantic net S2. First a “conceptual distance” task is set, and people are asked to perform it. Then the same task is performed by Distance on S1 and S2. If Distance on S1 performs more like people than Distance on S2, the conclusion is that S1 is better than S2. Distance embedded in the methodology facilitates repeatable quantitative experiments. © 1989 IEEE","","Artificial Intelligence; Information Science--Information Retrieval; Conceptual Distance; Hierarchical Knowledge Base; Hierarchical Semantic Net; Semantic Nets; Shortest Path Lengths; Systems Science and Cybernetics","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECS-84-06683)","Manuscript received May 10, 1987; revised February 24, 1988 and August 29, 1988.

In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that primates can learn to reach and grasp virtual objects by controlling a robot arm through a closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMIc) that uses multiple mathematical models to extract several motor parameters (i.e., hand position, velocity, gripping force, and the EMGs of multiple arm muscles) from the electrical activity of frontoparietal neuronal ensembles. As single neurons typically contribute to the encoding of several motor parameters, we observed that high BMIc accuracy required recording from large neuronal ensembles. Continuous BMIc operation by monkeys led to significant improvements in both model predictions and behavioral performance. Using visual feedback, monkeys succeeded in producing robot reach-and-grasp movements even when their arms did not move. Learning to operate the BMIc was paralleled by functional reorganization in multiple cortical areas, suggesting that the dynamic properties of the BMIc were incorporated into motor and sensory cortical representations.","","Animals; Arm; Artificial Intelligence; Behavior, Animal; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Brain; Brain Mapping; Electromyography; Electrophysiology; Female; Hand; Hand Strength; Learning; Macaca; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Motor Activity; Motor Cortex; Movement; Neurons; Primates; Psychomotor Performance; Robotics; Somatosensory Cortex; Space Perception; Time Factors; Animalia; Primates; animal experiment; article; brain cortex; brain function; cell population; electromyogram; feedback system; female; hypothesis; learning; mathematical model; nerve cell; nonhuman; primate; statistical model; task performance; animal; animal behavior; arm; artificial intelligence; biological model; biomechanics; biophysics; brain; brain mapping; depth perception; electromyography; electrophysiology; hand; hand grip; learning; Macaca; metabolism; methodology; motor activity; motor cortex; movement (physiology); pathology; physiology; psychomotor performance; robotics; somatosensory cortex; theoretical model; time","","","","","","","Alexander G.E., Crutcher M.D., Neural representations of the target (goal) of visually guided arm movements in three motor areas of the monkey, J Neurophysiol, 64, pp. 164-178, (1990); Birbaumer N., Ghanayim N., Hinterberger T., Iversen I., Kotchoubey B., Et al., A spelling device for the paralysed, Nature, 398, pp. 297-298, (1999); Bomze H.M., Bulsara K.R., Iskandar B.J., Caroni P., Skene J.H., Spinal axon regeneration evoked by replacing two growth cone proteins in adult neurons, Nat Neurosci, 4, pp. 38-43, (2001); Bunge M.B., Bridging areas of injury in the spinal cord, Neuroscientist, 7, pp. 325-339, (2001); Burnod Y., Baraduc P., Battaglia-Mayer A., Guigon E., Koechlin E., Et al., Parieto-frontal coding of reaching: An integrated framework, Exp Brain Res, 129, pp. 325-346, (1999); Chapin J.K., Moxon K.A., Markowitz R.S., Nicolelis M.A.L., Real-time control of a robot arm using simultaneously recorded neurons in the motor cortex, Nat Neurosci, 2, pp. 664-670, (1999); Donoghue J.P., Connecting cortex to machines: Recent advances in brain interfaces, Nat Neurosci Supp, 5, pp. 1085-1088, (2002); Fetz E.E., Operant conditioning of cortical unit activity, Science, 163, pp. 955-957, (1969); Fetz E.E., Are movement parameters recognizably coded in activity of single neurons?, Behav Brain Sci, 15, pp. 679-690, (1992); Fetz E.E., Baker M.A., Operantly conditioned patterns of precentral unit activity and correlated responses in adjacent cells and contralateral muscles, J Neurophysiol, 36, pp. 179-204, (1973); Fetz E.E., Finocchio D.V., Operant conditioning of specific patterns of neural and muscular activity, Science, 174, pp. 431-435, (1971); Fetz E.E., Finocchio D.V., Correlations between activity of motor cortex cells and arm muscles during operantly conditioned response patterns, Exp Brain Res, 23, pp. 217-240, (1975); Georgopoulos A.P., Lurito J.T., Petrides M., Schwartz A.B., Massey J.T., Mental rotation of the neuronal population vector, Science, 243, pp. 234-236, (1989); Johnson M.T.V., Mason C.R., Ebner T.J., Central processes for the multiparametric control of arm movements in primates, Curr Opin Neurobiol, 11, pp. 684-688, (2001); Kakei S., Hoffman D.S., Strick P.L., Muscle and movement representations in the primary motor cortex, Science, 285, pp. 2136-2139, (1999); Kennedy P.R., King B., Dynamic interplay of neural signals during the emergence of cursor related cortex in a human implanted with the neurotrophic electrode, Neural Prostheses for Restoration of Sensory and Motor Functions, pp. 221-233, (2000); Iriki A., Tanaka M., Iwamura Y., Coding of modified body schema during tool use by macaque postcentral neurones, Neuroreport, 7, pp. 2325-2330, (1996); Lebedev M.A., Wise S.P., Tuning for the orientation of spatial attention in dorsal premotor cortex, Eur J Neurosci, 13, pp. 1002-1008, (2001); Li C.S., Padoa-Schioppa C., Bizzi E., Neuronal correlates of motor performance and motor learning in the primary motor cortex of monkeys adapting to an external force field, Neuron, 30, pp. 593-607, (2001); Messier J., Kalaska J.F., Covariation of primate dorsal premotor cell activity with direction and amplitude during a memorized-delay reaching task, J Neurophysiol, 84, pp. 152-165, (2000); Mussa-Ivaldi F.A., Do neurons in the motor cortex encode movement direction?: An alternative hypothesis, Neurosci Lett, 91, pp. 106-111, (1988); Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

In this article, we present our vision of what 6G will be and describe usage scenarios and requirements for multi-terabyte per second (Tb/s) and intelligent 6G networks. We present a large-dimensional and autonomous network architecture that integrates space, air, ground, and underwater networks to provide ubiquitous and unlimited wireless connectivity. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning [1], [2] for autonomous networks and innovative air-interface design. Finally, we identify several promising technologies for the 6G ecosystem, including terahertz (THz) communications, very-large-scale antenna arrays [i.e., supermassive (SM) multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO)], large intelligent surfaces (LISs) and holographic beamforming (HBF), orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing, laser and visible-light communications (VLC), blockchain-based spectrum sharing, quantum communications and computing, molecular communications, and the Internet of Nano-Things. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Beam forming networks; Network architecture; Queueing networks; Wireless networks; Intelligent information; Molecular communication; Orbital angular momentum; Services and applications; Terahertz(THz) communications; Underwater networks; Visible light communications (VLC); Wireless connectivities; 5G mobile communication systems","","","","","Sichuan Science and Techology Program, (2017HH0035, 61501382); Swedish Strategic Research Foundation; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (6161101297, 61731017, 61871334); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2682018CX27); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (111-2-14)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Key Project under grant 61731017, the NSFC Project under grant 61871334, the NSFC China-Swedish Project under grant 6161101297, and the 111 Project under grant 111-2-14.

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Mammography; Reproducibility of Results; United Kingdom; United States; United States; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; cancer; detection method; disease treatment; performance assessment; Article; artificial intelligence; breast biopsy; breast cancer; cancer classification; cancer screening; clinical decision making; clinical practice; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; digital breast tomosynthesis; false negative result; false positive result; histopathology; human; mammography; predictive value; priority journal; radiologist; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; United Kingdom; United States; workload; artificial intelligence; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; female; procedures; reproducibility","","","","","Google LLC; Google; Office of Extramural Research, National Institutes of Health, OER; Manchester Biomedical Research Centre, BRC; NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, BRC","Funding text 1: Competing interests This study was funded by Google LLC and/or a subsidiary thereof (‘Google’).

Linear models are probably the most frequently used methods for assessing feature relevance, despite their relative inflexibility. However, in the past years effective estimators of feature relevance have been derived for highly complex or non-parametric models such as support vector machines and RandomForest (RF) models. Recently, it has been observed that RF models are biased in such a way that categorical variables with a large number of categories are preferred. Results: In this work, we introduce a heuristic for normalizing feature importance measures that can correct the feature importance bias. The method is based on repeated permutations of the outcome vector for estimating the distribution of measured importance for each variable in a non-informative setting. The P-value of the observed importance provides a corrected measure of feature importance. We apply our method to simulated data and demonstrate that (i) non-informative predictors do not receive significant P-values, (ii) informative variables can successfully be recovered among non-informative variables and (iii) P-values computed with permutation importance (PIMP) are very helpful for deciding the significance of variables, and therefore improve model interpretability. Furthermore, PIMP was used to correct RF-based importance measures for two real-world case studies. We propose an improved RF model that uses the significant variables with respect to the PIMP measure and show that its prediction accuracy is superior to that of other existing models.

The assumption that natural signals, such as images, admit a sparse decomposition over a redundant dictionary leads to efficient algorithms for handling such sources of data. In particular, the design of well adapted dictionaries for images has been a major challenge. The K-SVD has been recently proposed for this task and shown to perform very well for various grayscale image processing tasks. In this paper, we address the problem of learning dictionaries for color images and extend the K-SVD-based grayscale image denoising algorithm that appears in. This work puts forward ways for handling nonhomogeneous noise and missing information, paving the way to state-of-the-art results in applications such as color image denoising, demosaicing, and inpainting, as demonstrated in this paper. © 2007 IEEE.","Color processing; Demosaicing; Denoising; Image decomposition; Image processing; Image representations; Inpainting; Sparse representation","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Color; Colorimetry; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Data handling; Image reconstruction; Imaging systems; Learning algorithms; Singular value decomposition; Color processing; Demosaicing; Denoising; Image decomposition; Image representations; Inpainting; Sparse representation; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; color; colorimetry; computer assisted diagnosis; image enhancement; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Color","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; National Gallery of Art, NGA; McKnight Foundation; Israel Science Foundation, ISF, (796/05)","Manuscript received October 23, 2006; revised October 8, 2007.

There are characterization of these languages in terms of recursion equation sets which involve both minimal and maximal fixpoint operators. The class of ω-regular languages is closed under a fair concurrency operator.

The method produces segmentations by classifying each image pixel as vessel or nonvessel, based on the pixel's feature vector. Feature vectors are composed of the pixel's intensity and two-dimensional Gabor wavelet transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Gabor wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE (Staal et al., 2004) and STARE (Hoover et al., 2000) databases of manually labeled images. On the DRIVE database, it achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9614, being slightly superior than that presented by state-of-the-art approaches. We are making our implementation available as open source MATLAB scripts for researchers interested in implementation details, evaluation, or development of methods. © 2006 IEEE.","Fundus; Gabor; Pattern classification; Retina; Vessel segmentation; Wavelet","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Vessels; Retinoscopy; Sensitivity and Specificity; Classification (of information); Image analysis; Mathematical models; Pattern recognition; Probability density function; Vector quantization; Vision; Wavelet transforms; Fundus; Gabor; Retina; Vessel segmentation; Wavelet; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; histology; human; image enhancement; information retrieval; methodology; reproducibility; retina blood vessel; retinoscopy; sensitivity and specificity; Image segmentation","","","","","Australian Diabetes Association; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2005/00587-5); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (131403/2004-4, 300722/98-2, 474596/2004-4, 491323/2005-0)","Manuscript received February 2, 2006; revised May 22, 2006.

Wyspiańskiego 27, Wrocław, 50-370, Poland","Despite more than two decades of continuous development learning from imbalanced data is still a focus of intense research. Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them. © 2016, The Author(s).","Big data; Data streams; Imbalanced clustering; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced regression; Machine learning; Multi-class imbalance","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer hardware description languages; Data mining; Learning systems; Class imbalance; Data stream; Imbalanced clustering; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced regression; Big data","","","","","Polish National Science Center, (DEC-2013/09/B/ST6/02264)","This work is supported by the Polish National Science Center under the Grant no.

However, feature selection is a challenging task due mainly to the large search space. A variety of methods have been applied to solve feature selection problems, where evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have recently gained much attention and shown some success. However, there are no comprehensive guidelines on the strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches. This leads to a disjointed and fragmented field with ultimately lost opportunities for improving performance and successful applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art work on EC for feature selection, which identifies the contributions of these different algorithms. In addition, current issues and challenges are also discussed to identify promising areas for future research. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Classification; data mining; evolutionary computation; feature selection; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Calculations; Classification (of information); Data mining; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Surveys; Classification algorithm; Feature selection problem; Improving performance; Issues and challenges; Lost opportunities; Search spaces; State of the art; Feature extraction","","","","","Marsden Fund of the New Zealand Government, (VUW1209); University Research Fund, (209861/3580, 210375/3557); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/J017515/1); Royal Society; Royal Society Te Apārangi; Victoria University of Wellington, WGTN; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61329302)","Manuscript received February 10, 2015; revised June 27, 2015 and September 15, 2015; accepted November 18, 2015.

This paper presents a systematic survey of the common processing steps and core decision rules in modern change detection algorithms, including significance and hypothesis testing, predictive models, the shading model, and background modeling. We also discuss important preprocessing methods, approaches to enforcing the consistency of the change mask, and principles for evaluating and comparing the performance of change detection algorithms. It is hoped that our classification of algorithms into a relatively small number of categories will provide useful guidance to the algorithm designer. © 2005 IEEE.","Background modeling; Change detection; Change mask; Hypothesis testing; Illumination invariance; Mixture models; Predictive models; Shading model; Significance testing","Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Data Collection; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Biological; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Subtraction Technique; Algorithms; High pass filters; Mathematical models; Mathematical transformations; Polynomials; Principal component analysis; Probability; algorithm; animal; article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biological model; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation; human; image enhancement; image subtraction; information processing; information retrieval; mathematical computing; methodology; signal processing; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Background modeling; Change detection; Change mask; Hypothesis testing; Illumination invariance; Mixture models; Predictive models; Shading model; Significance testing; Image processing","","","","","National Science Foundation Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems; National Science Foundation, NSF, (EEC-9986821); National Science Foundation, NSF; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, RPI","Manuscript received November 25, 2003; revised August 3, 2004.

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided. © 2008 IEEE.","Distributed control; Game theory; Multiagent systems; Reinforcement learning","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Game theory; Reinforcement learning; Learning dynamics; Multiagent reinforcement learning; Representative selection; Multi agent systems","","","","","Ministerie van Economische Zaken, EZ, (BSIK03024)","Manuscript received November 10, 2006; revised March 7, 2007 and June 18, 2007.
