Recently, manufacturing bio-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces has become an increasingly hot research topic. The electrospinning technique is a versatile and effective method for manufacturing nanomaterials with controllable compositions and structures, and therefore provides an ideal strategy for construction of superhydrophobic surfaces on a large scale. After a brief description of several superhydrophobic surfaces inspired by nature, we highlighted the recent progresses in design and fabrication of these bio-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces via electrospinning technique. The studies on the switchable wettability of nanofibrous surface brought about by external stimuli are also addressed. We conclude with a summary of current and future research efforts and opportunities in the development of electrospun nanomaterials for superhydrophobic applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomimetic; Electrospinning; Electrospun nanomaterials; Micro- and nanofibrous membranes; Superhydrophobic surfaces; Wettability","Biomimetics; Electrospinning; Industrial research; Manufacture; Nanofibers; Surface properties; Wetting; inorganic compound; Janus kinase; molecular scaffold; nanomaterial; Bio-inspired; Electrospinning techniques; Electrospuns; External stimulus; Functional surfaces; Hot research topics; Micro- and nanofibrous membranes; Recent progress; Research efforts; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Switchable; anisotropy; biomimetics; chemical modification; dominance behavior; electrospinning; goose; hydrophobicity; hydrothermal vent; insect; leaf surface; Lotus; membrane fluidity; natural science; nonhuman; photostimulation; review; scanning electron microscopy; temperature sensitivity; watermelon; wettability; Hydrophobicity","","Janus kinase, 161384-16-3","","","Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology, (10JC1400600); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (50803009); Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, (10SG32, 11ZZ59); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2011CB606103); “111 Project, (111-2-04, B07024)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 50803009 ), the “111 Project” (no. 111-2-04 and B07024), the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology (no. 10JC1400600 ), the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2011CB606103 ), the Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission ( 11ZZ59 ), and the “Dawn” Program of Shanghai Education Commission ( 10SG32 ).

Job shop scheduling is an important task for manufacturing industry in terms of improving machine utilization and reducing cycle-time. However, job shop scheduling is inherently a NP-hard problem with no easy solution. This paper describes a novel approach that uses the honey bees foraging model to solve the job shop scheduling problem.

A way to avoid wasting energy and thus reducing the carbon print of an industrial plant is to consider minimisation of energy consumption objective while making scheduling decisions. To minimise energy consumption, the decision maker has to decide the timing and length of turn off/turn on operation (a setup) and also provide a sequence of jobs that minimises the scheduling objective, assuming that all jobs are not available at the same time. In this paper, a framework to solve a multiobjective optimisation problem that minimises total energy consumption and total tardiness is proposed. Since total tardiness problem with release dates is an NP-hard problem, a new greedy randomised multiobjective adaptive search metaheuristic is utilised to obtain an approximate pareto front (i.e. an approximate set of non-dominated solutions). Analytical Hierarchy Process is utilised to determine the 'best' alternative among the solutions on the pareto front. The proposed framework is illustrated in a case study. It is shown that a wide variety of dispersed solutions can be obtained via the proposed framework, and as total tardiness decreases, total energy consumption increases. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","Energy efficient production planning; Multiobjective grasp; Single-machine scheduling; Sustainable/green manufacturing","Computational complexity; Energy utilization; Industrial plants; Machinery; Multiobjective optimization; Planning; Production control; Production engineering; Scheduling; Adaptive search; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Decision makers; Energy consumption; Energy efficient; Metaheuristic; Multi objective; Multiobjective grasp; Multiobjective optimisation; Nondominated solutions; NP-HARD problem; Pareto front; Release date; Scheduling decisions; Single machines; Single-machine scheduling; Sustainable/green manufacturing; Total energy consumption; Total tardiness; Manufacture","","","","","","","Aiex R.M., Binato S., Resende M.G.C., Parallel GRASP With Path-relinking For Job Shop Scheduling, (2001); Armentano V.A., Araujo O.C.B., Grasp with memory-based mechanisms for minimizing total tardiness in single machine scheduling with setup times, Journal of Heuristics, 12, 6, pp. 427-446, (2006); Binato S., Hery W.J., Loewenstern D.M., Resende M.G.C., (2000); Regional Electricity Emission Factors Final Report, (1998); Chu C., A branch-and-bound algorithm to minimize total tardiness with different release dates, Naval Research Logistics, 39, pp. 265-283, (1992); Drake R., Yildirim M.B., Twomey J., Whitman L., Ahmad J., Lodhia P., Data collection framework on energy consumption in manufacturing.

Existing monitoring systems and prognostics approaches are not capable of collecting the large volumes of real-time data or building large-scale predictive models that are essential to achieving significant advances in cyber-manufacturing. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new computational framework that enables remote real-time sensing, monitoring, and scalable high performance computing for diagnosis and prognosis. This framework utilizes wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and machine learning. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed to demonstrate how the framework can enable manufacturers to monitor machine health conditions and generate predictive analytics. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate capabilities and utility of the framework such as how vibrations and energy consumption of pumps in a power plant and CNC machines in a factory floor can be monitored using a wireless sensor network. In addition, a machine learning algorithm, implemented on a public cloud, is used to predict tool wear in milling operations. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Cyber-Manufacturing; Fog computing;

These models do not consider the presence of defective products in the lot or rework of them. Recently, Jamal, Sarker, and Mondal (Jamal, A. A. M., Sarker, B. R., & Mondal, S., (2004). Optimal manufacturing batch size with rework process at single-stage production system. Computers and Industrial Engineering, 47(1), 77-89) proposed a model, which dealt with the optimum batch quantity in a single-stage system in which rework is done by addressing two different operational policies to minimize the total system cost, but their models do not consider planned backorders. In this direction, this paper develops an EPQ type inventory model with planned backorders for determining the economic production quantity for a single product, which is manufactured in a single-stage manufacturing system that generates imperfect quality products, and all these defective products are reworked in the same cycle. We also establish the range of real values of the proportion of defective products for which there is an optimal solution, and the close form for the total cost of inventory system. The use of the inventory model is illustrated with numerical examples. The classical EOQ, EPQ inventory models with or without planned backorders and Jamal, Sarker and Mondal's model (Jamal, A. A. M., Sarker, B. R., & Mondal, S., (2004). Optimal manufacturing batch size with rework process at single-stage production system.

In particular, significant attention is being paid by companies, customers, media, and regulators to development and consumption of green products. It is argued that through the efficient use of resources, low carbon impacts, and risks to the environment, green products can be essential to help society toward the environmental sustainability targets. The number of green product introductions is rapidly increasing, as demonstrated by the growing number of companies obtaining eco-labels or third party certifications for their environmentally friendly products. Hundreds of companies representing most of the industries, such as Intel, SC Johnson, Clorox, Wal-Mart, and Hewlett-Packard, have recently introduced new green products, underlining the need to develop products that create both economic and environmental values for the firm and customers. A review of the literature shows that academic research on green product development has grown in interest. However, to date, only a few empirical studies have addressed the challenge of integrating environmental issues into new product development (NPD). Previous empirical works have mainly focused on a set of activities for the green product development process at the project level. After years of paying no or marginal attention to environmental sustainability issues, most of the companies now generally realize that it would require knowledge and competencies to develop green products on a regular basis. These knowledge and competencies can be varied, such as R&D, environmental know-how, clean technology/manufacturing process, building knowledge on measuring environmental performance of products, etc., that may be developed internally or can be integrated through external networks. Adopting a resource-based view of the firm, this article aims at (1) investigating the role of capabilities useful for companies to integrate knowledge and competencies from outside of the firm on green product development in terms of both manufacturing process and product design and (2) understanding whether green product development opens new product, market, and technology opportunities, as well as leads to better financial performance of NPD programs. To this end, a survey was conducted in two Italian manufacturing industries in which environmental issues are becoming increasingly important, namely textiles and upholstered furniture. A questionnaire was sent to 700 firms, and 102 useable questionnaires were returned. Results show that (1) companies engage in developing external integrative capabilities through the creation of collaborative networks with actors along the supply chain, the acquisition of technical know-how, and the creation of external knowledge links with actors outside the supply chain; (2) external knowledge links play a key role in the integration of environmental sustainability issues into the manufacturing process, whereas capabilities such as the acquisition of technical know-how and the creation of collaborative networks prove to be more important for integrating environmental issues into product design; and (3) the integration of environmental sustainability issues into NPD programs in terms of product design leads to the creation of new opportunities for firms, such as opening new markets, technologies, and product arenas, though not necessarily leading to improved financial performance of the NPD programs. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association.","","Commerce; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Industrial engineering; Mergers and acquisitions; Product design; Production engineering; Supply chains; Surveys; Technology transfer; Textile industry; Textiles; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Environmentally friendly products; Green product development; Integrative capabilities; Resource-based view of the firm; Technology opportunities; Third party certification; Product development","","","","","","","Albino V., Balice A., Dangelico R.M., Environmental strategies and green product development: The behaviours of sustainability-driven companies, Business Strategy and Environment, 18, 2, pp. 83-96, (2009); Allwood J.M., Laursen S.E., De Rodriguez C.M., Bocken N.M.P., Well Dressed? the Present and Future Sustainability of Clothing and Textiles in the United Kingdom, (2006); Ambec S., Lanoie P., Does it pay to be green?

Fundamentally, sustainable manufacturing relies on descriptive metrics, advanced decisionmaking, and public policy for implementation, evaluation, and feedback. In this paper, recent research into concepts, methods, and tools for sustainable manufacturing is explored. At the manufacturing process level, engineering research has addressed issues related to planning, development, analysis, and improvement of processes. At a manufacturing systems level, engineering research has addressed challenges relating to facility operation, production planning and scheduling, and supply chain design. Though economically vital, manufacturing processes and systems have retained the negative image of being inefficient, polluting, and dangerous. Industrial and academic researchers are reimagining manufacturing as a source of innovation to meet society's future needs by undertaking strategic activities focused on sustainable processes and systems. Despite recent developments in decision making and process- and systems-level research, many challenges and opportunities remain. Several of these challenges relevant to manufacturing process and system research, development, implementation, and education are highlighted.

The interaction between scientists with different disciplines will undoubtedly lead to the production of novel materials with tailored properties. The success of nanomanufacturing depends on the strong cooperation between academia and industry in order to be informed about current needs and future challenges, to design products directly transferred into the industrial sector. It is of paramount importance the selection of the appropriate method combining synthesis of nanomaterials with required properties and limited impurities as well as scalability of the technique. Their industrial use faces many obstacles as there is no suitable regulatory framework and guidance on safety requirements; specific provisions have yet to be established in EU legislation. Moreover, regulations related to the right of intellectual properties as well as the absence of an appropriate framework for patent registration are issues delaying the process of products' industrial application. The utilization of high-quality nanomaterials is now growing and coming to the industrial arena rendering them as the next generation attractive resources with promising applications. Undoubtedly, the existing gap between basic research relating nanomaterials and their application in real life will be overcome in the coming decade. © C.A.

Aluminium matrix composites are providing such superior properties which cannot be achieved by any existing monolithic material. Properties of aluminium matrix composite are highly influenced by nature of reinforcement which can be either in continuous or discontinuous fibre form. It also depends on the selection of processing techniques for the fabrication of aluminium matrix composites which depends on many factors including type of matrix and reinforcement, the degree of microstructural integrity desired and their structural, mechanical, electrochemical and thermal properties. Present paper reports an overview on synthesis routes, mechanical behavior and applications of aluminium matrix composites. Special focus is given to primary processing techniques for manufacturing of aluminium matrix composites. In the end, commercialization challenges, industrial aspects and future research directions are also briefed. © 2019 The Authors","Aluminium matrix composites (AMCs); Commercialization; Industrial applications; Mechanical behavior; Powder metallurgy; Stir casting","Industrial applications; Industrial research; Manufacture; Powder metallurgy; Reinforcement; Aluminium matrix composites; Commercialization; Engineering applications; Future research directions; Mechanical behavior; Microstructural integrity; Processing technique; Stir casting; Aluminum metallurgy","","","","","Qatar Foundation, QF; Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the UREP grant # UREP23-116-2-041 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

The recent introduction of electron beam melting (EBM) for the processing of titanium has led to a one step fabrication of porous custom titanium implants with controlled porosity to meet the requirements of the anatomy and functions at the region of implantation. This paper discusses an image based micro-structural analysis and the mechanical characterization of porous Ti6Al4V structures fabricated using the EBM rapid manufacturing process. SEM studies have indicated the complete melting of the powder material with no evidence of poor inter-layer bonding. Micro-CT scan analysis of the samples indicate well formed titanium struts and fully interconnected pores with porosities varying from 49.75%-70.32%. Compression tests of the samples showed effective stiffness values ranging from 0.57 (± 0.05) - 2.92 (± 0.17) GPa and compressive strength values of 7.28 (± 0.93) - 163.02 (± 11.98) MPa. For nearly the same porosity values of 49.75% and 50.75%, with a variation in only the strut thickness in the sample sets, the compressive stiffness and strength decreased significantly from 2.92 GPa to 0.57 GPa (80.5% reduction) and 163.02 MPa to 7.28 MPa (93.54 % reduction) respectively. The grain density of the fabricated Ti6Al4V structures was found to be 4.423 g/cm3 equivalent to that of dense Ti6Al4V parts fabricated using conventional methods. In conclusion, from a mechanical strength viewpoint, we have found that the porous structures produced by the electron beam melting process present a promising rapid manufacturing process for the direct fabrication of customized titanium implants for enabling personalized medicine. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Large-scale manufacturing of pharmaceutical antibodies is a complex activity that requires considerable effort in both process and analytical development. If a therapeutic protein cannot be stabilized adequately, it will lose partially or totally its therapeutic properties or even cause immunogenic reactions thus potentially further endangering the patients' health. The phenomenon of protein aggregation is a common issue that compromises the quality, safety, and efficacy of antibodies and can happen at different steps of the manufacturing process, including fermentation, purification, final formulation, and storage. Aggregate levels in drug substance and final drug product are a key factor when assessing quality attributes of the molecule, since aggregation might impact biological activity of the biopharmaceutical. In this review it is analyzed how aggregates are formed during monoclonal antibody industrial production, why they have to be removed and the manufacturing process steps that are designed to either minimize or remove aggregates in the final product. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aggregates; Manufacturing processing; Monoclonal antibody","Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biotechnology; Humans; Protein Denaturation; Protein Stability; Recombinant Proteins; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Aggregates; Allergies; Drug products; Industrial engineering; Mergers and acquisitions; Monoclonal antibodies; Production engineering; Surface plasmon resonance; buffer; monoclonal antibody; protein A; surfactant; Antibody manufacturing; Biological activities; Complex activity; Drug substances; Industrial production; Key factors; Large-scale manufacturing; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing processing; Protein aggregation; Quality attributes; Therapeutic products; Therapeutic properties; Therapeutic protein; cell culture; chromatography; drug manufacture; drug purification; drug storage; freezing; pH; protein aggregation; pump; review; thawing; ultrafiltration; Manufacture","","Antibodies, Monoclonal, ; Recombinant Proteins, ","","","","","Andrews J.M., Roberts C.J., A Lumry-Eyring nucleated-polymerization (LENP) model of protein aggregation kinetics I.

Hydraulic (chiefly portland) cement, the binding agent in concrete and most mortars, is an important construction material. Portland cement is made primarily from finely ground clinker, a manufactured intermediate product that is composed predominantly of hydraulically active calcium silicate minerals formed through high-temperature burning of limestone and other materials in a kiln. This process typically requires approximately 3 to 6 million Btu (3.2 to 6.3 GJ) of energy and 1.7 tons of raw materials (chiefly limestone) per ton (t) of clinker produced and is accompanied by significant emissions of, in particular, carbon dioxide (CO2), but also nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates. The overall level of CO2 output, about 1 ton/ton clinker, is almost equally contributed by the calcination of limestone and the combustion of fuels and makes the cement industry one of the top two manufacturing industry sources of this greenhouse gas. The enormous demand for cement and the large energy and raw material requirements of its manufacture allow the cement industry to consume a wide variety of waste raw materials and fuels and provide the industry with significant opportunities to symbiotically utilize large quantities of by-products of other industries. This article, the second in a two-part series, summarizes some of the environmental challenges and opportunities facing the cement manufacturing industry. In the companion article, the chemistry, technology, raw materials, and energy requirements of cement manufacture were summarized. Because of the size and scope of the U.S. cement industry, the article relies primarily on data and practices from the United States.","Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Clinker; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Industrial symbiosis; Portland cement","Cement manufacture; Ecology; Greenhouse effect; Hydraulics; Limestone; Portland cement; Nonfuel materials; Industrial engineering","","","","","","","Alves P.R., Varied applications of waste and tailings: Case analysis of a low grade, hard rock Brazilian phosphate mine, Proc.

However, the biological complexity of cells has hampered the translation of laboratory-scale experiments into industrial processes for reliable, cost-effective manufacturing of cell-based therapies. We argue here that a solution to this challenge is to design cell manufacturing processes according to quality-by-design (QbD) principles. QbD integrates scientific knowledge and risk analysis into manufacturing process development and is already being adopted by the biopharmaceutical industry. Many opportunities to incorporate QbD into cell therapy manufacturing exist, although further technology development is required for full implementation. Linking measurable molecular and cellular characteristics of a cell population to final product quality through QbD is a crucial step in realizing the potential for cell therapies to transform healthcare.","","Biopharmaceutics; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Humans; Quality Control; Research Design; Risk Assessment; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Cells; Cost effectiveness; Diseases; Manufacture; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; chimeric antigen receptor; T lymphocyte receptor; Biological complexity; Biopharmaceutical industry; Cell based therapies; Industrial processs; Manufacturing process; Scientific knowledge; Technology development; Therapeutic agents; bioreactor; cell culture; cell population; cell viability; drug industry; drug manufacture; genetic engineering; health care; heart muscle cell; hematopoietic stem cell; human; in vitro study; karyotype; mesenchymal stroma cell; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; process design; process development; process monitoring; product safety; progenitor cell line; quality by design; regenerative medicine; Review; risk assessment; stem cell expansion; stem cell transplantation; biological therapy; methodology; pharmaceutics; procedures; quality control; standards; Cytology","","","","","Canada Research Chair in Stem Cell Bioengineering; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Y.Y.L. is supported by an NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship, and P.W.Z. is supported as the Canada Research Chair in Stem Cell Bioengineering.","Kirouac D.C., Zandstra P.W., The systematic production of cells for cell therapies, Cell Stem Cell, 3, pp. 369-381, (2008); Guidance for Industry: Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development; Rathore A.S., Winkle H., Quality by design for biopharmaceuticals, Nat.

The increasing awareness about the environment has tremendously contributed to the concerns related with disposal of the generated wastes. Solid waste management is one of the major environmental concerns in the world. With the scarcity of space for landfilling and due to its ever increasing cost, waste utilization has become an attractive alternative to disposal. Research is being carried out on the utilization of waste products in concrete. Such waste products include discarded tires, plastic, glass, steel, burnt foundry sand, and coal combustion by-products (CCBs). Each of these waste products has provided a specific effect on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The use of waste products in concrete not only makes it economical, but also helps in reducing disposal problems. Reuse of bulky wastes is considered the best environmental alternative for solving the problem of disposal. One such waste is plastic, which could be used in various applications. However, efforts have also been made to explore its use in concrete/asphalt concrete. The development of new construction materials using recycled plastics is important to both the construction and the plastic recycling industries. This paper presents a detailed review about waste and recycled plastics, waste management options, and research published on the effect of recycled plastic on the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. The effect of recycled and waste plastic on bulk density, air content, workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, impact resistance, permeability, and abrasion resistance is discussed in this paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Bone tissue engineering is seen as a means of developing alternatives to conventional bone grafts for repairing or reconstructing bone defects by combining biomaterials, cells and signalling factors. However, skeletal tissue engineering has not yet achieved full translation into clinical practice as a consequence of several challenges. The use of additive manufacturing techniques for bone biofabrication is seen as a potential solution, with its inherent capability for reproducibility, accuracy and customisation of scaffolds as well as cell and signalling factor delivery. This review highlights the current research in bone biofabrication, the necessary factors for successful bone biofabrication, in addition to the current limitations affecting biofabrication, some of which are a consequence of the limitations of the additive manufacturing technology itself. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Angiogenesis; Biofabrication; Bone tissue engineering; Osteogenesis; Skeletal stem cell; Tissue regeneration","Bone and Bones; Bone Regeneration; Humans; Tissue Engineering; 3D printers; Bone; Cell engineering; Cell signaling; Industrial research; Manufacture; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Tissue; Tissue engineering; fibrinogen; macrogol; Additive manufacturing technology; Angiogenesis; Biofabrication; Bone tissue engineering; Clinical practices; Current limitation; Manufacturing techniques; Osteogenesis; biomimetics; cell differentiation; cell encapsulation; cell maturation; cell ultrastructure; controlled study; gene expression; geometry; heart development; heart muscle cell; human; human cell; human tissue; hydrogel; microenvironment; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; reproducibility; Review; tissue engineering; tissue growth; bone; bone regeneration; physiology; procedures; Tissue regeneration","","fibrinogen, 9001-32-5; macrogol, 25322-68-3","","","Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (MOHW 104-TDU-M-112-000003); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (318553); Medical Research Council, MRC, (G0802397, G1000842, MK/KO26682/1); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BB/L00609X/1, BB/L021072/1, BB/L026384/1); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (103-2218-E-038-002, MOST 103-2314-B-038-038, MOST 103-2911-I-038-503)","Funding text 1: Work in the authors' laboratories was supported by grants from the BBSRC ( BB/L021072/1 and BB/L00609X/1 , and BBSRC-Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan), MRC ( G1000842 and G0802397 ) and MK/KO26682/1, EU FP7 (FP7/2007–2013 under grant agreement no.

However, a circular economy requires a transformation of both production and consumption systems; the standard approach for creation, fabrication, and commerce of products is challenged. Authors repeatedly call for the development of new proficiencies to attend to system transformations, but these so far have not been described for design and engineering. Given that the design of a product directly influences the way a value chain will be managed, building circular, globally sustainable value chains inevitably signifies a fundamental change in the practice of design. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on case studies from a variety of multinational enterprises that are transforming their product strategies for climate change. Changes in design processes were identified, revealing a growing necessity for industry to employ new proficiencies that support closure of material loops. This paper contributes to existing literature by depicting successful practices being implemented in industry. A variety of new capabilities are key to design for a sustainable future; these range from deeper knowledge of material composition to rich understanding of social behaviour. Resulting from this research, learning goals are proposed to serve as guidance for manufacturing companies seeking to tackle climate change. Conclusions aim to encourage researchers and academics to respond to emerging needs by re-thinking education in design and engineering. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Closed loop systems; Design for lifecycle; Sustainable product-service system (SPSS); Sustainable strategy","Chains; Climate change; Closed loop systems; Design; Engineering education; Industrial research; Life cycle; Manufacture; Product design; Circular economy; Comprehensive analysis; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing industries; Multinational enterprise; Production and consumption; Sustainable products; Sustainable strategies; Industrial economics","","","","","","","Abdul-Rashid S.H., Evans S., Longhurst P., A comparison of four sustainable manufacturing strategies, Int.

Many companies are engaged in assessing ways in which their productivity, product quality, and operations can be improved. A relatively new area of such improvements is business process management (BPM). BPM can be any structured approach used to analyze and continually improve fundamental activities, such as manufacturing, marketing, communications, and other major elements of a company's operation. This paper describes a generic step-by-step method for BPM which encompasses methods employed in industry from incremental improvements to reengineering. To better understand BPM, we have conducted a survey of major US companies on their approaches to process quality assessment. This report summarizes the findings of our survey and our work with a number of leading companies, and may be useful to quality managers and others involved in total quality management, continuous improvement, or reengineering efforts. From these activities, it is apparent that there is wide interest in BPM across all industries. However, the specific approach for implementation of BPM varies from company to company. That notwithstanding, there is a great deal of commonality among the specific approaches which this paper captures and unifies. Due to this interest in BPM, a number of methods and tools, including software, have been used or developed to aid in its implementation. We relate some of these methods and tools to the individual steps of the generic BPM method. © 1995 IEEE","activity-based costing; analytic hierarchy process; business process management; continuous improvement; critical success factors; reengineering; structural analysis; Total quality management","Competition; Cost accounting; Hierarchical systems; Industrial engineering; Quality assurance; Systems analysis; Activity based costing; Analytic hierarchy process; Business process management; Continuous improvement; Critical success factors; Reengineering; Total quality management","","","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","Manuscript received January 7, 1993.

The analysis and data span a wide range of processes from ""conventional"" processes such as machining, casting, and injection molding, to the so-called ""advanced machining"" processes such as electrical discharge machining and abrasive waterjet machining, and to the vapor-phase processes used in semiconductor and nanomaterials fabrication. In all, 20 processes are analyzed. The results show that the intensity of materials and energy used per unit of mass of material processed (measured either as specific energy or exergy) has increased by at least 6 orders of magnitude over the past several decades. The increase of material/energy intensity use has been primarily a consequence of the introduction of new manufacturing processes, rather than changes in traditional technologies. This phenomenon has been driven by the desire for precise small-scale devices and product features and enabled by stable and declining material and energy prices over this period. We illustrate the relevance of thermodynamics (including exergy analysis) for all processes in spite of the fact that long-lasting focus in manufacturing has been on product qualitysnot necessarily energy/material conversion efficiency. We promote the use of thermodynamics tools for analysis of manufacturing processes within the context of rapidly increasing relevance of sustainable human enterprises. We confirm that exergy analysis can be used to identify where resources are lost in these processes, which is the first step in proposing and/or redesigning new more efficient processes. © 2009 American Chemical Society.","","Electricity; Industry; Manufactured Materials; Oxides; Thermodynamics; Volatilization; Conversion efficiency; Electric discharges; Energy resources; Exergy; Industrial engineering; Machining; Nanostructured materials; Production engineering; Thermoanalysis; Thermodynamics; Water craft; Water vapor; Abrasive water jets; Efficient process; Electrical discharge machining; Energy prices; Exergy analysis; Long lastings; Manufacturing process; Nanomaterials fabrications; Orders of magnitudes; Per units; Product features; Specific energies; Thermo dynamic analysis; Thermodynamic frameworks; Vapor-phase; energy market; energy use; exergy; manufacturing; thermodynamics; article; energy consumption; mathematical computing; nanofabrication; semiconductor; thermodynamics; Manufacture","","Oxides, ","","","","","Gyftopoulos E.P., Beretta G.P., Thermodynamics: Foundations and Applications, (2005); Bejan A., Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics, (2006); de Swaan Aarons J., van der Kooi H., Shankaranarayanan K., Efficiency and Sustainability in the Energy and Chemical Industries, (2004); Sato N., Chemical Energy and Exergys-An Introduction to Chemical Thermodynamics for Engineers, (2004); Szargut J., Morris D.R., Steward F.R., Exergy Analysis of Thermal Chemical and Metallurgical Processes, (1988); Williams E.D., Ayres R.U., Heller M., The 1.7 kilogram microchip: Energy and material use in the production of semiconductor devices, Environ.

The wide applicability and low barriers for development of these algorithms are allowing for innovations, once thought unattainable, to be realized in an ever more digital world. As these innovations continue across industries, the manufacturing industry has also begun to gain benefits. With the current push for Smart Manufacturing and Industrie 4.0, ML for manufacturing is experiencing unprecedented levels of interest; but how much is industry actually using these highly-publicized techniques? This paper sorts through a decade of manufacturing publications to quantify the amount of effort being put towards advancing ML in manufacturing. This work identifies both prominent areas of ML use, and popular algorithms. This also allows us to highlight any gaps, or areas where ML could play a vital role. To maximize the search space utilization of this investigation, ML based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to rapidly sort through a vast corpus of engineering documents to identify key areas of research and application, as well as uncover documents most pertinent to this survey. The salient outcome of this research is the presentation of current focus areas and gaps in ML applications to the manufacturing industry, with particular emphasis on cross domain knowledge utilization.

In fact, the introduction of such technologies allows companies to find solutions capable to turn increasing complexity into opportunities for ensuring sustainable competitiveness and profitable growth. Nonetheless, the effective implementation in manufacturing still depends on the state of practice: it may slow down, or even worst, may prevent from implementation. Indeed, we assume that a minimum level of capabilities is required before implementing the digital technologies in a company. Based on this concern, our research question is “are manufacturing companies ready to go digital?”. This paper wants to illustrate a “tool” to answer this question by building a maturity assessment method to measure the digital readiness of manufacturing firms. Based on the inspiring principles of the CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) framework, we propose a model to set the ground for the investigation of company digital maturity. Different dimensions are used to assess 5 areas in which manufacturing key processes can be grouped: (1) design and engineering, (2) production management, (3) quality management, (4) maintenance management and (5) logistics management. Thus, the maturity model provides a normative description of practices in each area and dimension, building a ranked order of practices (i.e. from low to high maturity). A scoring method for maturity assessment is subsequently defined, in order to identify the criticalities in implementing the digital transformation and to subsequently drive the improvement of the whole system. The method should be useful both to manufacturing companies and researchers interested in understanding the digital readiness level in the state of practice. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.","Digital readiness; Digital transformation; Industry 4.0; Maturity model","Industrial management; Manufacture; Quality management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Digital readiness; Digital transformation; Maintenance management; Manufacturing companies; Maturity assessments; Maturity model; Production management; Industrial research","","","","","","","Gmis P., Industry 4.0: Building the Digital Industrial Enterprise, (2016); Lee J., Bagheri B., Jin C., Introduction to cyber manufacturing, Manuf.

In the span of 12 years, extensive efforts have been devoted to the scientific and technological solutions to its inherent drawbacks, including electrically isolated nature of S and Li2S, severe shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and large volume change from S to Li2S upon lithiation. Moreover, the latest research realm of sulfur cathode is frequently emphasized towards its validity in practical applications. In this review, we focus exclusively on a research roadmap of 12 years in sulfur cathode development. We begin with a retrospect of the major conceptions and breakthroughs in different aspects to advance sulfur cathode. Additionally, we detail the major contributions from various countries, institutions, corresponding authors, journals and patents. Herein, we hope to give a comprehensively evolutionary story of sulfur cathode and new insight into the future direction of sulfur cathode, namely, carbon architecture design of sulfur host, advanced characterization techniques for in-depth mechanism understanding and full-cell evaluation for a truly viable LSB. We believe more researches into sulfur cathode should be warranted to understand relevant material chemistries, interfaces and engineering present in the LSBs, consequently bringing in numerous opportunities for battery scientists. © 2020","Bibliometric analysis; Lithium sulfur battery; Sulfur cathode","Cathodes; Industrial research; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Manufacture; Architecture designs; Characterization techniques; Manufacturing cost; Material chemistry; Research interests; Research roadmap; Technological solution; Theoretical capacity; Lithium sulfur batteries","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11904317, 21902144, 51722210, 51972285, U1802254); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LD18E020003, LY17E020010)","The authors acknowledge financial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51722210 , 51972285 , U1802254 , 11904317 , and 21902144 ), and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant no.

Containing illustrative guides that include worked problems, numerical examples, homework problems, a solutions manual, and class-tested materials, it demonstrates to product development and manufacturing professionals how to distribute key reliability practices throughout an organization. The authors explain how to integrate reliability methods and techniques in the Six Sigma process and Design for Six Sigma (DFSS). They also discuss relationships between warranty and reliability, as well as legal and liability issues. Other topics covered include: Reliability engineering in the 21st Century, Probability life distributions for reliability analysis, Process control and process capability, Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis, Health monitoring and prognostics, Reliability tests and reliability estimation, Reliability Engineering provides a comprehensive list of references on the topics covered in each chapter. It is an invaluable resource for those interested in gaining fundamental knowledge of the practical aspects of reliability in design, manufacturing, and testing. In addition, it is useful for implementation and management of reliability programs. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The objective is to minimize the total joint annual costs incurred by the vendor and the buyer. The production process is assumed to deteriorate during processing and produces a certain number of defective items. For practical purpose, the article is concerned with the policy in which the delivery quantity to the buyer is identical at each replenishment. The expected annual integrated total cost function is derived and a solution procedure is established to find out the optimal solution.

During the process, a high intensity laser beam selectively scans a powder bed according to the computer-aided design data of the part to be produced and the powder metal particles are completely molten. The process is capable of producing near full density (∼98-99 per cent relative density) and functional metallic parts with a high geometrical freedom. However, insufficient surface quality of produced parts is one of the important limitations of the process. The purpose of this study is to apply laser re-melting using a continuous wave laser during SLM production of 316L stainless steel and Ti6Al4V parts to overcome this limitation. After each layer is fully molten, the same slice data are used to re-expose the layer for laser re-melting. In this manner, laser re-melting does not only improve the surface quality on the top surfaces, but also has the potential to change the microstructure and to improve the obtained density. The influence of laser re-melting on the surface quality, density and microstructure is studied varying the operating parameters for re-melting such as scan speed, laser power and scan spacing. It is concluded that laser re-melting is a promising method to enhance the density and surface quality of SLM parts at a cost of longer production times. Laser re-melting improves the density to almost 100 per cent whereas 90 per cent enhancement is achieved in the surface quality of SLM parts after laser re-melting. The microhardness is improved in the laser re-molten zone if sufficiently high-energy densities are provided, probably due to a fine-cell size encountered in the microstructure. There has been extensive research in the field of laser surface modification techniques, e.g. laser polishing, laser hardening and laser surface melting, applied to bulk materials produced by conventional manufacturing processes. However, those studies only relate to laser enhancement of surface or sub-surface properties of parts produced using bulk material. They do not aim at enhancement of core material properties, nor surface enhancement of (rough) surfaces produced in a PM way by SLM.

However, this growth has mainly been process-driven. The evolution of engineering design to take advantage of the possibilities afforded by AM and to manage the constraints associated with the technology has lagged behind. This paper presents the major opportunities, constraints, and economic considerations for Design for Additive Manufacturing. It explores issues related to design and redesign for direct and indirect AM production. It also highlights key industrial applications, outlines future challenges, and identifies promising directions for research and the exploitation of AM's full potential in industry. © 2016 CIRP","Additive Manufacturing; Design; Manufacturing","3D printers; Design; Industrial research; Manufacture; Economic considerations; Engineering design; Future challenges; Process-driven; Design for manufacturability","","","","","","","3D Systems and Rita Leibinger Medical Get Disabled Dogs Back on their Feet Fast, (2015); 3D Systems’ ZPrinter Changes the Face of Stop-Motion Animation, (2015); Design Guide – Brass Inserts for SLS Parts, (2015); ProJet<sup>®</sup> 3510 CPX 3D Printer a Gem to Uptown Diamond & Jewelry, (2015); SLS<sup>®</sup> Plastics Design Guide, (2015); AM Reduces Production Steps, Lead Time and Cost, (2015); Superior Fixation for Implant Using AM, (2015); Titanium Mandibular Implant for QMC Patient, (2015); Abbaszadeh F., Rahmati S., Farahmand F., Fatollahzadeh R., Novel Methodology in Design of Custom-Made Hip Prosthesis.

The TOU rate gives consumers opportunities to manage their electricity bill by shifting use from on-peak periods to mid-peak and off-peak periods. Reducing the amount of electricity needed during the peak load times makes it possible for the power grid to meet consumers' needs without building more costly backup infrastructures and help reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions. Previous research on the applications of TOU and other electricity demand response programs has been mainly focused on residential and commercial buildings while largely neglected industrial manufacturing systems. This paper proposes a systems approach for TOU based electricity demand response for sustainable manufacturing systems under the production target constraint. Key features of this approach include: (i) the electricity related costs including both consumption and demand are integrated into production system modeling; (ii) energy-efficient and demand-responsive production scheduling problems are formulated and the solution technique is provided; and (iii) the effects of various factors on the near-optimal scheduling solutions are examined. The research outcome is expected to enhance the energy efficiency, electricity demand responsiveness, and cost effectiveness of modern manufacturing systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost effectiveness; Electricity demand response; Energy efficiency; Load management; Sustainable manufacturing systems","Application programs; Cost effectiveness; Electric load management; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Manufacture; Office buildings; Production control; Production engineering; Commercial building; Electricity demand response; Electricity demands; Industrial manufacturing; Production scheduling problems; Production targets; Solution techniques; Sustainable manufacturing; cost-benefit analysis; demand-side management; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy policy; greenhouse gas; manufacturing; sustainable development; Electricity","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Engineering, ENG, (1131537)","This work is partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1131537 .

More recently, environmental concerns required that disassembly and recycling issues should be considered during the design stages. The effort to reduce total life-cycle costs for a product through design innovation is becoming an essential part of the current manufacturing industry. Therefore, researchers begin to focus their attention on design for environment, design for recyclability, design for life-cycle (DFLC), etc. These studies are sometimes referred to as Design for X (DFX). Since the late 1990s, hundreds of papers have been published pertaining to DFX applications in manufacturing. Most of them are widely distributed over many different disciplines and publications. This makes it very difficult for one to locate all the information necessary for the application of DFX in manufacturing. A paper that can help researchers and practitioners applying this emerging technology is highly desirable. The objective of this paper is to present the concepts, applications, and perspectives of 'DFX' in manufacturing, thus providing some guidelines and references for future research and implementation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

CHO cells are capable of producing high quality biologics exhibiting human-like post-translational modifications in gram quantities. However, production processes for biopharmaceuticals using mammalian cells still suffer from cellular limitations such as limited growth, low productivity and stress resistance as well as higher expenses compared to bacterial or yeast based expression systems. Besides bioprocess, media and vector optimizations, advances in host cell engineering technologies comprising introduction, knock-out or post-transcriptional silencing of engineering genes have paved the way for remarkable achievements in CHO cell line development. Furthermore, thorough analysis of cellular pathways and mechanisms important for bioprocessing steadily unravels novel target molecules which might be addressed by functional genomic tools in order to establish superior production cell factories. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the most fundamental achievements in CHO cell engineering over the past three decades. Finally, the authors discuss the potential of novel and innovative methodologies that might contribute to further enhancement of existing CHO based production platforms for biopharmaceutical manufacturing in the future. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Biopharmaceuticals; Cell engineering; Chinese hamster ovary (CHO); CRISPR; Gene knockout; Genome editing; MicroRNA; SiRNA; TALEN; ZFN","Animals; Cell Engineering; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Humans; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Recombinant Proteins; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cricetulus griseus; Mammalia; Cell culture; Mammals; Manufacture; Molecules; Recombinant proteins; Transcription; Cells; Cytology; Genes; Multiobjective optimization; Production platforms; recombinant protein; Biopharmaceuticals; Chinese hamster ovary; CRISPR; Gene knockout; MicroRNAs; SiRNA; TALEN; bacterium; cells and cell components; drug; future prospect; gene expression; genetic engineering; host; mammal; manufacturing; protein; recombination; yeast; animal; biosynthesis; cell engineering; CHO cell line; Cricetulus; cytology; genetics; hamster; human; metabolism; protein processing; trends; Cell engineering","","Recombinant Proteins, ","","","Ministry for Science, Research and Arts of the federal state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg","This work was supported by the Cooperative Research Training Group Pharmaceutical Biotechnology stated by the Postgraduate Scholarships Act of the Ministry for Science, Research and Arts of the federal state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.

Green roofs are built with different layers and variable thicknesses depending on the roof type and/or weather conditions. Basic layers, from bottom to top, of green roof systems usually consists of a root barrier, drainage, filter, growing medium, and vegetation layer. There are many environmental and operational benefits of vegetated roofs. New technology enabled the use of low density polyethylene and polypropylene (polymers) materials with reduced weight on green roofs. This paper evaluates the environmental benefits of green roofs by comparing emissions of NO2, SO2, O3 and PM10 in green roof material manufacturing process, such as polymers, with the green roof's pollution removal capacity. The analysis demonstrated that green roofs are sustainable products in long-term basis. In general, air pollution due to the polymer production process can be balanced by green roofs in 13-32 years. However, the manufacturing process of low density polyethylene and polypropylene has many other negative impacts to the environment than air pollution. It was evident that the current green roof materials needed to be replaced by more environmentally friendly and sustainable products. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Green roof materials; Green roofs; Polymers; Sustainability","Air quality; Industrial engineering; Life cycle; Manufacture; Materials; Pollution; Polyethylenes; Polymers; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Ternary systems; Thermoplastics; Environmental benefits; Environmentally-friendly; Green roof; Life cycle analysis; Manufacturing process; Negative impacts; Operational benefits; Pollution removal; Polymer production; Sustainable products; Vegetated roof; Weather conditions; atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; polymer; roof; sustainability; Roofs","","","","","","","Acks K., A framework of cost-benefit analysis of green roofs: initial estimates, (2005); Berghage R., Jarrett A., Beattie D., Kelley K., Husain S., Rezai F., Et al., Quantifying evaporation and transpirational water losses from green roofs and green roof media capacity for neutralizing acid rain, (2007); Cavanaugh L.M., Redefining the green roof, J Architectural Eng, 14, 1, pp. 4-6, (2008); Chung C.I., Extrusion of polymers: Theory and practice, (2000); Clark C., Adriaens P., Talbot F.B., Green roof valuation: a probabilistic economic analysis of environmental benefits, Environ Sci Technol, 42, 6, pp. 2155-2161, (2008); Currie B.A., Bass B., Estimate of air pollution mitigation with green plants and green roofs using the UFORE model, Proceedings of third annual greening rooftops for sustainable Communities Conference, (2005); Currie B., Bass B., Using green roofs to enhance biodiversity in the city of Toronto, (2010); Czemiel Berndtsson J., Green roof performance towards management of runoff water quantity and quality: a review, Ecol Eng, 36, 4, pp. 351-360, (2010); Dunnett N., Nagase A., Booth R., Grime P., Influence of vegetation composition on runoff in two simulated green roof experiments, Urban Ecosyst, 11, pp. 385-398, (2008); Getter K.L., Rowe D.B., The role of extensive green roofs in sustainable development, Hort Sci, 41, 5, pp. 1276-1285, (2006); Getter K.L., Rowe D.B., Andresen J.A., Quantifying the effect of slope on extensive green roof stormwater retention, Ecol Eng, 31, 4, pp. 225-231, (2007); Getter K.L., Rowe D.B., Robertson G.P., Cregg B.M., Andresen J.A., Carbon sequestration potential of extensive green roofs, Environ Sci Technol, 43, 19, pp. 7564-7570, (2009); Giles H., Wagner J., Mount E., Extrusion: the definitive processing guide and handbook, (2005); Gray K.A., Finster M.E., The urban heat island, Photochemical Smog, and Chicago: Local Features and the problem and solution, (2000); Jim C.Y., Tsang S.W., Biophysical properties and thermal performance of an intensive green roof, Build Environ, 46, 6, pp. 1263-1274, (2011); Kosareo L., Ries R., Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of green roofs, Build Environ, 42, 7, pp. 2606-2613, (2006); Mayer H., Air pollution in cities, Atmos Environ, 33, pp. 4029-4037, (1999); Mendez C.B., Klenzendorf J.B., Afshar B.R., Simmons M.T., Barrett M.E., Kinney K.A., Kirisits M.J., The effect of roofing material on the quality of harvested rainwater, Water Research, 5, 5, pp. 2049-2059, (2011); Mentens J., Raes D., Hermy M., Green roofs as a tool for solving the rainwater runoff problem in the urbanized 21st century?, Landscape Urban Plan, 77, 3, pp. 217-226, (2006); Molineux C.J., Fentiman C.H., Gange A.C., Characterising alternative recycled waste materials for use as green roof growing media in the U.K, Ecol Eng, 35, 10, pp. 1507-1513, (2009); Nelms C.E., Russell A.D., Lence B.J., Assessing the performance of sustainable technologies: a framework and its application, Build Res Inf, 35, 3, pp. 237-251, (2007); Newsham G.R., Mancini S., Birt B.J., Do LEED-certified buildings save energy?

Both the development of feedstock (especially through cryo-milling, and processes able to manufacture coatings structured at the sub-micrometre or nanometre sizes, such as micrometre-sized agglomerates made of nanometre-sized particles for feedstock) and the emergence of thermal spray processes such as suspension and liquid precursor thermal spray techniques have been driven by the need to manufacture coatings with enhanced properties. These techniques result in two different types of coatings: on the one hand, those with a so-called bimodal structure having nanometre-sized zones embedded within micrometre ones, for which the spray process is similar to that of conventional coatings and on the other hand, sub-micrometre or nanostructured coatings achieved by suspension or solution spraying. Compared with suspension spraying, solution precursor spraying uses molecularly mixed precursors as liquids, avoiding a separate processing route for the preparation of powders and enabling the synthesis of a wide range of oxide powders and coatings. Such coatings are intended for use in various applications ranging from improved thermal barrier layers and wear-resistant surfaces to thin solid electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cell systems, among other numerous applications. Meanwhile these processes are more complex to operate since they are more sensitive to parameter variations compared with conventional thermal spray processes. Progress in this area has resulted from the unique combination of modelling activities, the evolution of diagnostic tools and strategies, and experimental advances that have enabled the development of a wide range of coating structures exhibiting in numerous cases unique properties. Several examples are detailed. In this paper the following aspects are presented successively (i) the two spray techniques used for manufacturing such coatings: thermal plasma and HVOF, (ii) sensors developed for in-flight diagnostics of micrometre-sized particles and the interaction of a liquid and hot gas flow, (iii) three spray processes: conventional spraying using micrometre-sized agglomerates of nanometre-sized particles, suspension spraying and solution spraying and (iv) the emerging issues resulting from the specific structures of these materials, particularly the characterization of these coatings and (v) the potential industrial applications. Further advances require the scientific and industrial communities to undertake new research and development activities to address, understand and control the complex mechanisms occurring, in particular, thermal flow-liquid drops or stream interactions when considering suspension and liquid precursor thermal spray techniques. Work is still needed to develop new measurement devices to diagnose in-flight droplets or particles below 2μm average diameter and to validate that the assumptions made for liquid-hot gas interactions. Efforts are also required to further develop some of the characterization protocols suitable to address the specificities of such nanostructured coatings, as some existing 'conventional' protocols usually implemented on thermal spray coatings are not suitable anymore, in particular to address the void network architectures from which numerous coatings properties are derived. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Agglomeration; Feedstocks; Fuel cells; Industrial applications; Ion beams; Liquids; Manufacture; Network architecture; Powders; Research and development management; Solid electrolytes; Spray guns; Sprayed coatings; Suspensions (fluids); Thermal barrier coatings; Thermal spraying; Alumina coating; Average diameter; Bimodal structures; Coating structures; Complex mechanisms; Conventional coatings; Diagnostic tools; Feedstock particles; Hot gas; Hot gas flow; Industrial communities; Liquid drop; Liquid precursors; Measurement device; Micrometre-sized particles; Mixed precursors; Nanometres; Nanostructured coatings; Nanostructured particles; Oxide powder; Parameter variation; Processing Route; Research and development; Size ranges; Solid oxide; Solution precursor; Spray process; Spray technique; Sprayed particles; Thermal barrier; Thermal flows; Thermal plasma; Thermal spray; Thermal spray coatings; Thermal spray process; Thermal spray techniques; Wear-resistant; HVOF thermal spraying","","","","","","","Ashby M.F., Ferreira P.J., Schodek D.L., Nanomaterials Properties Nanomaterials, Nanotechnologies and Design, pp. 199-255, (2009); Rosas R.A., Riera R., Marin J.L., Campoy G., Electro-optical and transport properties of quasi-two-dimensional nanostructured materials, Handbook of Thin Films, pp. 207-335, (2002); Zhang Z.M., Fu C.J., Zhu Q.Z., Optical and thermal radiative properties of semiconductors related to micro/nanotechnology, Adv.

Since it is practically impossible to model, copy, or control the IC manufacturing process variations, PUFs not only make these chips unique, but also effectively unclonable. Exploiting the inherent variations in the IC manufacturing process, PUFs provide a secure, robust, low cost mechanism to authenticate silicon chips. This makes PUFs attractive for RFID ICs where cost and security are the key requirements. In this paper we present the design and implementation of PUF enabled ""unclonable"" RFIDs. The PUF-enabled RFID has been fabricated in 0.18μ technology, and extensive testing results demonstrate that PUFs can securely authenticate an RFID with minimal overheads. We also highlight the advantages of PUF based RFIDs in anti-counterfeiting and security applications. © 2008 IEEE.","","Industrial engineering; Optical design; Production engineering; Silicon; Anti-counterfeiting; Extensive testing; Frequency identification; IC manufacturing; International conferences; Low costs; Physical characteristics; Physical Unclonable Functions; Security applications; Silicon chips; Nonmetals","","","","","","","Bolotnyy L., Robins G., Physically Unclonable Function -Based Security and Privacy in RFID Systems, Proc.

Based on the industrial robot data provided by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the panel data of China's 14 manufacturing sectors from 2008 to 2017, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of AI on technological innovation. Our analysis shows that the mechanism of how AI affects technological innovation is that the former promotes technological innovation through accelerating knowledge creation and technology spillover, improving learning and absorptive capacities, while increasing R&D and talent investment. Our empirical results indicate that under the condition of controlling intensity of R&D investment, FDI, ownership structure, technical imitation, AI significantly promotes technological innovation. And the impact of AI on technological innovation experiences sector heterogeneity: AI has more significant impact on the technological innovation of low-tech sectors. The higher the level of AI, the greater its impact on technological innovation. Based on our established conclusions, we provide corresponding suggestions and recommendations for managerial decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","artificial intelligence; sector heterogeneity; technological innovation","China; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Manufacture; Absorptive capacity; International Federation of Robotics; Knowledge creations; Managerial decision making; Manufacturing sector; Ownership structure; Technological innovation; Technology spillovers; artificial intelligence; industrial technology; innovation; manufacturing; panel data; research and development; spillover effect; Engineering education","","","","","Humanities and Social Sciences Research Planning Foundation of China's Ministry of Education, (19YJA790055); Social Science Foundation Major Project of Jiangsu, China, (18ZD003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71973068); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (16EYB012)","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71973068 ), Social Science Foundation Major Project of Jiangsu, China (Grant No. 18ZD003 ), Humanities and Social Sciences Research Planning Foundation of China's Ministry of Education (Grant No. 19YJA790055 ) and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu , China (Grant No. 16EYB012 ).","Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work, NBER Working Paper, (2018); Aghion P., Jones B.F., Jones C.I., Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth, NBER Working Paper, (2017); Agrawal A.K., Gans J.S., Goldfarb A., Prediction, judgment and complexity: a theory of decision making and artificial intelligence, NBER Working Paper, (2018); Amit K.S., Manvendra J., Ajith A., Pranab K., Muhuri, engineering applications of artificial intelligence: a bibliometric analysis of 30 years (1988-2018), Eng.

However, there are many unavoidable uncertainties (noise factors) in the industrial manufacturing process, such as material characteristics and manufacturing precision. These will result in big fluctuations for the product's reliability and quality in mass production, which are not investigated in the deterministic approach. Therefore, a robust approach based on the technique of design for six sigma is presented for the system-level design optimization of drive systems to improve the reliability and quality of products in batch production in this work. Meanwhile, two system-level optimization frameworks are presented for the proposed method, namely, single-level (only at the system level) and multilevel frameworks. Finally, a drive system is investigated as an example, and detailed results are presented and discussed. It can be found that the reliability and quality levels of the investigated drive system have been greatly increased by using the proposed robust approach. © 2015 IEEE.","Design for six sigma (DFSS); electrical drive systems; model predictive control (MPC); robust design; system-level design optimization; transverse flux machine (TFM)","Design; Electric machine control; Manufacture; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Reliability; Work simplification; Design for Six Sigma; Electrical drive systems; Robust designs; System level design; Transverse flux machines; Product design","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP120104305)","","Zhu Z.Q., Howe D., Electrical machines and drives for electric, hybrid, fuel cell vehicles, Proc.

The unique manufacturing process of SLM offers a competitive advantage in case of very complex and highly customized parts having quasi-static mechanical properties comparable to those of wrought materials. However, it is not currently being harnessed in dynamic applications due to the lack of reliable fatigue data. The manufacturing process shows competitive advantages particularly in the aerospace and medical industry in which Ti-6Al-4V is commonly used, especially for high performance and dynamic applications. Therefore, in this exploratory research, high cycle fatigue (HCF) tests were performed for as-built, polished and shot-peened samples to investigate the capability of SLM for these applications. As-built samples showed a drastic decrement of fatigue limit due to poor surface quality (Ra≈ 13 μm) obtained from the SLM process. Polishing improved the fatigue limit to more than 500 MPa, the typical value for base material. The effect of shot-peening proved to be antithetical to the expected results. In this context, fractographic analysis showed that very small remnant porosity (less than 0.4%) played a critical role in fatigue performance. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Crackinitiation; Fatigue limit; High cycle fatigue (HCF); Selective laser melting (SLM); Ti-6Al-4V; Titanium alloy","Aluminum; Competition; Crack initiation; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Mechanical properties; Production engineering; Additive Manufacturing; Competitive advantage; Fatigue Limit; Fractographic analysis; High cycle fatigue; Manufacturing process; Selective laser melting; Ti-6al-4v; Titanium alloys","","","","","","","Thomas D., The Development of Design Rules For Selective Laser Melting, (2010); Bo Q., Fei H., Yu-Sheng S., Qing-Song W., Comparison of two scan strategies applied to selective laser melting, International Conference On Computer Application and SystemModeling, pp. 685-689, (2010); Santos E., Abe F., Kitamura Y., Osakada K., Shiomi M., Microstructure and mechanical properties of pure titanium models fabricated by selectivelaser melting, Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science, 218, pp. 711-719, (2004); Kruth J.P., Bodrossamay M., Yasa E., Deckers J., Thijs L., Van Hmbeeck J., Part and material properties in selective laser melting of metals, 16th InternationalSymposium On Electromachining, (2010); Wycisk E., Kranz J., Emmelmann C., Fatigue strength of light weight structures produced by laser additive manufacturing in TiAl6V4, Proceedings of 1st International Conference of the International Journal of Structural Integrity, Porto, (2012); Casavola C., Campanelli S.L., Pappaletteri C., Experimental Analysis of Residual Stresses In the Selective Laser Melting Process, (2008); Mercelis P., Kruth J.-P., Residual stresses in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 12, pp. 254-265, (2006); Wagner L., Luetjering G., Influence of shot peening on the fatigue behavior of titanium alloys, First International Conference On Shot Peening, pp. 453-460, (1981)","","","","University of Tabriz, Iran; Cambridge Institute of Technology, India","4th International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Technology, ICMST 2013","3 August 2013 through 4 August 2013","Dubai","100393","10226680","978-303785867-7","","","English","Adv.

These generators are both grid-connected and stand-alone applications. We present an overview of the essential research results. The paper concentrates on the operation and modeling of stand-alone power systems with PV power generators. Systems with PV array-inverter assemblies, operating in the slave-and-master modes, are discussed, and the simulation results obtained using a renewable energy power system modular simulator are presented. These results demonstrate that simulation is an essential step in the system development process and that PV power generators constitute a valuable energy source. They have the ability to balance the energy and supply good power quality. It is demonstrated that when PV array-inverters are operating in the master mode in stand-alone applications, they well perform the task of controlling the voltage and frequency of the power system. The mechanism of switching the master function between the diesel generator and the PV array-inverter assembly in a stand-alone power system is also proposed and analyzed. Finally, some experimental results on a practical system are compared to the simulation results and confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach to the development of renewable energy systems with PV power generators. © 2008 IEEE.","Autonomous power systems; Master/slave inverter operation; Photovoltaic (PV) systems; Power system modeling and simulation","Direct energy conversion; Electric network analysis; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Industrial engineering; Power quality; Power transmission; Renewable energy resources; Solar equipment; Solar power generation; Balance (weighting); Diesel generator (DG); Energy sourcing; Grid-connected; Manufacturing technologies; Operation and modeling; Photovoltaic (PV); Photovoltaic power generators; Power generators; Power systems; Practical systems; PV-power generators; Renewable energy (RE); Renewable energy systems; Research results; Simulation results; Solar panels; Stand alone power systems; Stand-alone applications; System development processes; Solar energy","","","","","","","Carrasco J.M., Franquelo L.G., Bialasiewicz J.T., Galvan E., Portillo R.C., Martin Prats M.A., Leon J.E., Moreno-Alfonso N., Power-electronic systems for the grid integration of renewable energy sources: A survey, IEEE Trans.

The knowledge of the mesoscopic deformed geometry is important for reinforcement permeability computations and for damage prediction analyses of the composite. A simulation method for woven composite fabric deformation at mesoscopic scale is presented in this paper. A specific continuum hypo-elastic constitutive model is proposed for the yarn behavior. The associated objective derivative is based on the fiber rotation. Spherical and deviatoric parts of the transverse behavior are uncoupled. X-ray tomography is used to obtain experimental undeformed and deformed 3D geometries of the textile reinforcements. It provides, in particular, fiber distribution within the yarn. A comparison between deformed geometries obtained by mesoscopic simulation and by tomography is presented for biaxial tension and in-plane shear deformation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the origin, current status and the future developments in manufacturing are disused. Smart manufacturing is an emerging form of production integrating manufacturing assets of today and tomorrow with sensors, computing platforms, communication technology, control, simulation, data intensive modelling and predictive engineering. It utilises the concepts of cyber-physical systems spearheaded by the internet of things, cloud computing, service-oriented computing, artificial intelligence and data science. Once implemented, these concepts and technologies would make smart manufacturing the hallmark of the next industrial revolution. The essence of smart manufacturing is captured in six pillars, manufacturing technology and processes, materials, data, predictive engineering, sustainability and resource sharing and networking. Material handling and supply chains have been an integral part of manufacturing. The anticipated developments in material handling and transportation and their integration with manufacturing driven by sustainability, shared services and service quality and are outlined. The future trends in smart manufacturing are captured in ten conjectures ranging from manufacturing digitisation and material-product-process phenomenon to enterprise dichotomy and standardisation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automated manufacturing systems; cyber-physical systems; data mining; design of production systems; intelligent manufacturing systems; product life cycle; smart manufacturing; sustainable manufacturing; transportation","Cyber Physical System; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Embedded systems; Flow control; Life cycle; Materials handling; Product design; Quality of service; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Transportation; Automated manufacturing systems; Design of production systems; Intelligent manufacturing system; Product life cycles; Smart manufacturing; Sustainable manufacturing; Manufacture","","","","","","","Chun Y., Bidanda B., Sustainable Manufacturing and the Role of the International Journal of Production Research, International Journal of Production Research, 51, 23-24, pp. 7448-7455, (2013); Cotrell J., Stehly T., Johnson J., Roberts J.O., Parker Z., Scott G., Heimiller D., Analysis of Transportation and Logistics Challenges Affecting the Deployment of Larger Wind Turbines: Summary of Results, (2014); Groumpos P.P., The Challenge of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS): The European IMS Information Event, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 6, 1, pp. 67-77, (1995); Helu M., Libes D., Lunell J., Lyons K., Moris K.C., Enabling Smart Manufacturing Technologies for Decision-Making Support, Proceedings of the ASME 2016 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE, pp. 1-10, (2016); Ivanov D., Dolgui A., Sokolov B., Werner F., Ivanova M., A Dynamic Model and an Algorithm for Short-term Supply Chain Scheduling in the Smart Factory Industry 4.0, International Journal of Production Research, 54, 2, pp. 386-402, (2016); Kang H.S., Lee J.Y., Choi S.S., Kim H., Park J.H., Son J.Y., Smart Manufacturing: Past Research, Present Findings, and Future Directions, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing-Green Technology, 3, pp. 111-128, (2016); Kim Y.-H., Chang H.-B., The Industrial Security Management Model for SMBs in Smart Work, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 25, pp. 319-327, (2014); Kusiak A., Editorial, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 1, 1, (1990); Kusiak A., Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, (1990); Kusiak A., Put Innovation Science at the Heart of Discovery, Nature, 530, (2016); Kusiak A., Share Data on Wind Energy, Nature, 529, 7584, pp. 19-21, (2016); Kusiak A., A Four-part Plan for Smart Manufacturing, ISE Magazine, 49, 7, pp. 43-47, (2017); Kusiak A., Smart Manufacturing Must Embrace Big Data, Nature, 544, 7648, pp. 23-25, (2017); Lu Y., Morris K.C., Frechette S., Current Standards Landscape for Smart Manufacturing Systems, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (2016); Macke N., Rulhoff S., Stjepandic J., Advances in Smart Manufacturing Change Management, Transdisciplinary Engineering: Crossing Boundaries, pp. 318-328, (2016); Moon J.-Y., Park J., Smart Production Scheduling with Time-dependent and Machine-dependent Electricity Cost by Considering Distributed Energy Resources and Energy Storage, International Journal of Production Research, 52, 13, pp. 3922-3939, (2014); O'Donovan P., Bruton K., O'Sullivan D.T.J., Case Study: The Implementation of a Data-driven Industrial Analytics Methodology and Platform for Smart Manufacturing, International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management, 7, pp. 1-21, (2016); Shafiq S.I., Sanin C., Toro C., Szczerbicki E., Virtual Engineering Object (VEO): Toward Experience-based Design and Manufacturing for Industry 4.0, Cybernetics and Systems, 46, 1-2, pp. 35-50, (2015); Thoben K.-D., Wiesner S., Wuest T., ‘Industrie 4.0’ and Smart Manufacturing–A Review of Research Issues and Application Examples, International Journal of Automation Technology, 11, 1, pp. 4-16, (2017); Zhang L., Luo Y.-L., Tao F., Li B.-H., Ren L., Zhang X., Cloud Manufacturing: A New Manufacturing Paradigm, Enterprise Information Systems, 8, 2, pp. 167-187, (2014); Zhong R.Y., Xu C., Chen C., Huang G.Q., Big Data Analytics for Physical Internet-based Intelligent Manufacturing Shop Floors, International Journal of Production Research, 55, 9, pp. 2610-2621, (2017)","A.

The XCT technology and AM processes are summarised, and their historical use is documented. The use of XCT and AM as tools for medical reverse engineering is discussed, and the transition of XCT from a tool used solely for imaging to a vital metrological instrument is documented. The current states of the combined technologies are then examined in detail, separated into porosity measurements and general dimensional measurements. In the conclusions of this review, the limitation of resolution on improvement of porosity measurements and the lack of research regarding the measurement of surface texture are identified as the primary barriers to ongoing adoption of XCT in AM. The limitations of both AM and XCT regarding slow speeds and high costs, when compared to other manufacturing and measurement techniques, are also noted as general barriers to continued adoption of XCT and AM. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","additive manufacture; metrology; x-ray computed tomography","Computerized tomography; Manufacture; Measurements; Medical imaging; Porosity; Reverse engineering; Tomography; Additive manufacture; Combined technology; Dimensional measurements; Measurement techniques; Porosity measurement; Surface textures; X-CT technologies; X-ray computed tomography; 3D printers","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I033335/1, EP/I033335/2, EP/L01534X/1, EP/M008983/1)","The authors would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC Grants EP/M008983/1 and EP/L01534X/1) and 3 T RPD Ltd for funding this work.","Dimensional and Geometrical Product Specifications and Verification, (1996); Statistics - Vocabulary and Symbols - Part 2: Statistical Quality Control, (1993); Sun W., Brown S.B., Leach R.K., An Overview of Industrial X-ray Computed Tomography, (2012); Kruth J.-P., Bartscher M., Carmignato S., Schmitt R., De Chiffre L., Weckenmann A., Computed tomography for dimensional metrology, CIRP Ann.

The LENS process can be analyzed as a sequence of discrete events, given that it is a layer-by-layer process. The thermal history associated with the LENS process involves numerous reheating cycles. In this article, the thermal behavior during laser deposition with LENS is simulated numerically by using the alternate-direction explicit (ADE) finite difference method (FDM). The simulation results showed that deposited material experiences a significant rapid quenching effect during the initial stages of deposition and can attain a very high cooling rate. With an increase in deposit thickness, the rapid quenching effect decreases and eventually disappears. The effects of the processing parameters on the thermal behavior of deposited materials were also simulated and analyzed. The objective of this study is to provide insight into the thermal history during the LENS process, where the ability to correlate process parameters to microstructural evolution is a motivating force. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2008.","","Cooling; History; Industrial engineering; Lasers; Lenses; Microstructural evolution; Neutron sources; Numerical analysis; Optical instruments; Quenching; Rapid quenching; Cooling rate; Deposit thickness; Deposited materials; Discrete events; Finite difference method (FDM); Initial stages; Laser depositions; Layer by layers; Manufacturing processes; Micro-structural; Net shaping; Numerical calculations; Process parameters; Processing parameters; Quenching effects; Simulation results; Finite difference method","","","","","NASA Marshall; United States Department of Energy; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMI-0423695)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DMI-0423695 and by NASA Marshall under Contract No. NNM06AB11C.

Main St, United States","Concern over the impact of anthropogenic carbon emissions on the global climate has increased in recent years due to growth in global warming awareness. Approximately 5% of global CO2 emissions originate from the manufacturing of cement, the third largest source of carbon emission in the United States. In addition to the generation of CO2 the cement manufacturing process produces millions of tons of the waste product cement kiln dust (CKD) each year contributing to respiratory and pollution health risks. In this paper LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impact of four cement manufacturing processes: (1) the production of traditional Portland cement, (2) blended cement (natural pozzolans), (3) cement where 100% of waste cement kiln dust is recycled into the kiln process, and (4) Portland cement produced when cement kiln dust (CKD) is used to sequester a portion of the process related CO2 emissions. To reduce uncertainty this manuscript presents a cradle-to-gate life-cycle assessment of several cement products. Analysis using SimaPro 6.0 software shows that blended cements provide the greatest environmental savings followed by utilization of CKD for sequestration. The recycling of CKD was found to have little environmental savings over the traditional process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding servitization through a platform approach is important because many manufacturing firms fail to manage the service paradox, that is, the challenge of simultaneously enriching the value proposition by adding services while maintaining cost levels. This study focuses on how adopting a platform approach leverages the value of digital and information technologies (e.g., smart and connected machines) for advanced service offerings. It is argued that a platform approach based on a modular architecture can enable manufacturers to pursue both customization and operational efficiency. Based on multiple case studies, the findings highlight the importance of information modules replacing product and service modules as the core modules for successful servitization. More specifically, the findings illustrate the journeys of manufacturing firms as they leverage value from information modules to facilitate the orchestrating role of back-end units and the builder role of front-end units. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Digitalization; Information module; Modularity; Platform; Servitization","Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Digitalization; Information module; Modularity; Platform; Servitization; Manufacture","","","","","","","Baines T., Lightfoot H., Made to Serve: How Manufacturers can Compete Through Servitization and Product Service Systems, (2013); Baines T., Lightfoot H.W., Servitization of the manufacturing firm: exploring the operations practices and technologies that deliver advanced services, Int.

Recently these techniques were applied in the area of industrial engineering; the most-known applications include scheduling and sequencing in manufacturing systems, computer-aided design, facility layout and location problems, distribution and transportation problems, and many others. Industrial engineering problems usually are quite hard to solve due to a high complexity of the objective functions and a significant number of problem-specific constraints; often an algorithm to solve such problems requires incorporation of some heuristic methods. In this paper we concentrate on constraint handling heuristics for evolutionary computation techniques. This general discussion is followed by three test case studies: truss structure optimization problem, design of a composite laminated plate, and the unit commitment problem. These are typical highly constrained engineering problems and the methods discussed here are directly transferrable to industrial engineering problems.

The principal characteristics of particles are strongly linked to the manufacturing process. Coatings also depend on the process used to spray particles and spray parameters. Many papers have been devoted to the relationships existing between coating properties and structures at different scales and manufacturing processes. In many conventional spray conditions resulting in micrometric structures, among the different parameters, good powder flow ability, and dense particles are important features. Thermal plasma treatment, especially by RF plasma, of particles, prepared by different manufacturing processes, allows achieving such properties and it is now developed at an industrial scale. Advantages and drawbacks of this process will be discussed. Another point, which will be approached, is the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, depending very strongly upon the starting composite particle manufacturing. However, as everybody knows, ""small is beautiful"" and nano- or finely structured coatings are now extensively studied with spraying of: (i) very complex alloys containing multiple elements which exhibit a glass forming capability when cooled-down, their under-cooling temperature being below the glass transition temperature; (ii) conventional micrometer-sized particles (in the 30-90 μm range) made of agglomerated nanometer-sized particles; (iii) sub-micrometer- or nanometer-sized particles via a suspension in which also, instead of particles, stable sol of nanometer-sized particles can be introduced; and (iv) spray solutions of final material precursor. These different processes using plasma, HVOF or sometimes flame and also cold-gas spray will be discussed together with the production of nanometer-sized particles via the chemical reaction method or by a special type of milling: the cryogenic milling process often referred to as ""cryomilling."" © 2009 ASM International.","Coating; Cold-gas spraying; Feedstock; Manufacturing routes; Nanometer-sized particle; Thermal spray processes","Composite materials; Density (specific gravity); Feedstocks; Glass; Glass transition; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Mechanical properties; Micrometers; Milling (machining); Plasma applications; Production engineering; Spray guns; Suspensions (fluids); Synthesis (chemical); Thermal spraying; Coating microstructures; Coating properties; Cold gas spraying; Complex alloys; Composite particles; Cooling temperature; Cryogenic milling process; Cryomilling; Dense particles; Different process; Different scale; Finely structured coatings; Gas spray; Glass transition temperature; Glass-forming; Industrial scale; Manufacturing process; Mass densities; Mechanical resistance; Micrometer sized particles; Micrometric structures; Multiple elements; Nanometer-sized particle; Nanometer-sized particles; Powder composition; Powder Flow; RF plasma; Self-propagating high temperature synthesis; Spray conditions; Spray parameters; Spray particles; Spray solutions; Submicrometers; Thermal plasma; Thermal spray; Thermal spray process; Thermally sprayed coatings; Thermomechanical properties; Sprayed coatings","","","","","","","Handbook of Powder Technology, 12, pp. 1-1227, (2007); Handbook of Thermal Spray Technology, (2004); Thermal Spraying, Practice, Theory and Application, (1985); Pawlowski L., The Science and Engineering of Thermal Spray Coatings, (1995); Kubel E.J., Powders dictate thermal spray coating properties, Adv.

The properties of natural fibre reinforced polymer composites are generally governed by the pre-treated process of fibre and the manufacturing process of the composites. These properties can be tailored for various types of applications by properly selecting suitable fibres, matrices, additives and production methods. Besides, due to the complexity of fibre structures, different mechanical performances of the composites are obtained even with the use of the same fibre types with different matrices. Some critical issues like poor wettability, poor bonding and degradation at the fibre/matrix interface (a hydrophilic and hydrophobic effect) and damage of the fibre during the manufacturing process are the main causes of the reduction of the composites' strength. In this paper, different manufacturing processes and their suitability for natural fibre composites, based on the materials, mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres and matrices are discussed in detail.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","digital twin; internet of things; machine learning; petrochemical industry; production control optimization","Data mining; E-learning; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning systems; Machine learning; Manufacture; Metadata; Petrochemical plants; Production control; Control optimization; digital twin; Environmental characteristic; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent production control; Machine learning technology; Petrochemical industry; Process manufacturing industries; Petrochemicals","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71421001, 71431002, 71772002, 71872033); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, (20180550433); Liaoning Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (L18CGL015); Jilin Office of Philosophy and Social Science, JLPOPSS","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71772002, 71431002, 71421001, 71872033]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [20180550433]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Fund of Liaoning Province [L18CGL015].; Funding text 2: This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 71772002 , 71431002 , 71421001 , 71872033 ]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [ 20180550433 ]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Fund of Liaoning Province [ L18CGL015 ].

Industry 4.0 is a set of disruptive digital and physical technologies that offer new values and services to customers and organizations. In this study, we propose a model to measure the degree of readiness of a manufacturing organization with regard to the implementation of Industry 4.0. Some models have been proposed in the past to determine the degree of maturity of a company that measures the progress made by the company in the implementation of Industry 4.0. However, no model has yet been proposed that determines the degree of readiness of a company, which is an earlier step in the maturation process. To develop the proposed model in this study, we employ a structure based on the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J4000 standard for measuring the implementation of lean manufacturing in a company; the model is duly modified to encompass Industry 4.0 principles and concepts. The proposed model comprises eight technology enablers that are the most relevant based on existing literatures. The real-world utilization of the proposed model is tested by an auto-parts manufacturing company in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Degree of readiness; Enabling technologies; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Maturity approach","Engineering; Industry; Manufacture; Degree of readiness; Enabling technologies; Industrial sector; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing organizations; Maturity approach; Society of automotive engineers; Structure-based; Industry 4.0","","","","","UNINOVE; Universidade Nove de Julho; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (303661/2016-0)","The authors are grateful to the Research Backing Fund from UNINOVE – Universidade Nove de Julho and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ) grant #303661/2016-0 for providing the financial support needed to develop this work.

It is transforming how we assemble our prototypes and, in the future, manufacture our products. There have been a number of materials that can be utilized for this technology, however, high performance polymer nanocomposites are a very important class of material that is just recently being used in additive manufacturing. High performance polymer is a group of polymer materials that are known to retain its desirable mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when subjected to harsh environment such as high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive chemicals. When mixed with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube, nanoclay, and graphene, these polymers can have improved mechanical properties and sometimes acquire properties that were not present initially like thermal and electrical conductivity. This review article aims to summarize available additive manufacturing techniques, high performance polymers and nanofillers available, and research efforts on its use for additive manufacturing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

PSS offerings based on the manufacturer’s knowledge about the product and the technology can increase its status as problem-solver and solution-provider, reduce life cycle cost and produce high revenue. However, PSS including, e.g. hardware, services, software and electronics are efficient and competitive only if developed for the specific purpose with features such as easy to maintain, upgradeable, with built-in sensors for collecting in-use and service data, and easy to use. This changes the requirements on the manufacturing firm’s development process. Looking back historically, the last century gives an interesting changing landscape of the rationale for the product-development methods used in manufacturing firms. This article, based on the previous research in the product- and service-development fields, and on empirical results from studies at several manufacturing firms, looks into how the engineering work is affected by PSS and how it can be enhanced for PSS, especially in terms of required competencies and other capabilities. It results in recommendations for a new, functional product-development process. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Engineering methods; Functional product development; Integrated solutions; Product service systems","Engineering research; Hardware; Industrial research; Manufacture; Product development; Development process; Engineering methods; Functional product development; Integrated solutions; Product and service development; Product development methods; Product-service systems; Productservice system (PSS); Life cycle","","","","","Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF; VINNOVA","The authors thank all participating companies for their support.

This paper presents a review of the current status and outlook of CFRP recycling operations, focusing on state-of-the-art fibre reclamation and re-manufacturing processes, and on the commercialisation and potential applications of recycled products. It is shown that several recycling and re-manufacturing processes are reaching a mature stage, with implementations at commercial scales in operation, production of recycled CFRPs having competitive structural performances, and demonstrator components having been manufactured. The major challenges for the sound establishment of a CFRP recycling industry and the development of markets for the recyclates are summarised; the potential for introducing recycled CFRPs in structural components is discussed, and likely promising applications are investigated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","","Carbon; Construction Materials; Polymers; Recycling; Waste Products; Carbon fibers; Fiber reinforced plastics; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Polymers; Production engineering; Reinforced plastics; carbon fiber; polymer; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Commercialisation; Current status; Economic factors; Manufacturing process; Potential applications; Recyclates; Recycled products; Recycling industry; Recycling operations; Structural applications; Structural component; Structural performance; Technology review; commercialization; economic impact; environmental factor; polymer; recycling; structural component; article; chemical industry; composite material; cost effectiveness analysis; environmental impact assessment; intermethod comparison; marketing; oxidation kinetics; priority journal; process development; process technology; pyrolysis; recycling; social marketing; structure analysis; Recycling","","Carbon, 7440-44-0; Polymers, ; Waste Products, ; carbon fiber, ","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (SFRH/BD/44051/2008)","The funding from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Project No. SFRH/BD/44051/2008 ) is gratefully acknowledged.

Today, microreactors are realized as miniaturized continuous flow systems or reaction vessels with typical channel or chamber widths in the range of 10-500 μm. The reduction of characteristic dimensions resulting in a small volume of the reaction zone allows an application of high temperature or reactant concentration gradients, as well as a significantly enhanced process control and heat management. Thereby, the unique advantages of microreaction systems are to carry out chemical reactions in unusual process regimes or under isothermal conditions. In addition, microreactors offer the production of toxic or explosive chemicals onsite or ondemand with an inherent safety. Recently, microreactors gain more and more relevance in process development and industrial research. One example for a successful application is the synthesis of a vitamin precursor by a homogeneously catalyzed liquid/ liquid-phase reaction. Some other classes of chemical reactions, e.g. gas phase reactions (formation of ethylene oxide) or two phase systems (gas/liquid), are under investigation.","","Chemical reactors; Electrochemistry; Heat transfer; Industrial research; Manufacture; Process engineering; Product development; Synthesis (chemical); Technology transfer; Ethylene oxide; Heat management; Microreaction technology; Process development; Chemical reactions","","","","","German Ministry of Education, Research and Technology; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (16 SV 671/8)","We would like to thank all partners within the joint project ‘Mikreak’ for cooperation in preparing lists of duties and kinetic data for the ethylene oxide microreactor.

Accordingly, there is a fundamental need for assisting companies in the transition to Industry 4.0 technologies/practices, and guiding them for improving their capabilities in a standardized, objective, and repeatable way. Maturity Models (MMs) aim to assist organizations by providing comprehensive guidance. Therefore, the literature is reviewed systematically with the aim of identifying existing studies related to MMs proposed in the context of Industry 4.0. Seven identified MMs are analyzed by comparing their characteristics of scope, purpose, completeness, clearness, and objectivity. It is concluded that none of them satisfies all expected criteria. In order to satisfy the need for a structured Industry 4.0 assessment/maturity model, SPICE-based Industry 4.0-MM is proposed in this study. Industry 4.0-MM has a holistic approach consisting of the assessment of process transformation, application management, data governance, asset management, and organizational alignment areas. The aim is to create a common base for performing an assessment of the establishment of Industry 4.0 technologies, and to guide companies towards achieving a higher maturity stage in order to maximize the economic benefits of Industry 4.0.

This kind of intelligent system is called a human–cyber–physical system (HCPS). In terms of technology, HCPSs can both reveal technological principles and form the technological architecture for intelligent manufacturing. It can be concluded that the essence of intelligent manufacturing is to design, construct, and apply HCPSs in various cases and at different levels. With advances in information technology, intelligent manufacturing has passed through the stages of digital manufacturing and digital-networked manufacturing, and is evolving toward new-generation intelligent manufacturing (NGIM). NGIM is characterized by the in-depth integration of new-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology (i.e., enabling technology) with advanced manufacturing technology (i.e., root technology); it is the core driving force of the new industrial revolution. In this study, the evolutionary footprint of intelligent manufacturing is reviewed from the perspective of HCPSs, and the implications, characteristics, technical frame, and key technologies of HCPSs for NGIM are then discussed in depth. Finally, an outlook of the major challenges of HCPSs for NGIM is proposed. © 2019 THE AUTHORS","Cyber–physical system; Enabling technology; Human–cyber–physical system; Human–physical system; Knowledge engineering; Manufacturing domain technology; New-generation artificial intelligence; New-generation intelligent manufacturing","Intelligent systems; Knowledge engineering; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Artificial intelligence technologies; Enabling technologies; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent manufacturing system; Manufacturing domains; Physical systems; Technological architectures; Manufacture","","","","","Chinese Academy of Engineering; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program, (20180025); Key Laboratory of Engineering Plastics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, (2017-ZD-08)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a strategic research project from the Chinese Academy of Engineering ( 2017-ZD-08 ) and the International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program ( 20180025 ), to which we would like to express our gratitude. ; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Lu Yongxiang, Li Peigen, Pan Yunhe, Zhu Gaofeng, Wu Cheng, Li Bohu, Liu Baicheng, Wang Tianran, Lu Bingheng, Tan Jianrong, Yang Huayong, Li Dequn, Duan Zhengcheng, Jiang Zhuangde, Lin Zhongqin, Ma Weiming, Ding Rongjun, Gao Jinji, Liu Yongcai, Feng Peide, Chai Tianyou, Sun Youxian, Yuan Qingtang, Qian Feng, Qu Xianming, Shao Xinyu, Dong Jingchen, Chen Jing, Zhu Sendi, Cai Weici, Zhang Gang, Huang Qunhui, Lv Wei, Yu Xiaohui, Ning Zhenbo, Zhao Min, Guo Zhaohui, Li Yizhang, Zhu Duoxian, Theodor Freiheit and other experts for their contributions.

The study at hand will examine companies´ awareness, readiness and capability to meet this challenge taking into account the special role of SMEs Design/methodology/approach: The results of nine studies dealing with this range of topics are examined in the framework of a systematic review and compared with regard to the objective of the study at hand. Findings: The review showed that, as a rule, there is an awareness concerning the relevance of the topic. The readiness and the capability to meet this challenge existin parts; however, they strongly depend on the enterprise size. The smaller SMEs are, the higher the risk that they will become victims instead of beneficiaries of this revolution. Originality/value: Considering different studies concerning Industry 4.0 the article gives an insight into the dependence of the Industry 4.0 readiness in reference to the company size.

This issue has been raised recently due to outsourcing of the chip manufacturing processes to reduce cost. This is an important consideration especially in critical applications such as avionics, communications, military, industrial and so on. A trojan is inserted into a main circuit at manufacturing and is mostly inactive unless it is triggered by a rare value or time event; then it produces a payload error in the circuit, potentially catastrophic. Because of its nature, a trojan may not be easily detected by functional or ATPG testing. The problem of trojan detection has been addressed only recently in very few works. Our work analyzes and formulates the trojan detection problem based on a frequency analysis under rare trigger values and provides procedures to generate input trigger vectors and trojan test vectors to detect trojan effects.

This interdisciplinary review discusses many different aspects of magnesium alloys comprising the manufacturing process and the latest research. We present the challenges of the manufacturing process of magnesium implants with the risk of contamination with impurities and its effect on corrosion. Furthermore, this paper provides a summary of the current examination methods used in in vitro and in vivo research of magnesium alloys. The influence of various parameters (most importantly the effect of the corrosive media) in in vitro studies and an overview about the current in vivo research is given. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

It can be categorized into three basic paradigms: digital manufacturing, digital-networked manufacturing, and new-generation intelligent manufacturing. New-generation intelligent manufacturing represents an in-depth integration of new-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technology and advanced manufacturing technology. It runs through every link in the full life-cycle of design, production, product, and service. The concept also relates to the optimization and integration of corresponding systems; the continuous improvement of enterprises’ product quality, performance, and service levels; and reduction in resources consumption. New-generation intelligent manufacturing acts as the core driving force of the new industrial revolution and will continue to be the main pathway for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry in the decades to come. Human-cyber-physical systems (HCPSs) reveal the technological mechanisms of new-generation intelligent manufacturing and can effectively guide related theoretical research and engineering practice. Given the sequential development, cross interaction, and iterative upgrading characteristics of the three basic paradigms of intelligent manufacturing, a technology roadmap for “parallel promotion and integrated development” should be developed in order to drive forward the intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry in China. © 2018 The Authors","Advanced manufacturing; Basic paradigms; Human-cyber-physical system; Integrated development; New-generation AI; New-generation intelligent manufacturing; Parallel promotion","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Life cycle; Manufacture; Product design; Advanced manufacturing; Basic paradigms; Integrated development; Intelligent Manufacturing; Parallel promotion; Industrial research","","","","","Key Laboratory of Engineering Plastics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, (2017-ZD-08)","This work was supported by a strategic research project from the Chinese Academy of Engineering ( 2017-ZD-08 ).

Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems. © 2018","Cyber-physical systems; Design for manufacturing; Information security; Internet of Things; Smart manufacturing; Sustainable manufacturing","Crime; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Flow control; Internet of things; Learning systems; Network security; Real time systems; Security of data; Supply chains; Design for Manufacturing; Digital environment; Individual technology; Industrial espionage; Internet of Things (IOT); Physical environments; Smart manufacturing; Sustainable manufacturing; Manufacture","","","","","University College London's Security Science Doctoral Training Centre; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/G037264/1)","This work was conducted under EPSRC Grant No: EP/G037264/1 as part of University College London's Security Science Doctoral Training Centre.

In the metal area of ALM, the capacity of laser technologies is noticeably limited. This is mainly due to an inertial beam deflection device, which is also referred to as a mirror galvanometer. In contrast, the electron beam technology offers high power density as well as considerable scanning rates. Therefore, electron beam melting (EBM) seems to be suitable for processing a broad variety of alloys in an economic way. In particular, the enormous scanning rates which can be realized by use of an electron beam enable an economic manufacture of high quality parts. However, profound expertise is required in order to establish EBM as an industrial production technology. By means of mathematical-physical modelling, process stability of the melting step is being increased. Moreover, by solving a detailed thermal model using the finite element method (FEM), substantial knowledge of adequate parameter settings in dependence of the utilised material is developed. Finally, a process window as a function of scan speed and beam power is developed based on experimental results. © German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP) 2009.","Additive layer manufacturing; Electron beam melting (EBM); Finite-element method (FEM); Mathematical-physical Modelling; Simulation","Electron beam furnaces; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Electron optics; Electrons; Industrial applications; Manufacture; Mathematical models; Melting; Smelting; Beam deflection; Beam power; Economic manufacture; Electron beam technology; High power density; High quality; Industrial production; Laser technologies; Layer manufacturing; Modelling and simulations; Parameter setting; Physical modelling; Process stability; Process window; Scanning rate; Simulation; Thermal model; Finite element method","","","","","","","Wohlers T., Wohlers Report 2007, Wohlers Associates Inc., (2007); Lutzmann S., Kahnert M., Sigl M., Elektronenstrahlsintern Als Zukunftstechnologie Im Rapid Tooling, (2006); Taminger K.M.B., Hafley R.A., Dicus D.L., An enabling technology for future space missions, Proceedings of the 2002 International Conference on Metal Powder Deposition for Rapid Manufacturing, pp. 51-61, (2002); Dave V.R., Electron Beam Assisted Materials Fabrication, (1995); Qi H.B., Yan Y.N., Lin F., He W., Zhang R.J., Direct metal part forming of 316L stainless steel powder by electron beam selective melting, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers-Part B-engineering Manufacture, 202, 11, pp. 1845-1853, (2006); Meindl M., Beitrag zur Entwicklung generativer Fertigungsverfahren für das Rapid Manufacturing, (2004); Dobeneck D., Lower T., Mehnhard C., Entwicklungspotenziale der thermischen Materialbearbeitung mit Elektronenstrahlen im Vergleich zu Laserstrahlen, Laserstrahlfügen: Prozesse, Systeme, Anwendungen, Trends; Beiträge zum 4, pp. 35-44, (2002); Schiller S., Heisig U., Panzer S., Elektronenstrahltechnologie, (1977); Kahnert M., Lutzmann S., Zah M.F., Layer formations in electron beam sintering, Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium Proceedings 18, Austin (Texas, USA), (2007); Gusarov A., Yadroitsev I., Bertrand P., Smurov I., Heat transfer modelling and stability analysis of selective laser melting, Applied Surface Science, 254, pp. 975-979, (2007); Zah M.F., Kahnert M., The effect of scanning strategies on electron beam sintering, Production Engineering, 3, pp. 217-224, (2009); Wirtschaftliche Fertigung Mit Rapid-Technologien: Anwender-Leitfaden Zur Auswahl Geeigneter Verfahren, (2006); Baehr H.D., Stephan K., Wärme- Und Stoffübertragung, (1998); Heinrich H., Theoretische und experimentelle Untersuchungen zur Bestimmung der Intensitätsverteilung im Strahlungsfeld von Elektronenbeschleunigern und der Dosisverteilung in elektronenbestrahlten Material, (1973); Untersuchungen zum selektiven Lasersintern von Metallen, (2003); Schlunder E.U., Tsotsas E., Wärmeübertragung in Festbetten, Durchmischten Schüttgütern Und Wirbelschichten: 33 Tabellen, (1998); Warmeatlas V.D.I., Berechnungsblätter für Den Wärmeübergang, (2002); Sih S., Barlow J.W., Emissivity of powder beds, Solid freeform fabrication symposium proceedings, Austin (Texas, USA), pp. 402-408, (1995); Groth C., Muller G., Grundlagen: Basiswissen Und Arbeitsbeispiele Zur Finite-Elemente-Methode Mit Dem FE-Programm ANSYS(R) Rev. 5.5, (2002); Bohmer R., Methodik computergestützter Prozessmodellierung, (1997)","S.

In this paper, human-robot collaboration has an important role in smart factories since it contributes to the achievement of higher productivity and greater efficiency. However, this evolution means breaking with the established safety procedures as the separation of workspaces between robot and human is removed. These changes are reflected in safety standards related to industrial robotics since the last decade, and have led to the development of a wide field of research focusing on the prevention of human-robot impacts and/or the minimization of related risks or their consequences. This paper presents a review of the main safety systems that have been proposed and applied in industrial robotic environments that contribute to the achievement of safe collaborative human-robot work. Additionally, a review is provided of the current regulations along with new concepts that have been introduced in them. The discussion presented in this paper includes multi-disciplinary approaches, such as techniques for estimation and the evaluation of injuries in human-robot collisions, mechanical and software devices designed to minimize the consequences of human-robot impact, impact detection systems, and strategies to prevent collisions or minimize their consequences when they occur. © 2013 IEEE.","human-robot collaboration; industrial robot; industrial standards; Industry 4.0; Safety","Accident prevention; Industrial research; Industrial robots; Manufacture; Robotics; Safety engineering; Current regulations; Human-robot collaboration; Industrial environments; Industrial manufacturing; Industrial robotics; Industrial standards; Intelligent Manufacturing; Multi-disciplinary approach; Robots","","","","","","","AENOR.

Under the individualized designing demands, more realistic virtual models mirroring the real worlds of production lines are essential to bridge the gap between design and operation. This paper presents a digital twin-based approach for rapid individualized designing of the hollow glass production line. The digital twin merges physics-based system modeling and distributed real-time process data to generate an authoritative digital design of the system at pre-production phase. A digital twin-based analytical decoupling framework is also developed to provide engineering analysis capabilities and support the decision-making over the system designing and solution evaluation. Three key enabling techniques as well as a case study in hollow glass production line are addressed to validate the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.","Digital twin; Individualized designing; Mass individualization; Multi-view synchronization; Semi-physical simulation","Couplings; Data structures; Decision making; Developing countries; Glass; Manufacture; Optimization; Conferences; digital twin; individualized designing; mass individualization; Multi-views; Semi-physical simulations; Bridges","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51675108, 51705091); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2015ZZ079); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2015B010128007, 2016A010106006)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51675108 and Grant 51705091, in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China under Grant 2015B010128007 and Grant 2016A010106006, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2015ZZ079.","Gao J., Yao Y., Zhu V.C.Y., Sun L., Lin L., Service-oriented manufacturing: A new product pattern and manufacturing paradigm, J.

The design freedom offered by this category of manufacturing processes and its ability to locally print almost each designable object will have important repercussions across society. While AM applications are progressing from rapid prototyping to the production of end-use products, the environmental dimensions and related impacts of these evolving manufacturing processes have yet to be extensively examined. Only limited quantitative data are available on how AM manufactured products compare to conventionally manufactured ones in terms of energy and material consumption, transportation costs, pollution and waste, health and safety issues, as well as other environmental impacts over their full lifetime. Reported research indicates that the specific energy of current AM systems is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher compared to that of conventional manufacturing processes. However, only part of the AM process taxonomy is yet documented in terms of its environmental performance, and most life cycle inventory (LCI) efforts mainly focus on energy consumption. From an environmental perspective, AM manufactured parts can be beneficial for very small batches, or in cases where AM-based redesigns offer substantial functional advantages during the product use phase (e.g., lightweight part designs and part remanufacturing). Important pending research questions include the LCI of AM feedstock production, supply-chain consequences, and health and safety issues relating to AM. © 2017 The Authors.

The manufacturing process consists of several operational steps referred to as 'unit operations' where the biologic is subjected to different stresses and conditions that may compromise quality and stability. Moreover, recently the requirement for the development of subcutaneous formulations for high dose drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies, at high protein concentrations has created additional challenges for many of the unit operations. These challenges can be mitigated by modification of the manufacturing process and/or development of formulations to prevent degradation. In particular, formulations have been designed to minimize protein aggregation and decrease viscosity, which has led to successful manufacture of the biologic. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

State-of-the-art technologies heavily rely on human intervention, thereby showing apparent limitations in practice. The burgeoning era of big data is influencing the process industries tremendously, providing unprecedented opportunities to achieve smart manufacturing. This kind of manufacturing requires machines to not only be capable of relieving humans from intensive physical work, but also be effective in taking on intellectual labor and even producing innovations on their own. To attain this goal, data analytics and machine learning are indispensable. In this paper, we review recent advances in data analytics and machine learning applied to the monitoring, control, and optimization of industrial processes, paying particular attention to the interpretability and functionality of machine learning models. By analyzing the gap between practical requirements and the current research status, promising future research directions are identified. © 2019 THE AUTHORS","Big data; Machine learning; Process systems engineering; Smart manufacturing","Big data; Data Analytics; Flow control; Learning systems; Machine learning; Manufacture; Current research status; Future research directions; Industrial manufacturing process; Machine learning models; Process systems engineering; Smart manufacturing; State-of-the-art technology; Sustainable operations; Engineering education","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61433001, 61673236, 61873142)","Chao Shang acknowledges the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61673236 , 61433001 , and 61873142 ).

This paper takes steps toward meeting that need by critically reviewing the literature and establishing a research agenda for the area. A conceptual model, which places flexibility within a broad context, helps to identify certain assumptions of theoretical studies which need to be challenged. The model also provides a basis for identifying specific flexibility dimensions. The manner in which these dimensions may limit the effectiveness of a manufacturing Trocess, and the problems in operationalizing them are discussed. Focusing next on the neglected area of applied work, concepts are presented for analyzing whether desired amounts of flexibility are being achieved and whether the potential for flexibility built into a manufacturing process is being tapped. Once more, a procedure is outlined for altering a plant's types and amounts of flexibility over time. The research agenda, which grows out of the appraisal of theoretical and applied work, indicates the value in studying generic flexibility strategies, the flexibility dimensions, methods of delivery, ways of evaluating and changing a process's flexibility, and above all measurement problems. The conclusions indicate principles for strategic research, some of which have relevance for the development of mathematical models.","","Industrial engineering; Industrial management; Industrial plants; Management science; Manufacture; Production engineering; Manufacturing flexibility; Strategic research; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027580682"

It has also been shown that flexibility can be utilized proactively to create a competitive advantage for a company. Despite the recognition that it serves a dual purpose, little work has been done to synthesize these competing uses of flexibility. This study proposes a model that not only articulates an effective use of flexibility concurrently for both proactive and reactive purposes, it also allows a simultaneous view of the opportunities and uncertainties along the value-chain. By embracing the entire value-chain, this model considers the implications of the inter-relating feedback loops within the supply-chain, which to-date has been overlooked in the flexibility literature. Such an approach provides managers with a tool that allows them to consider more options in configuring flexibility between its two competing uses. Within the model, eleven dimensions of flexibility are identified and then classified into three levels comprising a transformation process. This model is grounded in observations from a field study of 10 printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication companies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Two different inocula from wastewater treatment plants were tested. The use of an inoculum previously acclimated to high nitrate concentrations led to complete denitrification in 6 h (denitrification rate: 22.8 mg NO3- -N / g VSS h), using methanol as carbon source for a COD/N ratio of 4 and for a content of calcium in the wastewater of 150 mg/L. Higher calcium concentrations led to a decrease in the biomass growth rate and in the denitrification rate. The optimum COD/N ratio was found to be 3.4, achieving 98% nitrate removal in 7 h at a maximum rate of 30.4 mg NO3- -N / g VSS h and very low residual COD in the effluent. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Benefited from its nature as an electricity-driven capacitor, the electrocaloric working body renders the great advantages in the energy efficiency and the device integration. The decade-long efforts on advancing the technology revealed many promising material candidates with matured manufacturing protocols, as well as intriguing device prototypes for applications beyond the traditional vapor compression based cooling. This article presents the recent advances in electrocaloric cooling technologies, from material improvements to device demonstrations. The environmental impact and the energy efficiency of the technology were evaluated by the total effective warming impact and the material COP, respectively. In addition to the current progresses achieved by the decade-long research effort, the existing challenges and potential opportunities brought by the electrocaloric refrigeration will be discussed. In general, applying or removing an external work to a refrigerant can cause a reversible phase transition with heat ejection or absorption. Various thermodynamic cycles based on the liquid-gaseous phase transition are where the foundation of conventional vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) was built on. Analogous to the VCR, the electrocaloric refrigeration (ECR) utilizes an electric field to induce a dipolar order-disorder phase transition where a reversible temperature change enables the heat pumping. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) in solid-state materials a decade ago quickly revived the interests on the ECR from both academia and industrial. Numerous advances have been achieved in condensed matter physics, from normal FE to relaxor FE and from solid-state dielectrics to fluidic dielectrics. The ECE-induced temperature changes exceeded 30 K under high external electric fields. The ECR is environmentally benign. Operating a solid-state or condensed matter cooling agent, ECR emits no harmful gas directly, such as gases with ozone depletion potential (ODP) and/or global warming potential (GWP). The electrocaloric (EC) materials hold the promise of high energy efficiency because of their nature as low-loss insulators. Overall, our review shows that the ECR exhibits an incredibly low total equivalent warming impact (TEWI), with both direct and indirect equivalent CO2 emission considered. EC cooling devices have been demonstrated by researchers in university research groups as well as in R&D centers of industrial cooperation that are pioneering in the field. The uniqueness of the EC working bodies, i.e., compressor-free, low-noise, high-efficiency, flexibility, scalability, optic transparency, electromechanical maneuverability, etc., may extend the ECR to new application scenarios beyond the traditional household refrigeration and air conditioners. Future advances of the ECR could lead to point-of-care, distributive thermal management, on-chip cooling, wearable thermal management, and highly efficient climate-controlling systems for electric vehicles. The development of this interdisciplinary field calls for in-depth collaboration among research societies of condensed matter physics, material engineering, mechanical and thermal engineering, refrigeration and cryogenics, and industrial manufacturing. The global climate shift calls for a series of technical innovations that exhibit low-carbon-emission over their lifetimes. The discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect (ECE) stimulated a new research field of the environmental-benign, high-efficiency cooling technology, which extends the boundary of the conventional refrigeration as well as the condensed matter physics. In this review, we summarize the major advances of the ECE in the fundamental physics, materials, devices demos, and the state of arts over the last decade. Challenges, opportunities, and perspectives of the future development of the rejuvenated research field are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","dielectrics; electrocaloric materials and devices; energy conversions; ferroelectrics; TEWI; total equivalent warming impact; zero-GWP refrigeration","Air conditioning; Automobile bodies; Condensed matter physics; Cooling systems; Dielectric materials; Discovery wells; Electric fields; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Ferroelectric materials; Global warming; Heating; Industrial refrigeration; Industrial research; Maneuverability; Manufacture; Ozone layer; Phase transitions; Pyroelectricity; Temperature control; Thermal management (electronics); Electrocaloric; Global warming potential; Industrial manufacturing; Interdisciplinary fields; Ozone depletion potential; Reversible phase transition; TEWI; Total equivalent warming impacts; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cooling; dielectric property; electric field; energy efficiency; environmental impact; global warming; ozone depletion; Vapor compression refrigeration","","","","","NSFC-Guangdong; US Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-07CH11358); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Pennsylvania State University, PSU; Ames Laboratory; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51372042, 51776119, 51872053, U1501246); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2015A030308004); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU, (WF220402017); Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU","The authors would like to thank Prof. Neil D.

Originally developed for aerospace applications, its low density, high thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures make it an ideal material for aircraft brakes, rocket nozzles and re-entry nose tips. It withstands temperatures in excess of 2000°C without major deformation. The properties are very much dependent on the manufacturing methods used for production. Although the general production technology is known, the combination of processes to achieve specially tailored properties remains the expertise of particular manufacturers. This paper reviews major developments of Carbon-carbon composites and describes actual and future applications. Improved oxidation resistance and continuously decreasing manufacturing costs make this family of materials more and more attractive to high performance applications as well as for general engineering design. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Carbon matrix composites (A); Fibres and filaments (B); Thermal properties (E)","Aerospace applications; Aircraft landing systems; Brakes; Density (specific gravity); High temperature properties; Industrial research; Machining; Manufacture; Nozzles; Oxidation resistance; Rockets; Thermal conductivity; Aircraft brakes; Reentry nose tips; Rocket nozzles; Carbon carbon composites","","","","","","","Stimson I.L., Fisher R., Design and engineering of carbon brakes, Phil.

Nowadays, these technologies have other names such as 3D printing or additive manufacturing, and so forth, but they all have the same origins from rapid prototyping. The design and manufacturing process stood the same until new requirements such as a better integration on production line, a largest series of manufacturing or the reduce weight of products due to heavy costs of machines and materials. The ability to produce complex geometries allows proposing of design and manufacturing solutions in the industrial field in order to be ever more effective. The additive manufacturing (AM) technology develops rapidly with news solutions and markets which sometimes need to demonstrate their reliability. The community needs to survey some evolutions such as the new exchange format, the faster 3D printing systems, the advanced numerical simulation or the emergence of new use. This review is addressed to persons who wish have a global view on the AM and improve their understanding. We propose to review the different AM technologies and the new trends to get a global overview through the engineering and manufacturing process. This article describes the engineering and manufacturing cycle with the 3D model management and the most recent technologies from the evolution of additive manufacturing. Finally, the use of AM resulted in new trends that are exposed below with the description of some new economic activities. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing;

While only recently studied, IC piracy has now become a major challenge for the electronics and defense industries [6]. We propose a novel comprehensive technique to end piracy of integrated circuits (EPIC). It requires that every chip be activated with an external key, which can only be generated by the holder of IP rights, and cannot be duplicated. EPIC is based on (i) automatically-generated chip IDs, (ii) a novel combinational locking algorithm, and (iii) innovative use of public-key cryptography. Our evaluation suggests that the overhead of EPIC on circuit delay and power is negligible, and the standard flows for verification and test do not require change. In fact, major required components have already been integrated into several chips in production. We also use formal methods to evaluate combinational locking and computational attacks. A comprehensive protocol analysis concludes that EPIC is surprisingly resistant to various piracy attempts. © 2008 EDAA.","","Cryptography; Electronics industry; Finance; Formal methods; Industrial engineering; Internet protocols; Investments; Manufacture; Networks (circuits); Public key cryptography; Standards; Testing; Capital investments; Circuit delays; Defense industries; External key; Protocol analysis; Semiconductor manufacturing; Integrated circuits","","","","","","","Alkabani Y., Koushanfar F., Active hardware metering for intellectual property protection and security, USENIX Security, pp. 291-306, (2007); Alkabani Y., Koushanfar F., Potkonjak M., Remote activation of ICs for piracy prevention and digital rights management, IEEE/ACM ICCAD, pp. 674-677, (2007); Anderson R., Security Engineering: A guide to building dependable distributed systems, (2001); Brglez F., Fujiwara H., A neutral netlist of 10 combinational circuits and a target translator in FORTRAN, IEEE ISCAS, (1985); Clarke P., Fake NEC company found, says report, (2006); study on High Performance Microchip Supply; Ferguson N., Schneier B., Practical Cryptography, (2003); Hachtel G.D., Somenzi F., Logic Synthesis and Verification Algorithms, (2000); Koushanfar F., Qu G., Potkonjak M., Intellectual property metering, Inf.

It will seek to demonstrate that features of the micro and meso-structure which are directly attributable to design decisions must be rigorously identified; and the influence of those features on composite properties must be explicitly included in determining allowable properties. We can then recategorise what we currently experience as defects into design induced defects, which might more properly be regarded as features, and process induced defects which are truly defect states that we can influence by correct choice of manufacturing conditions. Critically, it is necessary that true defect states and variability must be clearly distinguished from inherent or designed-in features as the latter cannot be eliminated by improvements in manufacturing processes. Design defects can only be avoided at the design stage. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","B. Defects; B. Mechanical properties; C. Autoclave; C.

Through the tests, mechanical properties, such as tensile and compressive strengths, hardness, impact strength, and heat resistance, and surface roughness, geometric and dimensional accuracy, manufacturing speed, and material costs were compared for each process and machine. It was verified that the SL process is advantageous in hardness, accuracy, and surface roughness and the Poly-jet process in tensile strength at room temperature. The SLS process was advantageous in compressive strength and manufacturing speed, the 3DP process in speed and material costs, and the LOM process in heat resistance. The FDM and LOM processes were superior in impact strength in the scanning direction, but the change of building direction significantly reduced the tensile and impact strengths. © IMechE 2008.","Accuracy; Benchmark test; Building direction; Layer manufacturing process; Mechanical properties; Surface roughness","Compressive strength; Concurrent engineering; Dynamic positioning; Error analysis; Frequency division multiplexing; Friction; Hardness; Health; Heat resistance; Ice; Impact resistance; Impact strength; Industrial engineering; Job analysis; Lithography; Mechanical properties; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Percolation (solid state); Pigments; Printing properties; Product development; Pulsed laser deposition; Rapid prototyping; Scanning; Sintering; Sonoluminescence; Specific heat; Speed; Steel analysis; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Surfaces; Tensile properties; Tensile strength; Three dimensional; (1 1 0) surface; (e ,3e) process; (PL) properties; Benchmark study; Dimensional accuracy; Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Laminated object manufacturing (LOM); layer manufacturing; Material costs; prototyping; Room-temperature (RT); Selective laser sintering (SLS); Stereolithography (SLA); Strength (IGC: D5/D6); Three dimensional printing (3DP); Strength of materials","","","","","","","Wohler T.T., Wohlers report 2005, Rapid prototyping & manufacturing state of the industry annual worldwide progress report, (2005); Pham D.T., Gault R.S., A comparison of rapid prototyping technologies, Int.

In recent years, there have been major advances in understanding their taxonomy, molecular biology, and physiology, and in methods for their isolation and identification. AAB are obligate aerobes that oxidize sugars, sugar alcohols, and ethanol with the production of acetic acid as the major end product. This special type of metabolism differentiates them from all other bacteria. Recently, the AAB taxonomy has been strongly rearranged as new techniques using 16S rRNA sequence analysis have been introduced. Currently, the AAB are classified in ten genera in the family Acetobacteriaceae. AAB can not only play a positive role in the production of selected foods and beverages, but they can also spoil other foods and beverages. AAB occur in sugar- and alcohol-enriched environments. The difficulty of cultivation of AAB on semisolid media in the past resulted in poor knowledge of the species present in industrial processes. The first step of acetic acid production is the conversion of ethanol from a carbohydrate carried out by yeasts, and the second step is the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid carried out by AAB. Vinegar is traditionally the product of acetous fermentation of natural alcoholic substrates. Depending on the substrate, vinegars can be classified as fruit, starch, or spirit substrate vinegars. Although a variety of bacteria can produce acetic acid, mostly members of Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter, and Gluconobacter are used commercially. Industrial vinegar manufacturing processes fall into three main categories: slow processes, quick processes, and submerged processes. AAB also play an important role in cocoa production, which represents a significant means of income for some countries. Microbial cellulose, produced by AAB, possesses some excellent physical properties and has potential for many applications. Other products of biotransformations by AAB or their enzymes include 2-keto-L-gulonic acid, which is used for the production of vitamin C; D-tagatose, which is used as a bulking agent in food and a noncalorific sweetener; and shikimate, which is a key intermediate for a large number of antibiotics. Recently, for the first time, a pathogenic acetic acid bacterium was described, representing the newest and tenth genus of AAB.

Keck Center for 3D Innovation, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, United States","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid manufacturing system that integrates stereolithography (SL) and direct print (DP) technologies to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) structures with embedded electronic circuits. A detailed process was developed that enables fabrication of monolithic 3D packages with electronics without removal from the hybrid SL/DP machine during the process. Successful devices are demonstrated consisting of simple 555 timer circuits designed and fabricated in 2D (single layer of routing) and 3D (multiple layers of routing and component placement). Design/methodology/approach - A hybrid SL/DP system was designed and developed using a 3D Systems SL 250/50 machine and an nScrypt micro-dispensing pump integrated within the SL machine through orthogonally-aligned linear translation stages. A corresponding manufacturing process was also developed using this system to fabricate 2D and 3D monolithic structures with embedded electronic circuits. The process involved part design, process planning, integrated manufacturing (including multiple starts and stops of both SL and DP and multiple intermediate processes), and post-processing. SL provided substrate/mechanical structure manufacturing while interconnections were achieved using DP of conductive inks. Simple functional demonstrations involving 2D and 3D circuit designs were accomplished. Findings - The 3D micro-dispensing DP system provided control over conductive trace deposition and combined with the manufacturing flexibility of the SL machine enabled the fabrication of monolithic 3D electronic structures. To fabricate a 3D electronic device within the hybrid SL/DP machine, a process was developed that required multiple starts and stops of the SL process, removal of uncured resin from the SL substrate, insertion of active and passive electronic components, and DP and laser curing of the conductive traces. Using this process, the hybrid SL/DP technology was capable of successfully fabricating, without removal from the machine during fabrication, functional 2D and 3D 555 timer circuits packaged within SL substrates. Research limitations/implications - Results indicated that fabrication of 3D embedded electronic systems is possible using the hybrid SL/DP machine. A complete manufacturing process was developed to fabricate complex, monolithic 3D structures with electronics in a single set-up, advancing the capabilities of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Although the process does not require removal of the structure from the machine during fabrication, many of the current sub-processes are manual. As a result, further research and development on automation and optimization of many of the sub-processes are required to enhance the overall manufacturing process. Practical implications - A new methodology is presented for manufacturing non-traditional electronic systems in arbitrary form, while achieving miniaturization and enabling rugged structure. Advanced applications are demonstrated using a semi-automated approach to SL/DP integration. Opportunities exist to fully automate the hybrid SL/DP machine and optimize the manufacturing process for enhancing the commercial appeal for fabricating complex systems. Originality/value - This work broadly demonstrates what can be achieved by integrating multiple AM technologies together for fabricating unique devices and more specifically demonstrates a hybrid SL/DP machine that can produce 3D monolithic structures with embedded electronics and printed interconnects. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","3D structural electronics;

Visionary but quite realistic concepts such as the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, Cloud-based Manufacturing and Smart Manufacturing are drivers of the so called Fourth Industrial Revolution which is commonly referred to as Industry 4.0. Although a common agreement exists on the necessity for technological advancement of production technologies and business models in the sense of Industry 4.0, a major obstacle lies in the perceived complexity and abstractness which partly hinders its quick transformation into industrial practice. To overcome these burdens, we suggest a Scenario-based Industry 4.0 Learning Factory concept that we are currently planning to implement in Austria's first Industry 4.0 Pilot Factory. The concept is built upon a tentative competency model for Industry 4.0 and the use of scenarios for problem-oriented learning of future production engineering. © 2016 The Authors.","Industry 4.0; learning factory; scenario-based learning; smart manufacturing","Couplings; Flow control; Manufacture; Production; Industrial revolutions; Learning factory; Manufacturing process; Problem-oriented learning; Production technology; Scenario based learning; Smart manufacturing; Technological advancement; Engineering education","","","","","Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","The TU Wien Industry 4.0 Pilot Factory has been partly funded by the public through the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and several private industrial firms – our partners in the project.","Zhou J., Digitalization and intelligentization of manufacturing industry, "" Adv.

Our intent is to understand the current state of research in Industry 4.0 in different disciplines and deduce insights and opportunities for future research in operations management. In this paper, we provide a focused analysis to examine the state-of-the-art research in Industry 4.0. To learn about researchers’ perspectives about Industry 4.0, we conducted a large-scale, cross-disciplinary and global survey on Industry 4.0 topics among researchers in industrial engineering, operations management, operations research, control and data science at the 9th IFAC MIM 2019 Conference in Berlin in August 2019. By using our survey findings and literature analysis, we build structural and conceptual frameworks to understand the current state of knowledge and to propose future research opportunities for operations management scholars.

There is a growing demand for smart prognostics of bearing remaining useful life (RUL). The data driven approach for bearing RUL prediction has shown promising potential to support smart prognostics. The recent advances in deep learning and industrial big data provide new solutions for data driven bearing RUL prediction yet still face significant challenges, e.g. optimal feature selection and efficient feature compression. This paper proposes a new deep learning based prediction framework for bearing RUL by using deep autoencoder and deep neural networks (DNN). A novel eigenvector based on time–frequency-wavelet joint features is proposed to effectively represent bearing degradation process. A deep autoencoder based joint features compression and computing method is presented to retain effective information without increasing the scale of DNN. The experiment results showed that the proposed method can achieve better efficiency in bearing RUL prediction. © 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Deep learning; Industrial big data; Prognostics;

The literature classification was performed based on six parameters: research method, country, healthcare area, implementation, lean tools and methods and results. From the analysis performed, this paper presents a quantitative analysis of the state of the art concerning lean healthcare and indicates current research trends, based on the stage of evolution of the area, that may guide further studies on the subject. An example is lean healthcare expansion to other countries, such as Brazil and the Netherlands. Another aspect is the application of lean healthcare in hospital as a whole, not limited to a specific setting. Finally, a few studies detail the lean implementation process and use infrequently applied tools, present the barriers and main critical factors found in the lean implementation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Lean healthcare;

Nevertheless, to fully understand the manufacturing system, e.g. vibrations, deflections or thermal deformations, the interactions between the manufacturing process and the machine tool also have to be analysed. In cutting, grinding and forming there are important effects that can only be explained through these interaction phenomena. This paper presents the current state of research in process-machine interactions for a wide variety of manufacturing processes. It is based on the findings of the CIRP research group ""Process Machine Interaction (PMI)"" and on the international publications in this field. Cutting with defined and undefined cutting edges as well as sheet and bulk metal forming are the key processes. The emphasis is on understanding, modelling and simulating all modes of interaction. Additional needs of research in process-machine interaction are identified for future projects. © 2009 CIRP.","Machine; Modelling; Process-machine interaction","Industrial engineering; Machine tools;

Installation of the main equipment then began, and the power plant is currently progressing well toward connecting to the grid at the end of 2017. The thermal power of a single HTR-PM reactor module is 250 MWth, the helium temperatures at the reactor core inlet/outlet are 250/750 °C, and a steam of 13.25 MPa/567 °C is produced at the steam generator outlet. Two HTR-PM reactor modules are connected to a steam turbine to form a 210 MWe nuclear power plant. Due to China's industrial capability, we were able to overcome great difficulties, manufacture first-of-a-kind equipment, and realize series major technological innovations. We have achieved successful results in many aspects, including planning and implementing R&D, establishing an industrial partnership, manufacturing equipment, fuel production, licensing, site preparation, and balancing safety and economics; these obtained experiences may also be referenced by the global nuclear community. © 2016 THE AUTHORS","High-temperature gas-cooled reactor; High-temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module; Modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor; Nuclear energy; Pebble bed","Accident prevention; Computation theory; Equipment, devices and apparatus; Gas cooled reactors; Gases; High temperature engineering; High temperature gas reactors; High temperature reactors; Manufacture; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Pebble bed reactors; Steam generators; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; System theory; Helium temperatures; Industrial capabilities; Industrial partnerships; Manufacturing equipment; Modular high temperature gas cooled reactor; Pebble beds; Shandong province; Technological innovation; Pebble bed modular reactors","","","","","","","Reutler H., Lohnert H., Advantages of going modular in HTRs, Nucl Eng Des, 78, 2, pp. 129-136, (1984); US DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, Generation IV International Forum, A technology roadmap for Generation IV nuclear energy systems, (2002); Clery D., Reactors: nuclear industry dares to dream of a new dawn, Science, 309, 5738, pp. 1172-1175, (2005); Wu Z.X., Lin D.C., Zhong D.X., The design features of the HTR-10, Nucl Eng Des, 218, 1-3, pp. 25-32, (2002); Zhang Z.Y., Wu Z.X., Wang D.Z., Xu Y.H., Sun Y.L., Li F., Et al., Current status and technical description of Chinese 2 × 250 MWth HTR-PM demonstration plant, Nucl Eng Des, 239, 7, pp. 1212-1219, (2009); Baumer R., Barnert H., Baust E., Association of German Engineers, The Society for Energy Technologies, Et al., AVR–experimental high-temperature reactor: 21 years of successful operation for a future energy technology, (1990); Zhang Z.Y., Sun Y.L., Economic potential of modular reactor nuclear power plants based on the Chinese HTR-PM project, Nucl Eng Des, 237, 23, pp. 2265-2274, (2007)","Z.

More importantly, managing volatile demand specifically in the development of lubricant efficiently can be a huge significant to the rapid technological improvements in various engineering and manufacturing industries. To date, tailor-made ionic liquids (IL) investigated for application as lubricants has known to play an important role in enhancing tribological interactions between sliding materials. Present interest concerns recent applications and emerging fields for the utilization of IL as new advanced lubricants. The rheological properties of IL, including their physical and chemical characteristics have shown to be better than conventional lubricants. In regard to applications, we address versatile advances in IL as neat lubricants or additives on different sliding pairs. Following on from this, recent technical developments, industrial applications, biodegradability issues, environmental hazards and future prospects as an excellence potential replacement to the conventional lubricants are outlined. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Boundary film; Ionic liquids; Lubricant additives; Renewable sources; Sustainable lubricants","Biodegradability; Biohazards; Industrial research; Ionic liquids; Liquids; Manufacture; Boundary films; Engineering and manufacturing; Environmentally benign; Lubricant additives; Physical and chemical characteristics; Renewable sources; Technological improvements; Tribological interaction; Lubricants","","","","","Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE; Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter, FOM","Funding text 1: The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial contribution from the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (MOHE) and Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia for the financial support via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme under Vot. 1467 and Vot. 1591.; Funding text 2: The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial contribution from the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia (MOHE) and Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia for the financial support via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme under Vot. 1467 and Vot. 1591 .","Anand M., Hadfield M., Viesca J.L., Thomas B., Hernandez Battez A., Austen S., Ionic liquids as tribological performance improving additive for in-service and used fully-formulated diesel engine lubricants, Wear, 334-335, pp. 67-74, (2015); Andreani L., Rocha J.D., Use of ionic liquids in biodiesel production: a review, Braz.

The process has attracted much attention from academia and industry over the past two decades. The technical interest in cold spraying is twofold: first as a coating process for applications in surface technology, and second as a solid-state additive manufacturing process, offering an alternative to selective laser melting or electron beam melting methods. Moreover, cold spraying can be used to study materials behaviour under extremely high strain rates, high pressures and high cooling rates. The cold spraying process is thus considered to be relevant for various industrial applications, as well as for fundamental studies in materials science. This article aims to provide an overview of the cold spray process, the current understanding of the deposition mechanisms, and the related models and experiments, from a materials science perspective. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Coating; Cold spraying; Deformation; Deposition mechanism","3D printers; Coatings; Deformation; Deposition; Laser applications; Manufacture; Melting; Powder coatings; Strain rate; Additive manufacturing process; Cold spray process; Cold spraying; Deposition mechanism; Fundamental studies; High cooling rates; Selective laser melting; Surface technology; High pressure engineering","","","","","German Foundation of Industrial Research Associations; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N007638/1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (KL1945/1, KR 1109/); Volkswagen Foundation; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (03SF0482); Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF, (15.503 N, IGF 12.671 N); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie, BMWi; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (16IN0695)","The authors thankfully acknowledge the German Research Foundation (DFG) , grant numbers KR 1109/ and KL1945/1 ; the German Foundation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) , grant numbers IGF 12.671 N , 15.503 N , 17135 N , 18449 BG ; the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) , grant number 16IN0695 ; the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) , grant number 03SF0482 ; and the Volkswagen Foundation , grant number Experiment 88 903 for financially supporting the research on cold spraying at Helmut Schmidt University Hamburg.","Alkhimov A.P., Kosarev V.F., Nesterovich N.I., Papyrin A.N., (1986); Alkhimov A.P., Kosarev V.F., Papyrin A.N., A method of cold gas-dynamic deposition, Sov.

ASME Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, California State University, 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, 90840, CA, United States","Additive manufacturing (AM) has become a serious and potential game-changing method of manufacturing over the years since the first commercial technology for ""Rapid Prototyping"" in 1988. Even though we are advanced, the current accomplishments are still far from the level which can be expected in the future. Innovative approaches toward design are required to capture the full potential of this technology. This paper describes the advantages and possibilities of AM technologies, and how they can be used in various sectors (e.g., engineering, automotive, aerospace, medical, and consumer products, etc.) as alternative methods for manufacturing energy efficient parts with fewer raw materials. To take advantage of the capabilities of these technologies, new and enhanced design methods and procedures are required. This paper addresses strategic implications of widespread adoption of AM. It also reports how engineers need to change their thinking pattern to be able to use the full potential of the AM technologies. Engineers should be aware of the capabilities of the AM technologies and the available material selections to make the right decisions at the beginning of a design process. Also reported herein, in addition to building very complex shapes with various material mixtures, are the capabilities of fabricating lattice and hollow-core structures. Reduction of a product's weight is a great option for saving energy and cost, particularly for the automotive and aerospace sectors. However, it is still important to ensure the part has the necessary strength. The objective of the current research is to analyze and prove how certain shapes of cell structures influence the strength and flexibility of parts. Conclusion address the importance of understanding the strategic implications on AM for government officials, educators, researchers, and industrial leaders.

Technology management has traditionally focused on product-oriented research and development (R&D) and assumed a linear model of innovation, starting with science and progressing through technology and design to production. It is now increasingly recognized that this linear approach is only one of many and that production as well as product development can be a powerful and protectable source of competitive advantage. The management of production operations has improved significantly over recent years. Manufacturing companies have begun to replace conventional functional and hierarchical organizations with process approaches to operational activity and management decision making. Such approaches can lend structure and transparency to business operations, link activities more clearly to customer requirements and allow wider involvement of staff and collaborators. It is argued here that the explicit management of product and production technologies, using process thinking, can yield similar benefits. The paper links traditional views of technology management including R&D management, innovation and new product introduction with competence ideas from strategy and a resource perspective from economics. A preliminary 'process framework' for technology management is proposed, covering the range of activities from identification to protection. The framework is demonstrated, and its potential benefits explored, in the context of a pilot study of manufacturers in the measuring equipment and domestic appliance industries in Europe, the United States and Japan.","","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Process engineering; Product design; Production engineering; Research and development management; Strategic planning; Systems engineering; Business process analysis; Business process design; Process approach; Process framework; Process thinking; Production operations; Production technologies; Technology management; Industrial management","","","","","","","","","","MEP","","","","","","09544054","","PIBME","","English","Proc Inst Mech Eng Part B J Eng Manuf","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029510211"

In this study, treatment of two different types of whey by using different membrane processes namely ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO) was investigated to produce cleaner discharge and to recover the proteins in whey for re-use. Membrane modules were tested as one stage operations and cascade operations by employing a combination of membrane modules in series. Nanofiltration, when operated in one stage, produced the best results from the point of treatment capacity, COD removal, and protein recovery. 30.8 L/m2h of permeate flux value at transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 8 bar was reached with nanofiltration which produced permeate with COD load of 2,787 mg O2/L, and the protein rejection was 88%. Additionally, the influent whey was concentrated 6.8 times its original volume. Among the applied cascade operations, the NF + RO combination produced the best results. Another achievement of this combination is its capability of recovering both protein and lactose separately, protein recovery in the first stage and lactose recovery in the second stage. © 2008.","COD reduction; Nanofiltration; Reverse osmosis; Ultrafiltration; Volume reduction; Whey","Industrial engineering; Nanofiltration; Ultrafiltration; chemical oxygen demand; membrane; osmosis; protein; ultrafiltration; cheese manufacturing; High organic; Perfor mance comparison; Wastewater treatment","","","","","Bogazici University BAP, (04 Y106)","The authors acknowledge Bogazici University BAP for funding this research (04 Y106) and SUTAS A.S. for supplying wastewater.","Walzem R.L., Dillard C.J., German J.B., Whey components: millennia of evolution create functionalities for mammalian nutrition: What we know and what we may be overlooking, Crit.

Ingenieria Tecnica Industrial, C/ Ronda Valencia, 3, Spain","The geometrical factors defining an adhesive joint are of great importance as its design greatly conditions the performance of the bonding. One of the most relevant geometrical factors is the thickness of the adhesive as it decisively influences the mechanical properties of the bonding and has a clear economic impact on the manufacturing processes or long runs. The traditional mechanical joints (riveting, welding, etc.) are characterised by a predictable performance, and are very reliable in service conditions. Thus, structural adhesive joints will only be selected in industrial applications demanding mechanical requirements and adverse environmental conditions if the suitable reliability (the same or higher than the mechanical joints) is guaranteed. For this purpose, the objective of this paper is to analyse the influence of the adhesive thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the joint and, by means of a statistical analysis based on Weibull distribution, propose the optimum thickness for the adhesive combining the best mechanical performance and high reliability. This procedure, which is applicable without a great deal of difficulty to other joints and adhesives, provides a general use for a more reliable use of adhesive bondings and, therefore, for a better and wider use in the industrial manufacturing processes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

American Superconductor Corporation (AMSC) has used this approach to establish a production scale manufacturing line based on a wide-web manufacturing process. This initial production line is currently capable of producing 2G wire in lengths to 500m with critical currents exceeding 250 Acmwidth -1 at 77K, in the self-field. The wide-web process, combined with slitting and lamination processes, allows customization of the 2G wire width and stabilizer composition to meet application specific wire requirements. The production line is currently supplying 2G wire for multiple cable, fault current limiter and coil applications. Ongoing R&D is focused on the development of thicker YBCO layers and improved flux pinning centers.

In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64 years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive manufacturing systems; Aging workers; Cyber-physical systems; Human factors; Smart manufacturing systems; Usability","Cognitive systems; Cyber Physical System; Design; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Flow control; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Industrial research; Manufacture; Adaptive manufacturing; Aging worker; Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Human machine interaction; Industrial case study; Pervasive technologies; Smart manufacturing; Usability; Adaptive control systems","","","","","","","(2006); Baheti R., Gill H.; Balint L., Adaptive human-computer interfaces for man-machine interaction in computer-integrated systems, Comput.

This study introduces a standardized scheme for technology and manufacturing readiness levels to contextualize a technology's development stage. We applied the scheme to a carbon nanotube (CNT) LCA and found that, regardless of synthesis technique, CNT manufacturing will become less energy intensive with increased levels of readiness. We examined the influence of production volume on LCA results using primary data from a commercial CNT manufacturer with approximately 100 grams per day production volume and engineering design of a scaled-up process with 1 tonne per day production capacity. The results show that scaling up could reduce 84% to 94% of its cradle-to-gate impacts, mainly as a result of the recycling of feedstock that becomes economically viable only beyond certain minimum production volume. This study shows that LCAs on emerging technologies based on immature data should be interpreted in conjunction with their technology and manufacturing readiness levels and reinforces the need of standardizing and communicating information on these readiness levels and scale of production in life cycle inventory practices. © 2014 by Yale University.","Carbon nanotubes (CNT); Data maturity; Industrial ecology; Learning curve; Nanotechnology; Scaling","Carbon; Life cycle; Manufacture; Nanotechnology; Yarn; Data maturity; Emerging technologies; Industrial ecology; Large-scale production; Learning curves; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Scaling; carbon; industrial ecology; inventory; learning; life cycle analysis; nanotechnology; scale effect; technological change; Carbon nanotubes","","","","","","","Alcorta L., The impact of new technologies on scale in manufacturing industries: Issues and evidence, World Development, 22, 5, pp. 755-769, (1994); Bare J.C., TRACI: The tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 6, 3-4, pp. 49-78, (2002); Bauer C., Buchgeister J., Hischier R., Poganietz W., Schebek L., Warsen J., Towards a framework for life cycle thinking in the assessment of nanotechnology, Journal of Cleaner Production, 16, 8-9, pp. 910-926, (2008); Bernesson S., Nilsson D., Hansson P.-A., A limited LCA comparing large- and small-scale production of rape methyl ester (RME) under Swedish conditions, Biomass and Bioenergy, 26, 6, pp. 545-559, (2004); Bernesson S., Nilsson D., Hansson P.-A., A limited LCA comparing large- and small-scale production of ethanol for heavy engines under Swedish conditions, Biomass and Bioenergy, 30, 1, pp. 46-57, (2006); Bronikowski M.J., Willis P.A., Colbert D.T., Smith K.A., Smalley R.E., Gas-phase production of carbon single-walled nanotubes from carbon monoxide via the HiPco process: A parametric study, Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, and Films, 19, 4, pp. 1800-1805, (2001); Canback S., Samouel P., Price D., Do diseconomies of scale impact firm size and performance?

The innermost ""top foil"" layer traps a gas pressure film that supports a load while a layer or layers underneath provide an elastic foundation. Foil bearings are used in many lightly loaded, high-speed turbomachines such as compressors used for aircraft pressurization and small microturbines. Foil gas bearings provide a means to eliminate the oil system leading to reduced weight and enhanced temperature capability. The general lack of familiarity of the foil bearing design and manufacturing process has hindered their widespread dissemination. This paper reviews the publicly available literature to demonstrate the design, fabrication, and performance testing of both first- and second-generation bump-style foil bearings. It is anticipated that this paper may serve as an effective starting point for new development activities employing foil bearing technology.","Fluid Film Bearings; Foil Bearings; Turbines","Bearings (structural); Fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Gas lubricated bearings; Gases; Hydrodynamics; Industrial engineering; Metal foil; Metals; Optical design; Process design; Process engineering; Sheet metal; Turbines; (OTDR) technology; Bearing designs; development activities; Elastic foundation (EF); gas bearings; Gas pressures; General (CO); High speeds; Hydrodynamic bearings; Hydrodynamic gas; Manufacturing processes; Micro turbines (MT); Oil systems; Open sources; Performance testing; Starting points; Temperature capability; Turbomachines; Two layers; Foil bearings","","","","","","","Gross W.A., Gas Film Lubrication, (1962); Ma J.T.S., An Investigation of Self-Acting Foil Bearings, ASME J. of Basic Engineering, pp. 837-846, (1965); Barnett M.A., Silver A., Application of Air Bearings to High-Speed Turbomachincry, (1970); Emerson T.P., The Application of Foil Air Bearing Turbomachin-ery in Aircraft Environmental Control Systems,, Proc of the ASME Intersociety Conference on Environmental Systems, (1978); Agrawal G.L., Foil Gas Bearings Tor Turbomachinery, Proc. of 20th Intersociety Conference on Environmental Systems, (1990); Lubell D., DellaCorle C., Stanford M.K., Test Evolution and Oil-Free Engine Experience of a High Temperature Foil Air Bearing Coating, Proc. of GT2006: ASME Turbo Expo 2006, GT2006-90572, (2006); Heshmat H., Walton II J.F., DellaCorte C., Valco M., Oil-Free Turbocharger Demonstration Paves Way to Gas Turbine Engine Applications, International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition sponsored by ASME, (2000); Miller W.H., Compliant Hydrodynamic Fluid Bearing with Resilient Support Matrix,, (1980); Gray S., Bhushan B., Support Element for Compliant Hydro-dynamic Journal Bearings,, (1981); DellaCorte C., Valco M.J., Load Capacity Estimation of Foil Air Journal Bearings for Oil-Free Turbomachincry Applications, Trib.

A self-organizing map plus a back-propagation neural network (SOM-BPNN) model is proposed for creating a dynamic quality predictor. Three SOM-based dynamic extraction parameters with six manufacturing process parameters and one level of product quality were dedicated to training and testing the proposed system. In addition, Taguchi's parameter design method was also applied to enhance the neural network performance. For comparison, an additional back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model was constructed for which six process parameters were used for training and testing. The training and testing data for the two models respectively consisted of 120 and 40 samples. Experimental results showed that such a SOM-BPNN-based model can accurately predict the product quality (weight) and can likely be used for various practical applications. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to industrial robots in an enclosed environment, cobots need additional mechanisms to assure humans’ safety in collaborations. It is especially true when a cobot is used in manufacturing environment; since the workload or moving mass is usually large enough to hurt human when a contact occurs. In this article, we are interested in understanding the existing studies on cobots, and especially, the safety requirements, and the methods and challenges of safety assurance. The state of the art of safety assurance of cobots is discussed at the aspects of key functional requirements (FRs), collaboration variants, standardizations, and safety mechanisms. The identified technological bottlenecks are (1) acquiring, processing, and fusing diversified data for risk classification, (2) effectively updating the control to avoid any interference in a real-time mode, (3) developing new technologies for the improvement of HMI performances, especially, workloads and speeds, and (4) reducing the overall cost of safety assurance features. To promote cobots in manufacturing applications, the future researches are expected for (1) the systematic theory and methods to design and build cobots with the integration of ergonomic structures, sensing, real-time controls, and human-robot interfaces, (2) intuitive programming, task-driven programming, and skill-based programming which incorporate the risk management and the evaluations of biomechanical load and stopping distance, and (3) advanced instrumentations and algorithms for effective sensing, processing, and fusing of diversified data, and machine learning for high-level complexity and uncertainty. The needs of the safety assurance of integrated robotic systems are specially discussed with two development examples. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","And integrated systems; Collaborative robots (cobots); Human-machine interface (hmi); Human-robot collaboration (hrc); Industrial robots; Safety assurance","Accident prevention; Agricultural robots; Engineering education; Industrial robots; Information management; Machine design; Machine learning; Manufacture; Manufacturing data processing; Real time control; Risk management; Robot programming; Robotics; Collaborative robots; Functional requirement; Human-Robot Interface; Intuitive programming; Manufacturing applications; Manufacturing environments; Risk classification; Systematic theories; Social robots","","","","","","","Jiang H., Zhao S., Yin K., Yuan Y., Bi Z.M., An analogical induction approach to technology standardization and technology development, Syst Res Behav Sci, 31, 3, pp. 366-382, (2014); Matthias B., (2020); Bi Z.M., Revisit system architecture for sustainable manufacturing, Journal of Sustainability, 3, 9, pp. 1323-1340, (2011); Bi Z.M., Embracing internet of things (IoT) and big data for industrial informatics, Enterprise Information Systems, 11, 7, pp. 949-951, (2017); Bi Z.M., Miao Z.H., Zhang B., Zhang W.J., The state of the art of testing standards for integrated robotic systems, Robotics and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 63, (2020); Bi Z.M., Lang S.Y.T., Wang L., Improved control and simulation models of a tricycle collaborative robot, J Intell Manuf, 19, 6, pp. 715-722, (2008); Bi Z.M., Wang L., Dynamic control model of the cobot with three omni-wheels, Robotics and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 26, 6, pp. 558-563, (2010); Beaupre M., (2020); Bi Z.M., Xu L.D., Wang C., Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing, IEEE Trans. on Industrial Informatics, 10, 2, pp. 1537-1546, (2014); Ostergaard E., (2020); (2020); (2020); Wang J., Dou R., Muddada R.R., Zhang W.J., Management of a holistic supply case study, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 125, pp. 668-677, (2018); Bi Z.M., Lang S.Y.T., Shen W.M., Reconfigurable manufacturing systems: the state of the art, Int.

The study arose from the identification of the need for to provide data for the development of an LCA profile for the electricity mix in Mauritius. The system is limited geographically to the island of Mauritius and is intended to be the representative of current agricultural techniques practiced and current manufacturing processes used by Mauritian sugar mills. The unit operations that make up the system are the growing and harvesting of sugar cane, the transport of the harvested cane to sugar mills, the production of bagasse as a by-product from the sugar milling process, and the combustion of bagasse to generate heat and electricity. The functional unit of the study is the generation of 1 GWh of electricity exported to the national electricity grid. The characterised data for 1 GWh of bagasse-derived electricity were compared with data for 1 GWh of coal-derived electricity, using the same set of characterisation factors. The results of this comparison indicate that bagasse-derived electricity performs well in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and non-renewable energy inputs, but performs poorly in relation to water consumption and eutrophication. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the complexity theory presented in this keynote paper, the complexity is defined as the measure of uncertainty in achieving the functional requirements (FRs) of a system within their specified design range. This definition of complexity leads to the existence of four different types of complexity: time-independent real complexity, time-independent imaginary complexity, time-dependent combinatorial complexity, and time-dependent periodic complexity. According to this complexity theory, complexity of any system can be reduced by taking the following actions: (1) minimize the number of functional requirements (FRs), (2) eliminate the time-independent real complexity, (3) eliminate the time-independent imaginary complexity, (4) transform a system with time-dependent combinatorial complexity into a system with time-dependent periodic complexity by introducing functional periodicity and by reinitializing the system at the beginning of each period. The importance of the functional periodicity in reducing time-dependent combinatorial complexity is illustrated using examples.","Axiomatic design; Complexity; Engineering","Combinatorial mathematics; Control system analysis; Cost accounting; Functional assessment; Large scale systems; Axiomatic design; Complexity theory; Functional requirements (FR); Manufacturing systems; Industrial engineering","","","","","","","Suh N.P., Complexity: Theory and Applications, (2005); Peklenik J., Structrual and operational complexity of future manufacturing systems, Proceedings of the 29th CIRP International Seminar on Manufacturing Systems, (1997); Peklenik J., Cybernetic structure, newtworks, and adaptive control of work systems in manufacturing, Manufacturing Technologies for Machines of the Future, (2003); Schuh G., Release-engineering - An approach to control rising system-complexity, CIRP Annals, 53, 1, (2004); Weule H., Spath D., Riedmiller S., Schreiber M., Optimization of production systems using a fuzzy expert system and computer simulation, Production Engineering, 3, 2, pp. 127-130; Warschat J., Cebulla T., Speechact based on team oriented communication system, 3rd International Workshop on Emergent Synthesis - IWES '01; Spath D., Lanza G., Herrn M., Multi agent systems for multi enterprise scheduling, Conference on Digital Enterprise - New Challenges, (2001); Feldman D.P., Crutchfield J., A Survey of ""Complexity Measures"", (1998); Suh N.P., The Principles of Design, (1990); Suh N.P., A Theory of complexity, periodicity, and design axioms, Research in Engineering Design, 11, pp. 116-131, (1999); Suh N.P., Axiomatic Design: Advances and Applications, (2001); Suh N.P., Cho N.H., (2004); Suh N.P., Lee T.S., Jeziorek P., Axiomatic Design for NASA's CEV and Architecture Design and Its Trade Study, (2004); Bathurst S., Brown C., Cantor G., Lee T.S., Oh H.L., Suh N.P., Axiomatic Design of Crew Survivability System for Orbital Space Plane, (2003); Suh N.P., On functional periodicity as the basis for long-term stability of engineered and natural systems and its relationship to physical laws, Research in Engineering Design, 15, pp. 72-75, (2004); Suh N.P., Lee T., Reduction of complexity of manufacturing systems through the creation of time-dependent periodic complexity from time-dependent combinatorial complexity, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 33, 2, (2004); Suh N.P., Lee T., (2004); Suh N.P., Tribophysics, (1986); Suh N.P., Saka N., Surface engineering, Annals of CIRP, 36, pp. 403-408, (1987); Ayala H.M., Hart D.P., Yeh O., Boyce M.C., Wear of elastomeric seals in abrasive slurries, Wear, 220, pp. 9-24, (1998); Suh N.P., Sweetland M.; Suh N.P., Sweetland M., Design of tribological systems, World Tribology Congress","","","Hallwag Publishing Ltd","","","","","","00078506","","CIRAA","","English","CIRP Ann Manuf Technol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-32044442958"

This has been defined by the authors to be “The use and integration of biological and bio-inspired principles, materials, functions, structures and resources for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing technologies and systems with the aim of achieving their full potential.” In this White Paper, detailed consideration is given to the meaning and implications of “Biologicalisation” from the perspective of the design, function and operation of products, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, supply chains and organisations. The drivers and influencing factors are also reviewed in detail and in the context of significant developments in materials science and engineering. The paper attempts to test the hypothesis of this topic as a breaking new frontier and to provide a vision for the development of manufacturing science and technology from the perspective of incorporating inspiration from biological systems. Seven recommendations are delivered aimed at policy makers, at funding agencies, at the manufacturing research community and at those industries involved in the development of next generation manufacturing technology and systems. It is concluded that it is valid to argue that Biologicalisation in Manufacturing truly represents a new and breaking frontier of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 and that the market potential is very strong. It is evident that extensive research and development is required in order to maximise on the benefits of a biological transformation. © 2018 CIRP","Bio-inspired; Bio-integrated; Bio-intelligent; Biological transformation; Biologicalisation in Manufacturing; Cyber-physical systems; Digitalisation; Industrie 4.0; Industry 4.0; International perspective; Manufacturing","Biological materials; Biology; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Manufacture; Product design; Supply chains; Bio-inspired; Bio-integrated; Bio-intelligent; Biological transformation; Digitalisation; Industrie 4.0; International perspective; Industrial research","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","In many countries, activities and cooperations have been initiated between engineering and biomimicry organisations or biologists, academia and industry.

However, to design a sustainable manufacturing system, a multitude of system dimensions must be jointly optimized. This paper proposes an integrated simulation tool helping to maximize production efficiency and balance environmental constraints already in the system design phase. Lean manufacturing, identification and elimination of waste and production losses, and environmental considerations are all needed during development of a sustainable manufacturing system. Engineers designing the manufacturing system need decision support, otherwise sub-optimization is more likely to occur. We present methods for calculating energy efficiency, CO2 emissions and other environmental impacts integrated into factory simulation software. © 2008 IEEE.","","Computer software; Decision support systems; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Manufacture; Systems analysis; Co2 emissions; Decision supports; Digital engineering tools; Environmental considerations; Environmental constraints; Factory simulations; Integrated simulations; Lean manufacturing; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing simulations; Manufacturing systems; Production efficiencies; Production loss; Simulation-based; Sub optimizations; Sustainable manufacturing; System designs; System dimensions; Industrial applications","","","","","","","Alexander B., Barton G., Petrie J., Romagnoli J., Process Synthesis and Optimization Tools for Environmental Design: Methodology and Structure, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 24, pp. 1195-1200, (2000); Azapagic A., Clift R., Life Cycle Assessment as a Tool for Improving Process Performance.

Lean Six Sigma has a positive effect on environmental performance as defect reduction and reducing process variation leads to reduction in raw material consumption, energy consumption and reduced scrap which in turn reduces the overall environmental impacts. In this context, this study uses a Lean Six Sigma framework with environmental considerations to reduce overall defects and environmental impacts concurrently to improve the firm’s operational and environmental performance. The framework is based on Define Measure Analyze Improve Control methodology where traditional Lean Six Sigma and environmental impact assessment tools are integrated to systematically deploy LSS strategies with environmental considerations. The framework is validated with an industrial case study conducted in an Indian automotive component manufacturing organisation and the inferences are derived. On successful deployment of the framework, the internal defects was brought down to 6000 ppm from 16,000 ppm and environmental impacts was reduced to 33 Pt from 42 Pt. Deployment of the developed framework helped in improving the firm’s sigma level and also reduced the overall environmental impacts. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","DMAIC;

The degree in which enterprises can capture value from big data processing and extract useful insights represents a differentiating factor in developing controls that optimize production and protect resources. Machine learning and Big Data technologies have gained increased traction being adopted in some critical areas of planning and control. Cloud manufacturing allows using these technologies in real time, lowering the cost of implementing and deployment. In this context, the paper offers a machine learning approach for reality awareness and optimization in cloud. Specifically, the paper focuses on predictive production planning (operation scheduling, resource allocation) and predictive maintenance. The main contribution of this research consists in developing a hybrid control solution that uses Big Data techniques and machine learning algorithms to process in real time information streams in large scale manufacturing systems, focusing on energy consumptions that are aggregated at various layers. The control architecture is distributed at the edge of the shop floor for data collecting and format transformation, and then centralized at the cloud computing platform for data aggregation, machine learning and intelligent decisions. The information is aggregated in logical streams and consolidated based on relevant metadata; a neural network is trained and used to determine possible anomalies or variations relative to the normal patterns of energy consumption at each layer. This novel approach allows for accurate forecasting of energy consumption patterns during production by using Long Short-term Memory neural networks and deep learning in real time to re-assign resources (for batch cost optimization) and detect anomalies (for robustness) based on predicted energy data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anomaly detection; Big data streaming; Classifier; Cloud manufacturing; Large scale manufacturing system; Long short-term memory neural network; Machine learning; Prediction","Big data; Data streams; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Engineering education; Floors; Industrial research; Learning algorithms; Manufacture; Metadata; Multilayer neural networks; Production control; Real time systems; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Traction control; Cloud computing platforms; Intelligent decisions; Large scale manufacturing systems; Machine learning approaches; Manufacturing enterprise; Manufacturing Execution System; Real-time information; Software control systems; Learning systems","","","","","","","Bennett N., Lemoine J., What VUCA really means for you, Harv.

Environmental regulation, as an environment governance tool, exerts an important impact on the green transformation of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, this paper focused on the influencing factors of green transformation of the manufacturing industry under environmental regulation. Based on survey data of 500 Chinese manufacturing enterprises (2017), the influencing factors of green transformation were studied by developing a targeted structural equation model. The main conclusions showed that (1) human capital, financing ability, technology innovation, and government behavior all exerted significant positive impact on green transformation performance in the manufacturing industry. (2) Environmental regulation, as a moderating variable, positively affected the green transformation in the manufacturing industry by acting on technology innovation and governmental behavior; however, it decreased the positive impact of financing ability on green transformation. (3) Environmental regulation was a reversal mechanism, which affected green transformation by influencing financing capacity, technology innovation, and governmental behavior of manufacturing enterprises. The study suggested that the government should consider the positive impact of these influencing factors, and design appropriate environmental regulation policies to promote the green transformation in the manufacturing industry to achieve economic green growth. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental regulation; Influencing factors of green transformation; Manufacturing industry; Structural equation model","Engineering research; Environmental technology; Finance; Industrial economics; Manufacture; Metadata; Chinese manufacturing enterprise; Economic growths; Influencing factors of green transformation; Manufacturing enterprise; Manufacturing industries; Reversal mechanism; Structural equation modeling; Technology innovation; Environmental regulations","","","","","Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Project of Henan Provincial Department of Education, (2020-ZZJH-032); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX19_0142); Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, NUAA, (190608DF09)","This work was supported by the Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning Project of Henan Provincial Department of Education under grant 2020-ZZJH-032 ,  Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province ( KYCX19_0142 ) and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics PhD short-term visiting scholar project ( 190608DF09 ).

A strategy of energy saving is to adapt new materials or new processes; but its implementation requires radical changes of the manufacturing system and usually a heavy initial investment. The other strategy is to optimize existing manufacturing processes from the perspective of energy saving. However, an explicit relational model between machining parameters and energy cost is required; while most of the works in this field treat the manufacturing processes as black or gray boxes. In this paper, analytical energy modeling for the explicit relations of machining parameters and energy consumption is investigated, and the modeling method is based on the kinematic and dynamic behaviors of chosen machine tools. The developed model is applied to optimize the machine setup for energy saving. A new parallel kinematic machine Exechon is used to demonstrate the procedure of energy modeling. The simulation results indicate that the optimization can result in 67% energy saving for the specific drilling operation of the given machine tool. This approach can be extended and applied to other machines to establish their energy models for sustainable manufacturing. © 2012 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, very few empirical studies have reported the application of Six Sigma in SMEs; the reasons may be attributed to several myths associated with Six Sigma. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current status of QI in the UK manufacturing SMEs and report the differences in the quality management practices of Six Sigma SMEs against the ISO certified firms. Design/methodology/approach A survey-based approach was adopted to understand the established quality management practices in the UK SMEs. A short survey instrument was designed by reviewing the literature on quality improvement initiatives in SMEs. A sample of 500 manufacturing SMEs across UK was selected through stratified random sampling technique. Findings A response rate of 12.7 per cent was achieved and included respondents at senior management and middle management level across the manufacturing industry in the UK. Data analysis on the history of quality initiatives (QI) in SMEs indicated towards the trend that ISO may be the foundation or building block before embarking on lean or Six Sigma. Differences in quality management practices such as customer focused measures and method of knowledge transfer to employees, were observed in Six Sigma and ISO certified SMEs. The main reasons cited for not implementing Six Sigma in SMEs were lack of knowledge or understanding of the system and limited resources. A significant difference in the performance of Six Sigma/lean firms against ISO certified companies were observed with respect to the strategic and operational measures of organizational performance. Research limitations/implications The limited response rate from the survey in the UK manufacturing SMEs will affect the generalizability of study to entire SME population. To negate the limitations of this study, a multiple multi-level case studies will be conducted in SMEs in the next phase of doctoral research. Future study should focus on performing a global survey on quality management practices in SMEs. Originality/value The novelty of the paper lies in conducting a comparative study on the quality management practices in Six Sigma and non-Six Sigma UK SMEs and measuring its impact on the performance of the firm. This study will facilitate in demystifying the myth that Six Sigma is only applicable in large organizations. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Critical success factors; International standards; Performance management; Six Sigma; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Surveys","Electric energy storage; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial research; Information management; Knowledge management; Management; Manufacture; Population statistics; Quality assurance; Quality control; Surveys; Total quality management; Tropical engineering; Work simplification; Critical success factors; International standards; Performance management; Six Sigma; Small to medium-sized enterprises; Quality management","","","","","","","Antony J., Banuelas R., Key ingredients for the effective implementation of Six Sigma program, Measuring Business Excellence, 6, 4, pp. 20-27, (2002); Antony J., Kumar M., Labib A., Gearing Six Sigma into UK Manufacturing SMEs: an empirical assessment of critical success factors, impediments, and viewpoints of Six Sigma implementation in SMEs, Journal of Operations Research Society, 59, 4, pp. 482-493, (2008); Antony J., Kumar M., Madu C.N., Six Sigma in small and medium sized UK manufacturing enterprises: some empirical observations, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 22, 8, pp. 860-874, (2005); Brue G., Six Sigma for Small Business, (2006); Caralli R.A., The critical success factor method: establishing a foundation for enterprise security management, (2004); Daniel R.H., Management data crisis, Harvard Business Review, pp. 111-112, (1961); Easterby-Smith M., Thorpe R., Lowe A., Management Research – An Introduction, (2003); Fowler F.J., Survey Research Methods, (2002); Ghobadian A., Gallear D.N., Total quality management in SMEs, Omega: International Journal of Management Science, 24, 1, pp. 83-106, (1996); Gome A., Total quality madness, Business Review Weekly, 18, pp. 38-44, (1996); Husband S.G., Innovation in advanced professional practice: doctor of technology, (1997); Husband S.G., Mandal P., A conceptual model for quality integrated management in small and medium size enterprises, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 16, 7, pp. 699-713, (1999); Kerlinger F.N., Survey Research: In Foundations of Behavioural Research in Education, (1986); Kumar M., Critical success factors and hurdles to Six Sigma implementation: the case of a UK manufacturing SME, International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage, 3, 4, pp. 333-351, (2007); Kumar M., Antony J., Comparing the quality management practices between six sigma and ISO certified SMEs – a survey based approach, (2008); Kumar M., Antony J., Singh R.K., Tiwari M.K., Perry D., Implementing the lean sigma framework in an Indian SME: a case study, Production Planning & Control, 17, 4, pp. 407-423, (2006); Lee G.L., Oakes I., The pros and cons of TQM for smaller forms in manufacturing: some experiences down the supply chain, Total Quality Management, 6, pp. 413-426, (1995); Lin Yeb-Yun C., Success factors of small and medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan: an analysis of cases, Journal of Small Business Management, 36, 4, pp. 43-56, (1999); Rockart J., Chief executives define their own data needs, Harvard Business Review, 57, 2, pp. 238-241, (1979); Saunders M., Lewis P., Thornhill A., Research Methods for Business Students, (2003); Snee R.D., Six Sigma: the evolution of 100 years of business improvement methodology, International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage, 1, 1, pp. 4-20, (2004); Thomas A.J., Webb D., Quality systems implementation in Welsh small-to medium-sized enterprises: a global comparison and a model for change, J.

Plant proteases have been used in medicine, detergent manufacturing, and food science for many years, but their production is diminishing in favor of those of microbial origin because lower production costs. Papain, bromelain, and ficin are the most frequently employed plant proteases, although new proteases with new and more appealing physicochemical properties for industry are still emerging. DNA technology and genetic engineering shall play, without a doubt, an important role for the production of these proteases at the industrial level. The present review focuses on the applications of traditional plant proteases as well as new proteases discovered during the last 20 years, some of which have already been genetically engineered either to increase production or to strengthen some of their physicochemical properties.

While the real commissioning of a manufacturing system involves a real plant system and a real controller, the virtual commissioning deals with a virtual plant model and a real controller. The expected benefits of virtual commissioning are the reduction of debugging and correction efforts during the subsequent real commissioning stage. However, it requires a virtual plant model and hence still requires significant amount time and efforts. Two main issues are identified, the physical model construction of a virtual device, and the logical model construction of a virtual device. This paper reviews the current literature related to the two issues and proposes future research directions to achieve the full utilization of virtual commissioning technology. © 2014 Society of CAD/CAM Engineers & Techno-Press","DEVS;

Because of good biocompatibility and biodegradability, they can be used in various areas, such as long-term release system, vaccine adjuvant, tissue engineering, etc. There have been 15 products available on the US market, but the system still has many problems during development and manufacturing, such as wide size distribution, drug stability issues, and so on. Recently, many new and modified methods have been developed to overcome the above problems. Some of the methods are easy to scale up, and have been available on the market to achieve pilot scale or even industrial production scale. Furthermore, the relevant FDA guidance on the DDS is still incomplete, especially for abbreviated new drug application. In this review, we present some recent achievement of the PLGA/PLA microspheres/nanoparticles, and discuss some promising manufacturing methods. Finally, we focus on the current FDA guidance on the DDS. The review provides an overview on the development of the system in pharmaceutical industry.

CP has been adopted by companies as an important factor in enhancing industrial productivity. Sustainable projects that deal appropriately with environmental and social factors are also more likely to be the most profitable. This paper investigated the criteria and attributes that determine a successful adoption and implementation of CP in reference to PWB manufacture in Taiwan. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) methodology is used to discuss the different decision criteria that include Organizing, Systems and Technologies, Measurement and Feedback, Working environment and Worker's Culture which are all vital factors in an effective CP implementation. AHP is an efficient tool in controlling the fuzziness of the data involved in choosing the most preferred decision variables. The linguistic level of comparisons produced by the manufacturers and experts are tapped and constructed in a form of triangular fuzzy numbers in order to construct fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. The implementation of the system is demonstrated by a problem involving three stages of hierarchy which contains different criteria and attributes at a wider perspective within an environmental uncertainty. The findings advocate that these enterprises would need to setup the priorities of the CP implementation. The results suggest a generic hierarchical model of organizations of which the highest level is to be prioritized among the CP implementation factors. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Cleaner production; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process","Analytic hierarchy process; Competition; Fuzzy sets; Hierarchical systems; Production engineering; Cleaner production; Competitive advantage; Decision variables; Electronic manufacturing; Environmental practices; Environmental uncertainty; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Hierarchical model; Pair-wise comparison; Social factor; Sustainable project; Three stages; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Working environment; Manufacture","","","","","National Science Council, NSC, (NSC-96-2218-E-451-001)","The authors would like to thank the National Science Council for funding support and anonymous industrial experts to response to the questionnaire (NSC-96-2218-E-451-001).","Stone L.J., Limitations of cleaner production programs as organizational change agents.

It is the largest manufacturing enterprise in the world and one of the most resource intensive industries of all major industrial system. However, its products and processes are a significant source of environmental impact. Thus, there is a need to evaluate sustainable manufacturing performance in this industry. This paper proposes a set of initial key performance indicators (KPIs) for sustainable manufacturing evaluation believed to be appropriate to automotive companies, consisting of three factors divided into nine dimensions and a total of 41 sub-dimensions. A survey will be conducted to confirm the adaptability of the initial KPIs with the industry practices. Future research will focus on developing an evaluation tool to assess sustainable manufacturing performance in automotive companies. © 2011 IEEE.","Automotive; key performance indicators; manufacturing performance;

Among such technologies, the number of studies focussing on the laser processing of BMGs has gradually increased over the past decade. For this reason, a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art in this particular field of research is presented in this review. The reported studies are categorised into the different laser applications that have been proposed so far by the research community, namely the welding, cladding, additive layer manufacturing, micro machining and microstructure modification of BMG substrates. Due to the attractive properties of BMGs stemming from their amorphous nature, results are also presented, when available, concerning the effect of laser irradiation on the generation of crystalline precipitates during processing and the effect of these changes on the resulting material properties. This review has identified a number of gaps in the knowledge surrounding the laser processing of bulk metallic glasses. Understanding the fundamental interaction of laser energy with multi-component alloys will be necessary, as the development of lasers continues and the amount of available bulk metallic glasses increases. In particular, the crystallisation kinetics of bulk metallic glasses during laser irradiation needs to be understood to aid in the development and optimisation of processes such as welding and cladding. This could be helped by created an accurate simulation model to predict the onset of crystallisation although this is not a minor challenge, developing a complete temperature field model during laser irradiation is a complex task when considering vaporisation, plasma effects as well as chemical composition changes in the material. Besides, there is also the issue of variations in material properties as the temperature increases, particularly for BMGs whose temperature dependent properties are not well-documented. The research into the additive layer manufacturing of bulk metallic glass should continue to grow. Parametric effects need to be addressed to complete the optimisation of this process. Further investigations of the resulting crystallisation processes upon repeated melting and solidification should also aid in the process being able to be controlled more effectively. Finally, the use of laser processing of bulk metallic glass for specific application needs to be investigated further. © 2017","Additive layer manufacturing; Amorphous alloys; Bulk metallic glasses; Laser cladding; Laser processing review; Laser welding","Amorphous alloys; Glass; Industrial research; Irradiation; Laser applications; Laser beam welding; Laser cladding; Manufacture; Metallic glass; Metals; Micromachining; Processing; Substrates; Welding; Additive layer manufacturing; Bulk metallic glass; Crystalline precipitate; Laser process; Melting and solidification; Microstructure modifications; Temperature field model; Temperature-dependent properties; Laser materials processing","","","","","Welsh Government and Higher Education Funding Council for Wales","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Welsh Government and Higher Education Funding Council for Wales through the Sêr Cymru National Research Network in Advanced Engineering and Materials.","Anantharaman T.R., Metallic Glasses – Production, Properties and Applications, (1984); Axinte E., Metallic glasses from “alchemy” to pure science: present and future of design, processing and applications of glassy metals, Mater.

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only influenced both day-to-day functions of firms dramatically, but also their efforts to become more digitally mature. In this review paper, we discuss the barriers to DT before, during, and what may well continue after the COVID-19 pandemic and offer a new strategy discipline—Strategic Doing—that may be useful to manufacturing firms in achieving successful DT. We discuss the divergent definitions and drivers of DT diving deep into the barriers for manufacturing firms to mature digitally. We briefly describe digital readiness and current efforts of DT in manufacturing while describing the impact of COVID-19 on DT initiatives. We conclude by describing Strategic Doing and suggesting new paths for research in this area. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","COVID-19; Digital transformation; Digitization","Engineering; Industrial engineering; Digital transformation; Manufacturing firms; Review papers; Manufacture","","","","","Toyota Material Handling North America; Toyota Material Handling University; Purdue University, PU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Toyota Material Handling North America (TMHNA) University Research Program as part of the grant “Material Handling for Industry 4.0 in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).”; Funding text 2: Also, in 2020−21, researchers from Purdue University, with support from the Toyota Material Handling University Research program, began using the Strategic Doing discipline with SMEs facing digital transformation-related challenges in material handling.

The method is founded on basic physical assumptions regarding plastic deformations and common industry practice in manufacturing. Sheet steel coiling and cross-section roll-forming are the manufacturing processes considered. The structural mechanics employed in the method are defined for each manufacturing stage and the end result is a series of closed-form algebraic equations for the prediction of residual stresses and strains. Prediction validity is evaluated with measured residual strains from existing experiments, and good agreement is shown. The primary motivation for the development of this method is to define the initial state of a cold-formed steel member for use in a subsequent nonlinear finite element analysis. The work also has impact on our present understanding of cold-work of forming effects in cold-formed steel members. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of global sustainability, they must fulfill various requirements, not only physically and technologically but also environmentally. Therefore, their design optimization process becomes more and more complex as more engineering disciplines/domains and constraints are involved, such as electromagnetics, structural mechanics and heat transfer. This paper aims to present a review of the design optimization methods for electrical machines, including design analysis methods and models, optimization models, algorithms and methods/strategies. Several efficient optimization methods/strategies are highlighted with comments, including surrogate-model based and multi-level optimization methods. In addition, two promising and challenging topics in both academic and industrial communities are discussed, and two novel optimization methods are introduced for advanced design optimization of electrical machines. First, a system-level design optimization method is introduced for the development of advanced electric drive systems. Second, a robust design optimization method based on the design for six-sigma technique is introduced for high-quality manufacturing of electrical machines in production. Meanwhile, a proposal is presented for the development of a robust design optimization service based on industrial big data and cloud computing services. Finally, five future directions are proposed, including smart design optimization method for future intelligent design and production of electrical machines. © 2017 by the authors.

In researching the antecedents or the conditions that lead to or affect supply chain collaboration, prior studies focus on the use of interorganizational systems (IOS) but simplify or ignore its culture context. Although IOS use is necessary for supply chain collaboration to succeed, organizational culture must be taken into consideration simultaneously. Many supply chain collaborations fail due to incompatible corporate culture and the complexities involved. The objective of the study is to explore the impact of collaborative culture and IOS use on supply chain collaboration by examining a moderated mediation model. Data was collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing firms. Structural equation modeling (LISREL) was used to analyze the data. Following the steps and procedures for implementing the latent variable interaction by orthogonalizing via residual-centered approach, the model was tested. The results indicate that collaborative culture enhances supply chain collaboration directly as well as indirectly by facilitating IOS use, which in turn improves supply chain collaboration. Thus, IOS use partially mediates the relationship between collaborative culture and supply chain collaboration. Surprisingly, the moderating effect of collaborative culture on the relationship between IOS appropriation and supply chain collaboration is not supported. © 2017","Culture; Interorganizational systems; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain collaboration","Cell culture; Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Corporate culture; Inter-organizational systems; Manufacturing firms; Moderating effect; Organizational cultures; Structural equation modeling; Supply chain collaboration; Turbulent environments; Supply chains","","","","","Major Program of Social Science Foundation of Guangdong, (2016WZDXM005); National Science Foundation of SZU, (836); National Natural Science Foundation of China, (71572115)","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71572115 ; Major Program of Social Science Foundation of Guangdong under Grant No. 2016WZDXM005 ; National Science Foundation of SZU under Grant No. 836 .

The problem deals with finding optimal buffer sizes to be allocated into buffer areas in a production system to achieve a specific objective. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on buffer allocation problem in production systems. To provide a systematic review of current relevant research, first studies are grouped in two categories: 1. Reliable production lines, 2. Unreliable production lines. Next, the studies in each group are reviewed based on topology of the production line, the solution methodologies suggested and the objective function employed. The aim of this review is twofold. First, it provides an overview of recent advances in the field in order to highlight the new trends in solution methodology. Second, it presents ideas for future research by identifying gaps in the current literature. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Buffer allocation problem; Combinatorial optimization; Production systems","Combinatorial optimization;

In the U. S., major research programs are being funded to deal with big data in all five sectors (i.e., services, manufacturing, construction, agriculture and mining) of the economy. Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of available tools to undertake their acquisition, access, analytics and/or application in a reasonable amount of time. Whereas Tien (2003) forewarned about the data rich, information poor (DRIP) problems that have been pervasive since the advent of large-scale data collections or warehouses, the DRIP conundrum has been somewhat mitigated by the Big Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can support informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or valid - decisions or choices. Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data access restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with correlative data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications, appropriate actions can be undertaken with the obtained information. New acquisition, access, analytics and application technologies are being developed to further Big Data as it is being employed to help resolve the 14 grand challenges (identified by the National Academy of Engineering in 2008), underpin the 10 breakthrough technologies (compiled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013) and support the Third Industrial Revolution of mass customization. © 2013 Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","adaptive services; Big data; data access; data acquisition; data analytics; data application; decision informatics; digital manufacturing; mass customization; processes; products; third industrial revolution","Computer aided manufacturing; Data acquisition; Processing; Adaptive services; Big datum; Data access; Data analytics; Data application; Digital manufacturing; Informatics; Mass customization; products; Third industrial revolutions; Manufacture","","","","","Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services; U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy; National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine","Silicon Valley; its focus is on Big Data analytics. Led by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services (including the National Institutes of Health) and other funding agencies (including the National Science Foundation) are providing over $1B to fund mostly academic research in the core technologies associated with Big Data analytics and cloud computing A final point should be made about Big Data; as suggested throughout this paper, it has to be regarded as a permanent disruptive innovation or transformation. That is, data must be constantly acquired, accessed, analyzed and applied, resulting in new – and changing – insights that might be disruptive in nature. To profit from Big Data, one must accept uncertainty and change as a permanent state of affairs; it must be a part of any enterprise’s DNA. Indeed, some companies invite such changes by adopting processes that enable variation, not eliminate it, and by valuing disruptions over the relentless pursuit of a single vision (e.g., efficiency). As an example, Google encourages some of the company’s workers to spend 20 percent of their time on projects of their own choosing and provides additional resources to those ideas with the most merit. In short, change is the only constant; companies which do not embrace it will face the same demise as Kodak, Digital Equipment Corporation and Atari. On the other hand, those which allow for disruptive innovations, like GE and IBM, have not only survived but thrived.","Ahlquist J., Saagar K.M., Comprehending the complete customer, Analytics Magazine, pp. 36-50, (2013); Allen B., Bresnahan J., Childers L., Foster I., Kandaswamy G., Kettimuthu R., Kordas J., Link M., Martin S., Pickett K., Tuecke S., Software as a service for data scientists, Communications of the ACM, 55, 2, pp. 81-88, (2012); Appel K., Haken W.O., Solution of the four color map problem, Scientific American, 237, 4, pp. 108-121, (1977); Barbot S., Lapusta N., Avouac J.-P., Under the hood of the earthquake machine: toward predictive modeling of the seismic cycle, Science, 336, pp. 707-710, (2012); Baru C., Bhandarkar M., Nambiar R., Poess M., Rabl T., Benchmarking big data systems and the bigdata top 100 list, Big Data, pp. 60-64, (2013); Bizer C., Boncz P., Bodie M.L., Erling O.D., The meaningful use of big data: four perspectives - four challenges, SIGMOD Record, 40, 4, pp. 56-60, (2011); Black F., Scholes M., The pricing of options and corporate liabilities, Journal of Political Economy, 81, pp. 637-654, (1973); Carr N., The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, (2010); Chen H., Chiang R.H.L., Storey V.C., Business intelligence and analytics: from big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012); Davenport T.H., Harris J.G., Competing on Analytics: The New Science of Winning, (2007); Futardo P., A survey of parallel and distributed data warehouses, International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining, 5, 2, pp. 57-77, (2009); Hattori H., Nakajima Y., Ishida T., Learning from humans: agent modeling with individual human behaviors, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics - Part A, 41, 1, pp. 1-9, (2011); Jacobs A., The pathologies of big data, Communications of the ACM, 52, 8, pp. 36-44, (2009); Lavalle S., Lesser E., Shockley R., Hopkins M.S., Kruschwitz N., Big data, analytics and the path from insights to value, MIT Sloan Management Review, 52, 2, pp. 21-31, (2011); Luhn H.P., A business intelligence system, IBM Journal, 2, 4, pp. 314-350, (1958); Manyika J., Chui M., Bughin J., Brown B., Dobbs R., Roxbury C., Byers A.H., Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity, (2011); Mayer-Schonberger V., Cukier K., Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think, (2013); McAfee A., Brynjolfsson E., Big data: the management revolution, Harvard Business Review, pp. 3-9, (2012); McFadden D.L., The new science of pleasure, National Bureasu of Economic Research.

Machine learning and deep learning play a critical role in developing intelligent systems for descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics for machine tools and process health monitoring. This paper reviews the opportunities and challenges of deep learning (DL) for intelligent machining and tool monitoring. The components of an intelligent monitoring framework are introduced. The main advantages and disadvantages of machine learning (ML) models are presented and compared with those of deep models. The main DL models, including autoencoders, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), were discussed, and their applications in intelligent machining and tool condition monitoring were reviewed. The opportunities of data-driven smart manufacturing approach applied to intelligent machining were discussed to be (1) automated feature engineering, (2) handling big data, (3) handling high-dimensional data, (4) avoiding sensor redundancy, (5) optimal sensor fusion, and (6) offering hybrid intelligent models. Finally, the data-driven challenges in smart manufacturing, including the challenges associated with the data size, data nature, model selection, and process uncertainty, were discussed, and the research gaps were outlined. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Data-driven manufacturing; Deep learning; Feature selection; Intelligent machining monitoring; Machine learning; Neural networks, Artificial intelligence; Smart manufacturing; Tool condition monitoring; Tool wear","Clustering algorithms; Condition monitoring; Convolutional neural networks; Flow control; Industrial research; Intelligent systems; Machine tools; Manufacture; Predictive analytics; Recurrent neural networks; Sensor data fusion; Deep belief networks; High dimensional data; Hybrid intelligent model; Intelligent machining; Intelligent monitoring; Process uncertainties; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Tool condition monitoring; Learning systems","","","","","","","Zhong R.Y., Ge W., Internet of things enabled manufacturing: a review, Int J Agile Syst Manag, 11, 2, pp. 126-154, (2018); Yang C., Shen W., Wang X., The internet of things in manufacturing: key issues and potential applications, IEEE Syst Man Cybern Mag, 4, 1, pp. 6-15, (2018); Yang C., Shen W., Wang X., Applications of Internet of Things in manufacturing, 2016 IEEE 20Th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD).

Given a set of potential suppliers, potential manufacturing facilities and distribution centers with multiple possible configurations, and customers with seasonal demands, the goal is to determine the configuration of the production-distribution system with the lowest sum of supply, production, transportation, inventory, and facility costs such that seasonal customer demands are met. We develop a mixed integer programming formulation and an integrated design methodology based on primal (Benders) decomposition. For a case study in the packaging industry, specialized acceleration techniques reduced the running times by a factor of 480.

Electrode wear ratio (EWR), material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (SR) was the three parameters observed. Discharge current, pulse on time, duty cycle and gap voltage were the controllable process variables. The effect of process variables on EWR, MRR and SR has been analyzed. The MRR, EWR and SR obtained in EDM process with normal electrode, cryogenically cooled electrode and ultrasonic assisted cryogenically cooled electrode have been compared. EWR and SR were found to be lower in UACEDM process as compared to conventional EDM for the same set of process parameters, while MRR was at par with conventional EDM process. The surface integrity of work piece machined by UACEDM process has been found to be better as compared to conventional EDM process. The shape of the electrode has also been measured and it was found that the shape retention was better in UACEDM process as compared to conventional EDM process. Thus in the present work UACEDM process has been established to be better than conventional EDM process due to better tool life, tool shape retention ability and better surface integrity. © 2012 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.","Cryogenic cooling;

However, less has been said about how such automation systems might be effectively configured and supported through their lifecycles and how application modeling, visualization, and reuse of such systems might be best achieved. It is vitally important to be able to incorporate support for engineering best practice while at the same time exploiting the potential that CPS has to offer in an automation systems setting. This paper considers the industrial context for the engineering of CPS. It reviews engineering approaches that have been proposed or adopted to date including Industry 4.0 and provides examples of engineering methods and tools that are currently available. The paper then focuses on the CPS engineering toolset being developed by the Automation Systems Group (ASG) in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. and explains via an industrial case study how such a component-based engineering toolset can support an integrated approach to the virtual and physical engineering of automation systems through their lifecycle via a method that enables multiple vendors' equipment to be effectively integrated and provides support for the specification, validation, and use of such systems across the supply chain, e.g., between end users and system integrators. © 2016 IEEE.","Automation; cyber-physical systems (CPSs); engineering; lifecycle; manufacturing; methods","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Engineering; Life cycle; Manufacture; Supply chains; Component-based engineering; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Engineering best practice; Industrial case study; Manufacturing industries; methods; University of Warwick; Warwick manufacturing groups; Automation","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/K018191/1); Innovate UK","This work was supported by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), through the Knowledge-Driven Configurable Manufacturing (KDCM) research project under the Flexible and Reconfigurable Manufacturing Initiative, from Innovate UK on the Direct Digital Deployment project, and from ARTEMIS on the Arrowhead project.","Lee E., Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, Proc. 11th IEEE Int.

Its objective is to minimize the total relevant costs while meeting non-constant, time varying demand, assuming fixed sales and production capacity. Despite numerous and varied solution techniques few have been implemented in industry. One problem with their implementation could be that little literature exists, outside of cursory textbook presentations and state-of-the-art summaries in 1967 and 1972 by Silver, which specifically summarizes the existing APP techniques into a simple classification scheme. In this paper we present a classification scheme that categorizes the literature on APP since early 1950, summarizing the various existing techniques into a framework depending upon their ability to either produce an exact optimal or near-optimal solution. The research literature that we compiled consisted of 140 journal articles and 14 books. The articles came from 17 different journals. It is intended to facilitate practitioners and researchers in finding the source work for existing methodologies, and to assist them in determining the suitability for implementation to their particular manufacturing problem and also to identify those areas that might require additional investigation and research. © 1992.","Aggregate production planning; cost minimization; optimal solutions, near-optimal solutions; production rate; state-of-the-art review; work force level","Classification (of information); Cost Accounting; Inventory Control; Job Analysis; Operations Research; Production Engineering; Aggregate Production Planning; Cost Minimization; Near Optimal Solutions; Optimal Solutions; Production Rate; State of the Art Review; Work Force Level; Industrial Engineering","","","","","","","Akinc, Roodman, A new approach to aggregate production planning, IIE Transactions, 18, pp. 88-94, (1986); Armacost, Penlesky, Ross, Avoiding problems inherent in spreadsheet-based simulation models: An aggregate planning application, Journal of Production and Inventory Management, 31, pp. 62-67, (1990); Axsater, Coordinating control of production-inventory systems, International Journal of Production Research, 14, pp. 669-688, (1976); Axsater, Aggregation of product data for hierarchical production planning, Operations Research, 29, pp. 744-756, (1981); Axsater, On the feasibility of aggregate production plans, Operations Research, 34, pp. 796-800, (1986); Axsater, Jonsson, Aggregation and disaggregation in hierarchical production planning, European Journal of Operational Research, 17, pp. 338-350, (1984); Baker, AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ROLLING SCHEDULES IN PRODUCTION PLANNING, Decision Sciences, 8, pp. 19-27, (1977); Baker, Dixon, Magazine, Silver, An algorithm for the dynamic lot-size problem with time-varying production capacity constraints, Management Science, 24, pp. 1710-1720, (1978); Balinski, Fixed-cost transportation problems, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 8, pp. 41-45, (1961); Barman, Burch, The production switching heuristic: A practical revision, International Journal of Production Research, 27, pp. 1803-1875, (1989); Beckmann, Production Smoothing and Inventory Control, Operations Research, 9, pp. 456-467, (1961); Bedworth, Bailey, Integrated Production Control Systems: Management, Analysis, Design, (1982); Behnezhad, Khoshnevis, The effects of manufacturing progress function on machine requirements and aggregate planning problems, International Journal of Production Research, 20, pp. 309-325, (1982); Bergstrom, Smith, Multi-Item Production Planning—An Extension of the HMMS Rules, Management Science, 16, pp. B614-B629, (1970); Bishop, On a Problem of Production Scheduling, Operations Research, 5, pp. 97-108, (1957); Bitran, Haas, Hax, Hierarchical production planning: A single-stage system, Operations Research, 29, pp. 717-743, (1981); Bitran, Haas, Hax, Hierarchical production planning: A two-stage system, Operations Research, 30, pp. 232-251, (1982); Bitran, Hax, ON THE DESIGN OF HIERARCHICAL PRODUCTION PLANNING SYSTEMS, Decision Sciences, 8, pp. 28-55, (1977); Bitran, Hax, Disaggregation and resource allocation using convex knapsack problems with bounded variables, Management Science, 27, pp. 431-441, (1981); Bowman, Production Scheduling by the Transportation Method of Linear Programming, Operations Research, 4, pp. 100-103, (1956); Bowman, Consistency and Optimality in Managerial Decision Making, Management Science, 9, pp. 310-321, (1963); Buffa, Taubert, Evaluation of direct computer search methods for the aggregate planning problem, Industrial Management Review, pp. 19-28, (1967); Buffa, Taubert, Production-Inventory Systems: Planning and Control, (1972); Chang, Jones, Production and Workforce Scheduling Extensions, A I I E Transactions, 2, pp. 326-333, (1970); Charnes, Cooper, Mellon, A Model for Optimizing Production by Reference to Cost Surrogates, Econometrica, 23, pp. 307-323, (1955); Close, A simplified planning scheme for the manufacturer with seasonal demand, Journal of Industrial Engineering, 19, pp. 454-462, (1968); Coker, Analyzing production switching heuristics for aggregate planning models via a application, Prod. & Inven.

Despite such promising market sentiment, the battery system management remains as a challenging issue to be resolved in order to provide a safe and reliable power and energy storage system. Here we report advancement in the battery management approach by providing a solution to analyze battery performance variations in a lot of batteries produced from the same manufacturing process. A lot of 100 Li-ion cells were analyzed in order to quantify the inherent cell variations associated with cell manufacturing process and test protocol. Both statistical and electrochemical analyses were used to characterize and quantify the capacity variations among the cells along with other parameters that can be readily derived from the test results. Information extracted from a minimal testing of the cells in the lot and more intensive characterizations on a few cells including one as the nominal sample cell allows the establishment of a single cell model (SCM), based on a generic equivalent circuit, with high accuracy in predicting cell performance. The analyses also permit a carefully crafted logic development of how to separate the origins that cause the cell variations in performance. Such separation of the attributes enable a proper tuning of the cell parameters in the model, which allows the accommodation of cell variations in a battery pack model to handle most of the imbalance issues. A careful validation of the SCM to predict performance of any arbitrary cell in the lot with high accuracy was demonstrated. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Battery pack; Battery pack management; Equivalent circuit model; Intrinsic cell imbalance; Statistical analysis","Cells; Circuit theory; Cytology; Electronics industry; Energy storage; Flywheels; Industrial engineering; Lithium batteries; Power electronics; Production engineering; Renewable energy resources; Statistical methods; Battery pack; Equivalent circuit model; Intrinsic cell imbalance; Statistical analysis; Bioinformatics","","","","","","","Newman J., Electrochemical Systems, (1991); Barsoukov E., Kim J.H., Kim J.H., Yoon C.O., Lee H., Kinetics of lithium intercalation into carbon anodes: in situ impedance investigation of thickness and potential dependence, Solid State Ionics, 116, pp. 249-261, (1999); Fellner C., Newman J., High-power batteries for use in hybrid vehicles, Journal of Power Sources, 85, pp. 229-236, (2000); Wu B., Mohammed M., Brigham D., Elder R., White R.E., A non-isothermal model of a nickel-metal hydride cell, Journal of Power Sources, 101, pp. 149-157, (2001); Plett G.L., Sigma-point Kalman filtering for battery management systems of LiPB-based HEV battery packs.

This paper investigates business model innovation for circular supply chains, and proposes that product-service systems (PSS) business models can enhance the circularity of supply chains through value creation in inner circles, circling long and cascading use circles. It adopts an exploratory case study method of a large Chinese manufacturing firm operating a traditional product-based business model and three types of PSS business models (i.e. product-, use- and result-oriented PSSs). The supply chain operations of the four distinct business models are analysed and their associated circularities are discussed. The findings show that business models akin to result-oriented PSS, have tighter and more efficient cycles of supply chain operations; which means, the repair, reuse and remanufacturing system is faster and the rate is higher. This research contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between business model innovation and supply chain circularity. © 2018 The Author(s).

A texture parameter is defined which quantifies the density of {100} easy magnetic directions in the sheet planes. An extensive correlation study revealed the relation of this parameter with the hysteresis losses, determined at an induction of 1.5 T, and with the induction measured at an applied external field of 25 A/cm. It is shown that the latter magnetic property is the more texture dependent, whereas the former one is more sensitive to the grain size of the steel. Also various strategies for texture control are critically reviewed. It is shown that the conventional manufacturing process only provides poor tools for optimizing the texture of the final product. In order to obtain a quantum-leap improvement of the magnetic quality of the texture, in combination with other important microstructural features, nonstandard processing strategies are required, such as cross-rolling, two-stage cold rolling, or surface annealing.

Also, 3D IC technology can be used to realize heterogeneous system-on-chip design, by integrating different modules together with less interference with each other. In this paper, we propose a novel thermal-aware 3D cell placement approach, named T3Place, based on transforming a 2D placement with good wirelength to a 3D placement, with the objectives of half-perimeter wirelength, through-the-silicon (TS) via number and temperature. T3Place is composed of two steps, transformation from a 2D placement to a 3D placement and the refinement of the resulting 3D placement. We proposed and compared several different transformation techniques, including local stacking transformation (LST), folding-2, folding-4 and window-based stacking/folding transformation, and concluded that (i) LST can generate 3D placements with the least wirelength, (ii) the folding-based transformations result in 3D placements with the fewest TS vias, and (iii) the window-based stacking/folding transformations provide good TS via number and wirelength tradeoffs. For example, with four device layers, LST can reduce the wirelength by over 2× compared to the initial 2D placement, while window-based stacking/folding can provide over 10× variation in terms of the TS via number, thus adaptive to different manufacturing ability for TS via density. Moreover, we proposed a novel relaxed conflict-net (RCN) graph-based layer assignment method to further refine the 3D placements. Compared to LST results, thermal-aware RCN graph-based layer assignment algorithm (r = 10%) can further reduce the maximum on-chip temperature by 37%, with only 6% TS via number increase and 8% wirelength increase. © 2007 IEEE.","","Application specific integrated circuits; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospherics; Computer aided design; Digital integrated circuits; Graph theory; Industrial engineering; Integrated circuits; Mechanization; Microprocessor chips; Space time adaptive processing; Windows; (100) silicon; Cell placement; circuit performances; Design automation conference (DAC); device layers; Graph-based; Half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL); Heterogeneous (hybrid) systems; IC technologies; Ion chromatography (IC) technology; layer assignment; Lower-power consumption; Manufacturing ability; On chip temperature; South Pacific; transformation techniques; Window-based; Wire lengths; Mathematical transformations","","","","","","","Banerjee K., Thermal Effects in Deep Submicron VLSI Interconnects, IEEE Int.

Although chromatography remains an indispensible component of downstream processing due to its simplicity and high resolving power (The Good), there is virtually no economy of scale effect so more product translates almost linearly into greater production costs. Bind-and-elute processes (such as the initial capture step in antibody manufacturing) are volume-driven and therefore have knock-on effects that impact on the entire production facility since the space required for preparation, storage, and cleaning steps has to be similarly adapted (The Bad). During long-term operations with multiple cycles, thorough cleaning is necessary to prevent progressive fouling and microbial contamination (The Ugly). Innovative solutions are required, which may include revisiting simpler and less expensive separation technologies, the use of disposable modules, and the integration of improved processes that are scalable to cope with increased demands. Among the alternatives that have been put forward, membrane adsorbers are beginning to make a real impact on the industry, particularly for flow-through applications such as polishing and viral clearance. © 2008 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","","Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biotechnology; Centrifugation; Chemical Fractionation; Chromatography, Affinity; Drug Contamination; Drug Industry; Fractional Precipitation; Membranes, Artificial; Ultrafiltration; Adsorption; Chemicals; Chromatographic analysis; Computer networks; Contamination; Data storage equipment; Digital signal processing; Engineers; Fouling; Industrial engineering; Industry; Photoacoustic effect; Scale (deposits); Separation; Technology; monoclonal antibody; affinity chromatography; artificial membrane; biotechnology; centrifugation; conference paper; drug contamination; drug industry; fractionation; isolation and purification; methodology; precipitation; ultrafiltration; American Chemical Society (ACS); American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); Antibody manufacturing; Bio-separation; Biomanufacturing; Current technologies; Downstream processing; Economy of scale; Flow through; Innovative solutions; membrane adsorbers; Microbial contaminations; Production costs.; production facilities; separation technologies; Viral clearance; Throughput","","Antibodies, Monoclonal, ; Membranes, Artificial, ","","","","","Wurm F., Production of recombinant protein therapeutics in cultivated mammalian cells, Nat.

In this current work copper-manganese sulphides precipitates are the primary inhibitor species in the conventional grain-oriented (CGO) steels examined and grain boundary pinning is effective at a mean precipitate size of 30-70 nm. The growth of CuMnS has been studied and the results show that a precipitate size above ∼100 nm allows the onset of secondary recrystallisation in the heating conditions applied. The effect of precipitates on the magnetic properties of both grain-oriented and non-oriented steels in their final product form is then examined. Examples of grain-oriented material still containing large numbers of precipitates clearly show the detrimental effects with increases in total power loss of 40% or more. Loss deterioration by about 20% is also seen in samples of high silicon non-oriented material in which titanium carbo-nitride precipitates have been observed. In this case the precipitates are believed to have formed during cooling after final annealing. Finally a grain-oriented steel with a large number of very small precipitates, which do not seem to have any harmful effect on the magnetic properties, is demonstrated. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental results have shown that ultrasonic welding is a combination of both surface (friction) and volume (plasticity) softening effects. In the presented work, a very first attempt has been made to simulate the ultrasonic welding of metals by taking into account both of these effects (surface and volume). A phenomenological material model has been proposed which incorporates these two effects (i.e. surface and volume). The thermal softening due to friction and ultrasonic (acoustic) softening has been included in the proposed material model. For surface effects a friction law with variable coefficient of friction dependent upon contact pressure, slip, temperature and number of cycles has been derived from experimental friction tests. Thermomechanical analyses of ultrasonic welding of aluminium alloy have been performed. The effects of ultrasonic welding process parameters, such as applied load, amplitude of ultrasonic vibration, and velocity of welding sonotrode on the friction work at the weld interface are being analyzed. The change in the friction work at the weld interface has been explained on the basis of softening (thermal and acoustic) of the specimen during the ultrasonic welding process. In the end, a comparison between experimental and simulated results has been presented showing a good agreement. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Each single step along the processing pipeline that prepares the 3D model for fabrication can now count on dozens of methods, that analyse and optimize geometry and machine instructions for various objectives. This report provides a classification of this huge state of the art, and elicits the relation between each single algorithm and a list of desirable objectives during model preparation – a process globally refereed to as Process Planning. The objectives themselves are listed and discussed, along with possible needs for tradeoffs. Additive Manufacturing technologies are broadly categorized to explicitly relate classes of devices and supported features. Finally, this report offers an analysis of the state of the art while discussing open and challenging problems from both an academic and an industrial perspective. © 2017 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The Multi-Agent System (MAS) paradigm offers an alternative way to design this kind of system based on decentralized control using distributed, autonomous agents, thus replacing the traditional centralized control approach. The MAS solutions provide modularity, flexibility and robustness, thus addressing the responsiveness property, but usually do not consider true adaptation and re-configuration. Understanding how, in nature, complex things are performed in a simple and effective way allows us to mimic natures insights and develop powerful adaptive systems that able to evolve, thus dealing with the current challenges imposed on manufacturing systems. The paper provides an overview of some of the principles found in nature and biology and analyses the effectiveness of bio-inspired methods, which are used to enhance multi-agent systems to solve complex engineering problems, especially in the manufacturing field. An industrial automation case study is used to illustrate a bio-inspired method based on potential fields to dynamically route pallets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

What will the implications of these orchestrated and ubiquitous technologies in production – a concept we call Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) – be on the health, learning and operative performance of human workers? This paper makes three main contributions to address the question. First, it synthesizes the diverse literature regarding CPS and social sustainability in production systems. Second, it conceptualizes a holistic framework, the CyFL Matrix, and outlines a guideline to analyze how the functionalities of a CPPS relate to operational and social sustainability-related performance impacts at different levels of analysis. Finally, it presents an industrial use case, which the CyFL Matrix and the related guidelines are applied to. In doing so, the study offers first support to researchers and managers of manufacturing companies willing to define suitable operational and social sustainability-related performances for Human-centric Cyber-Physical Production Systems of the future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber-Physical Production System; Functionality; Human; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Performance; Social sustainability","Embedded systems; Engineering education; Industry 4.0; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Functionality; Human; Performance; Production system; Social sustainability; Cyber Physical System","","","","","Whirlpool EMEA; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (680633)","Funding text 1: The Authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the seven Experts for their valuable insights and advice.

The synthesis approach attempts to arrive at a theory relevant for service and manufacturing. Gallouj and Weinstein [Gallouj, F., Weinstein, O., 1997. Innovation in services. Research Policy 26, 537-556] were one of the first to take this approach. This article contributes to the synthesis approach by revising their theory to enable reasoning about recent innovation trends in networks of organizations and in the distribution of services. The theory revision is based on several case studies. Implications for the study of innovation are discussed in terms of results from recent demarcation studies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Box 513, Netherlands","Manufacturing research has been focused on point solutions and technology-driven solutions. These have not delivered the step changes in performance needed, nor have they been adopted by wide sections of industry so the total business benefit resulting has been modest. The authors propose that manufacturing research must now place greater emphasis on total manufacturing business systems development. Coupled with the integration and communication technologies now becoming available this is the best way to enable manufacturers to realise the competitive gain demanded by the market place. The primary pressures to which manufacturing will be subject are detailed. These are encapsulated in the concept of customer-driven manufacturing business systems. In these systems the customer increasingly becomes an integrated part of both the business systems and the engineering systems of the enterprise. Key product and process technological advances, environmental, and market place developments are described. Probably most significant are the changes in the value chain now emerging which transform manufacturing business systems and overturn both conventional manufacturing strategy and existing manufacturing metrics. The institutionalisation of the Extended Enterprise is one of the most tangible and has far reaching outcomes. This will involve major structural changes in business organisation. The basis of partnership within the Extended Enterprise is not yet well understood but alternative operations models are likely to be industry and market sector specific. Concurrent Engineering is becoming accepted but understanding of best practice on how, when and in what order to implement it is needed. The extension of tools to embrace environmental issues could offer significant benefit to small and medium sized enterprises. The appraisal of manufacturing business options must be developed to match the changes in the business operations environment described above. © 1995.","Extended Enterprise; Manufacturing system research","Concurrent engineering; Industrial research; Marketing; Operations research; Process engineering; Systems engineering; Customer driven manufacturing business systems; Engineering systems; Extended enterprise; Institutionalisation; Manufacturing system research; Market place development; Partnership; Value chain; Manufacture","","","","","","","Skinner, Manufacturing—Missing link in corporate strategy, Harv.

These emissions may be strongly influenced by the raw materials and manufacturing techniques of the panels. However, there is very little published information regarding this issue. In this study we determine and compare formaldehyde and VOC emissions, including their species and content, at different manufacturing stages of wood-based panels such as urea-formaldehyde resin, wood chip, wood fiber after resin application, medium density fiberboard, and phenol-formaldehyde resin. We found that: (1) in total, 34 individual VOCs were identified, but none of them were in all the specimens, indicating considerable VOC species changes during the manufacturing process; (2) the formaldehyde in wood-based panels came primarily from urea-formaldehyde resin, and there existed a linear relationship between the formaldehyde content in resins and formaldehyde specific emission rate from wood-base panels; (3) VOCs in wood-based panels mainly came from the wood chips; (4) the drying and hot-pressing techniques were helpful in reducing the formaldehyde and VOC emissions from wood-based panels. Some suggestions are presented for the control of formaldehyde and VOC emissions from wood-based panels during the manufacturing process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Formaldehyde; Phenol-formaldehyde resin; Urea-formaldehyde resin; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs); Wood-based panels","Air Quality; Chips; Formaldehyde; Manufacture; Metabolism; Phenols; Polyureas; Production Engineering; Voc; Wood Fibers; Wood Products; Air quality; Formaldehyde; Indoor air pollution; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Metabolism; Phenolic resins; Phenols; Production engineering; Synthetic resins; Urea; Volatile organic compounds; Wood products; Emission rates; Indoor air quality; Linear relationships; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing stages; Manufacturing techniques; Medium density fiberboards; Phenol-formaldehyde resin; VOC emissions; Wood chip; Wood fiber; Wood-based panels; air quality; emission; formaldehyde; indoor air; phenol; resin; urea; volatile organic compound; Urea formaldehyde resins","","","","","National Natural Science Funds, (50725620); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission","This study was supported by National Natural Science Funds (grant no. 50725620 ) and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Projects (grant no.

Design/methodology/approach From a contingency theory perspective, a survey of 107 Canadian manufacturers was used to collect data that were analyzed through correlation analysis. Findings Results indicate that the ideal e-business profiles vary in the relation to the firms' strategic orientation, whether it is of the defender, analyzer or prospector type. E-business alignment has positive performance outcomes for manufacturing SMEs in terms of growth, productivity and financial performance. Research limitations/implications The nature of the sample impose care in generalizing the results of the study. These results also allow us to emphasise the nature rather than the investment value of the SMEs' information technology investment, given that certain forms of e-business would be more appropriate for certain firms, depending upon their strategic orientation. Practical implications For SME owner-managers that require greater manufacturing flexibility, increased systems integration, products and services of better quality, and higher levels of product and process innovation, the results of this study allow us to prone an examination of their firm's level of e-business assimilation, this being done in conjunction with their strategic intent. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to have used a rigorous conceptualisation and measure of alignment to confirm the theoretical validity and empirical usefulness of this notion and of the strategic contingency approach for research on e-business, and to compare this approach with the universalistic approach founded upon “best practices”. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business performance;

The demand for light-weight products with high strength has grown recently due to the rapid development of automobile and aircraft technology. One key to such development has been utilization of magnesium alloys, which can potentially reduce the total product weight. However, the problems of utilizing magnesium alloys are still mainly related to high manufacturing cost. One of the solutions to this problem is to develop magnesium casting-rolling technology in order to produce magnesium sheet products at competitive cost for commercial applications. In this experiment, magnesium alloys AZ31B, AZ91D, AM50A and AM60B were used for twin-roll strip casting. Temperature of the molten materials and roll speeds of upper and lower rolls, which could be adjusted independently, were varied to find appropriate manufacturing conditions. Effects of cooling and contact condition on possible forming were clarified in terms of contact condition between molten material and the rolls. Microscopic observation of the crystals of the finished casting was performed. It has been found that 2.0-3.0 mm thick magnesium sheets could be produced at a speed of 25 m/min. It has been found that the hot rolled cast magnesium sheets produced by semi-solid manufacturing process could be used for plastic forming. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In different regions, initiatives in these directions are known under different names, such as industrie du futur in France, industrial internet in the US or Industrie 4.0 in Germany. While the vision of digitizing production and manufacturing gained much traction lately, it is still relatively unclear howthis vision can actually be implemented with concrete standardsand technologies. Within the German Industry 4.0 initiative, the concept of an Administrative Shell was devised to respond to these requirements. The Administrative Shell is planned to provide a digital representation of all information being available about and from an object which can be a hardware system or a software platform. In this paper, we present an approach to develop such a digital re presentation based on semantic knowledge representation formalisms such as RDF, RDF Schema and OWL. We present our concept of a Semantic I4.0 Component whichaddresses the communication and comprehension challenges in Industry 4.0 scenarios using semantic technologies.

These measurements can be performed with a variety of instruments which have different capabilities and limitations. In this paper we present a wide variety of instruments that are used for measuring surface topography using optical techniques. These range from systems that are over a century old to recently-developed instrumentation that has broad new capability. We have, insofar as possible, tried to cover all of the instruments used in the visible region; however, considering the plethora of techniques and papers discovered, some omission is certainly possible.","Measuring Instrument; Optical; Surface","Industrial engineering; Optical engineering; Optical instruments; Optical variables measurement; Process control; Measuring Instrument; Optical; Optical techniques; Surface; Surface topography","","","","","","","Schwenke H., Neuschaefer-Rube U., Pfeifer T., Kunzmann H., Optical methods for dimensional metrology in production engineering, Annals of the CIRP, 51, 2, (2002); Gasvik K.J., Optical Metrology, (2002); Peters J., Et al., Contribution of CIRP to the development of metrology and surface quality evaluation during the last fifty years, Annals of the CIRP, 50, 2, pp. 471-488, (2001); Evans C., Precision Engineering: An Evolutionary View, (1989); De Chiffre L., Kunzmann H., Peggs G.N., Lucca D.A., Surfaces in precision engineering, microengineering and nanotechnology, Annals of the CIRP, 52, 2, pp. 561-576, (2003); Lucca D.A., Brinksmeier E., Goch G., Progress in assessing surface and subsurface integrity, Annals of the CIRP, 47, 2, pp. 669-693, (1998); Geometrical Product Specification (GPS), Surface Texture: Profile Method - Rules and Procedures for the Assessment of Surface Texture, (1996); Evans C.J., Bryan J.B., Structured, textured"" or ""engineered"" surfaces, Annals of the CIRP, 48, 2, pp. 541-556, (1999); Teague E.C., Vorburger T.V., Maystre D., Light scattering from manufactured surfaces, Annals of the CIRP, 30, 2, pp. 563-569, (1981); Vorburger T.V., Orji N.G., Sung L.P., Rodriguez T., Surface finish and sub-surface metrology, Proc.

Augmented reality (AR) market is increasing but still its adoption levels are low in industry. While companies strive to learn and adopt AR, there are chances that they fail in such endeavours due to lack of understanding key challenges and success factors in this space. This study identifies critical success factors and challenges for IAR implementation projects based on field experiments. The broadly used technology, organisation, environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical basis for the study, while 22 experiments were conducted for validation. It is found that, while technological aspects are of importance, organisational issues are more relevant for industry, which has not been reflected to the same extent in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Augmented reality; Challenges; Critical success factors; Digital; Environment; Implementation; Industrial experiments; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Organisation; Technology; TOE","Engineering; Industry; Industry 4.0; Manufacture; Challenges; Critical success factor; Digital; Environment; Implementation; Industrial experiments; Organisation; Augmented reality","","","","","University of Cambridge","The authors are most grateful to the industry colleagues (from Beckhoff Automation, Herman Miller and fluiconnecto) and University of Cambridge students for their in-kind support (in terms of their time and providing access to the premises) for conducting the 22 experiments in total.

For spot welds made with a cylindrical pin tool with flat shoulder, the model predicts the material flow at the pin periphery to be in the upward direction and the material is pushed downward beneath the shoulder giving rise to the resultant hook geometry. Other pin geometries evaluated include tapered pin, inverse tapered pin, triangular pin, convex shoulder, and concave shoulder. With good correlation with experimental trials, this model is then used to predict the material flow for spot welds. The material flow, and thereby the resultant hook formation, is quantified using numerical methods and is expressed as standard deviation of the particle movement. A triangular pin with a concave shoulder is the preferred tool geometry from the current study that results in high strength spot welds. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Friction stir spot welding; Manufacturing process simulation;

Design/methodology/approach - First, a general schematic is defined that enables description of all currently available AM machines. This schematic is used to define two influential factors describing certain parts' properties regarding the machines' yield during manufacturing. A test part is defined, that will enable testing the influence of these factors on the speed and accuracy of manufacturing. A method for implementing and adapting test parts is established for individual machine's testing. This method was used to test four different machines that are predominantly used in Slovenia at the moment. Findings - Research has proven that the machine's yield had a predominant influence on the achievable manufacturing speeds of all the tested machines. In addition, the results have shown different ranges of achievable manufacturing speeds for individually tested machines. Test parts' measurement results have shown comparable achievable accuracies for all the tested machines. Research limitations/ implications - Speed evaluation is based on a 2k factorial design that assumes the linearity among individual points of the experiment. This design was chosen to keep the method as simple and quick as possible, in order to perform testing on those machines otherwise used in industrial environments. Accuracy evaluation was limited by a rather small sample size of ten fabricated test parts per machine. Practical implications - The presented evaluation method can be used on any existing or future type of AM machine, and their comparative placement regarding achievable manufacturing speed and accuracy.

WM relies substantially on wireless devices (e.g. RFID-Radio Frequency Identification or Auto ID-Automatic Identification, and on wireless information/communication networks (e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), for the collection and synchronization of manufacturing data. This paper proposes a WM framework where RFID devices are deployed to workstations, critical tools, key components, and containers of WIP (Work In Progress) materials to turn them into so-called smart objects. The study is based on a simplified product assembly line. Smart objects are tracked and traced and shop-floor disturbances are detected and fed back to decision makers on a real-time basis. Such real-time visibility closes the loop of adaptive assembly planning and control. A facility called assembly line explorer is provided for the line manager to oversee the status of the entire assembly line, and a workstation explorer facility for operators to monitor the status of their operations at corresponding workstations. These facilities improve the effectiveness of managerial decisions and operational efficiency. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Assembly planning and scheduling; Enterprise data synchronization; Manufacturing execution system; RFID/auto ID; Smart objects; Wireless manufacturing","Assembly machines; Automation; Cellular telephone systems; Electronic data interchange; Identification (control systems); Industrial engineering; Manufacture; Network protocols; Paper containers; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Sensor networks; Wireless networks; Assembly planning and scheduling; Enterprise data synchronization; Manufacturing execution system; RFID/auto ID; Smart objects; Wireless manufacturing; Assembly","","","","","863, (2006AA042132); GDNSF, (05200197); HKU Seed Fund for Applied Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (70629002, GHP/015/06, GHP/042/07); University of Hong Kong, HKU","Acknowledgements Authors would like to acknowledge financial supports various companies, HKU Teaching Development Grants (TGD), HKU Seed Fund for Applied Research, National Science Foundation of China (70629002), HKSAR ITF (GHP/015/06, GHP/042/07), 863 (2006AA042132) and GDNSF (05200197)","Agnetis A., Nicolo F., Arbib C., Lucertini M., Task assignment and subassembly scheduling in flexible assembly lines, IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 11, pp. 1-20, (1995); Angeles R., RFID Technologies: Supply-Chain Applications and Implementation Issues, Information Systems Management, 22, pp. 51-65, (2005); Anwar M.F., Nagi R., Integrated lot-sizing and scheduling for just-in-time production of complex assemblies with finite set-ups, International Journal of Production Research, 35, pp. 1447-1470, (1997); Brewer A., Sloan N., Landers T., Intelligent tracking in manufacturing, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 10, pp. 245-250, (1999); Brock D., White Paper: The Compact Electronic Product Code (EPC), (2001); Brock D., White Paper: The Electronic Product Code (EPC), (2001); Chappell G., Durdan D.G., Gibert G.L., Ginsburg J.S., Tobolski J., White Paper: The Electronic Product Code (EPC), (2002); Chappell G., Ginsburg L., Schmidt P., Smith J., Tobolski J., White Paper: The Electronic Product Code (EPC), (2003); Cheng F.-T., Shen E., Deng J.-Y., Nguyen K., Development of a distributed object-oriented system framework for the computer-integrated manufacturing execution system, ICRA, 1998, pp. 2116-2121, (1998); Chu B., Long J., Tolone W.J., Wilhelm R., Peng Y., Finin T., Et al., Towards intelligent integrated planning-execution, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Systems, 1, pp. 77-83, (1997); Ding Y., Kim P., Ceglarek D., Jin J., Optimal sensor distribution for variation diagnosis in multistation assembly processes, IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 19, pp. 543-556, (2003); Fitzek F.H.P., Angelini D., Mazzini G., Zorzi M., Design and performance of an enhanced IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol for multichip coverage extension, Wireless Communications, IEEE, 10, pp. 30-39, (2003); Floerkemeier C., Anarkat D., Osinski T., Harrison M., Whitepaper: PML Core Specification 1.0, (2004); Huang G.Q., Zhang Y.F., Jiang P.Y., RFID-based wireless manufacturing for walking-worker assembly shops with fixed-position layouts, International Journal of Robotics and Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 23, pp. 469-477, (2007); Johnson D., RFID tags improve tracking, quality on Ford line in Mexico, Control Engineering, 49, pp. 16-16, (2002); Karkkainen M., Holmstrom J., Wireless product identification: Enabler for handling efficiency, customization and information sharing, Supply China Management, 7, pp. 242-252, (2002); Kiritsis D., Ubiquitous Product Lifecycle Management Using Product Embedded Information Devices, (2004); Kivikoskil M., Radio frequency technology for automated manufacturing and logistics control.

Such a machine is often referred to as modular and offers a number of significant advantages over conventional PM brushless machines. For example, it results in a smaller number of slots for a given number of poles, which is a distinctmanufacturing advantage, and yields a fractional number of slots per pole, which is conducive to low cogging torque. It also enables a significant increase in the achievable machine inductance to facilitate constant power operation over a wide speed range by flux weakening. However, the torque in modular machines is developed by the interaction of a high-order stator space harmonic MMF with the PMs, since the fundamental stator MMF has fewer poles than the PM rotor. Hence, significant eddy currents may be induced in the rotor by the fundamental and low-order space harmonic MMFs. The eddy-current loss can, however, be reduced by segmenting the magnets. Given that modular machines combine the high specific power and efficiency of conventional PM brushless machines with a high machine inductance, to enable a wide speed range, constant power operation, their potential for low manufacturing cost, and the fact that they have inherently low cogging torque, they are eminently suitable for in-wheel traction applications. © 2008 IEEE.","Electric and hybrid vehicles; Electric traction drives; Permanent-magnet (PM) machine","Dentistry; Eddy currents; Inductance; Industrial engineering; Magnets; Poles; Powder metallurgy; Speed; Stators; Torque; Wheels; AC machines; Brushless machines; Cogging torque; Constant power; Eddy-current losses; Electric and hybrid vehicles; Electric traction drives; Flux weakening; High-order; In-wheel; Low manufacturing cost; Modular machines; Permanent-magnet (PM) machine; Space harmonics; Specific power; Wide speed range; Permanent magnets","","","","","","","Ishak D., Zhu Z.Q., Howe D., Unbalanced magnetic forces in permanent magnet brushless machines with diametrically asymmetric phase windings, Conf.

Until recently, limited availability of HMOs has prevented their use in infant nutrition and impeded research into their biological effects. The shift from chemical synthesis to biotechnological manufacturing has made them accessible in quantities and at prices that are within reach for commercial applications, including infant formula. It accelerated the studies in the field of pre-clinical and clinical HMO biology. This review gives a short overview of HMO manufacturing from the design and optimization of the microbial cell factory and the production of HMOs in the industrial fermentation process to the purification in the downstream process necessary to obtain a final product. Moreover, the transition from chemistry to biotechnology and the current regulatory landscape and commercialization progress are briefly reviewed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","","Bacteria; Biotechnology; Cell Engineering;

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical data was drawn from 122 ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturing organizations in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using correlation and multiple regression analyses. Findings: The findings revealed that TQM practices were found to be partially correlated with quality performance of the Malaysian ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturing organizations. It is also found that where customer focus and continual improvement were perceived as dominant TQM practices in quality performance. Research limitations/implications - This research paper was limited by excluding non-ISO 9001:2000 certified organizations in the selection of manufacturing firms in Malaysia, making this a possibly biased selection, which might not adequately represent the Malaysian perspective on the entire Malaysia's manufacturing industry. Originality/value: The outcome of the study could provide valuable knowledge to top management of ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturing organizations to refine their quality management practices and subsequently improve quality performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","ISO 9000 series; Malaysia; Quality management; Total quality management","Industrial research; Management; Manufacture; Quality assurance; Quality control; Regression analysis; Research; Total quality management; Tropical engineering; Customer focussed; Design/methodology/approach; Empirical datum; ISO 9000 series; ISO 9001:2000; Malaysia; Malaysian; Management performances; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing organizations; Multiple regressions; Quality management practices; Quality performances; Research papers; Special emphases; Top managements; Quality management","","","","","","","Adam E.E., Corbett M.L., Flores E.B., Harrison J.N., Lee T.S., Rho B.H., Ribera J., Samson D., Westbrook R., An international study of quality management approach and firm performance, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 17, 9, pp. 842-73, (1997); Ahire S.L., Golear D.Y., Waller M.W., Development and validation of TQM implementation contructs, Decision Sciences, 27, 1, pp. 23-56, (1996); Anderson C.J., Rungtusanatham M., Schroeder G.R., Devaraj S., A path analytic model of a theory of quality management method: Preliminary empirical findings, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 637-58, (1995); Benson P.G., Saraph V.J., Schroeder G.R., The effects organizational context on quality management: An empirical investigation, Management Science, 37, 9, pp. 1107-24, (1991); Brah S.A., Tee S.S.L., Relationship between TQM and performance of Singapore companies, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 19, 4, pp. 356-79, (2002); Dale B.G., Managing Quality, (1999); Jr W.D.J., Bowen D.E., Management theory and total quality: Improving research and practice through theory development, Academy of Management Review, 19, 3, pp. 392-418, (1994); Prize D., Guide for Overseas Companies, (1992); Dunk S.A., Product quality, environmental accounting and quality performance, Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal, 15, 5, pp. 719-34, (2002); Quality Award E., Self-assessment Based on the European Model for Total Quality Management: Guidelines for Identifying and Addressing Business Excellence Issues, (1994); Flynn B.B., Schroeder R., Sakakibara S., A framework for quality management research and an associated measurement instrument, Journal of Operations Management, 11, pp. 339-66, (1994); Flynn B.B., Schroeder R., Sakakibara S., The impact of quality management practices on performance and competitive advantage, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 659-92, (1995); Fryer K.J., Anthony J., Douglas A., Critical success factors of continuous improvement in the public sector: A literature review and some key findings, The TQM Magazine, 19, 5, pp. 497-517, (2007); Hair J.F., Anderson R.E., Tatham R.L., Blank W.C., Multivariate Data Analysis, (1998); Ho S.K.M., Fung C.K.H., Developing a TQM excellence model, TQM Magazine, 6, 6, pp. 24-30, (1994); Hoang D.T., Igel B., Laosirihongthong T., The impact of total quality management on innovation: Findings from a developing country, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 23, 9, pp. 1092-116, (2006); Igbaria M., Iivari J., Maragahh H., Why do individuals use computer technology?

Consequently, worker learning and retention is becoming an increasingly important factor in manufacturing productivity. With the enormous increase in the volume and quality of low level data that are collected from bar code readers and automated acquisition devices, we have the opportunity to obtain detailed empirical knowledge about the learning and forgetting process. A population based approach to measuring workforce learning and retention forgetting is described through empirical industrial examples that include a manual task and a procedural task. Results provide management with the means for effective worker allocation. We present several empirical results including the result that workers who learn more rapidly also tend to forget more rapidly for both the manual and the procedural tasks.

Such principles are also applied in shipbuilding, which usually involves numerous complex processes whose automation will improve its efficiency and performance. Navantia, a company that has been building ships for 300 years, is modernizing its shipyards according to the Industry 4.0 principles with the help of the latest technologies. Augmented reality (AR), which when utilized in an industrial environment is called industrial AR (IAR), is one of such technologies, since it can be applied in numerous situations in order to provide useful and attractive interfaces that allow shipyard operators to obtain information on their tasks and to interact with certain elements that surround them. This article first reviews the state of the art on IAR applications for shipbuilding and smart manufacturing. Then, the most relevant IAR hardware and software tools are detailed, as well as the main use cases for the application of IAR in a shipyard. Next, it is described Navantia's IAR system, which is based on a fog-computing architecture. Such a system is evaluated when making the use of three IAR devices (a smartphone, a tablet, and a pair of smart glasses), two AR software development kits (ARToolKit and Vuforia) and multiple IAR markers, with the objective of determining their performance in a shipyard workshop and inside a ship under construction. The results obtained show a remarkable performance differences among the different IAR tools and the impact of factors like lighting, pointing out the best combinations of markers, and hardware and software to be used depending on the characteristics of the shipyard scenario. © 2013 IEEE.","Augmented Reality; cyber-physical systems; identification; industrial augmented reality; industrial Internet of Things; industry 4.0; Internet of Things; smart factory; traceability","Application programs; Augmented reality; Computer hardware; Computer software; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Hardware; Identification (control systems); Industry; Internet of things; Maintainability; Manufacture; Marine engineering; Shipbuilding; Shipyards; Complex Processes; Hardware and software; Industrial augmented reality; Industrial environments; Manufacturing companies; Marine vehicles; Smart manufacturing; traceability; Ships","","","","","","","Navab N., Developing killer apps for industrial augmented reality, IEEE Comput.

Material efficiency reduces the generation of industrial waste, the extraction and consumption of resources, and energy demands and carbon emissions. However, material efficiency in the manufacturing sector, as a means of improving the recyclability, reusability, reduction and prevention of industrial waste, is little understood. This study aims to investigate, on a micro-level, further material efficiency improvement opportunities, barriers and strategies in selected manufacturing companies in Sweden, focusing on increasing waste segregation into high quality circulated raw material. Improvement opportunities at large global manufacturing companies are investigated; barriers hindering material efficiency improvement are identified and categorized at two levels; and strategies that have been deployed at manufacturing companies are reviewed. Empirical findings reveal (1) further potential for improving material efficiency through higher segregation of residual material from mixed and low quality fractions (on average, 26% of the content of combustible waste, in weight, was plastics; 8% and 6% were paper and cardboard, respectively); (2) the most influential barriers are within budgetary, information, management, employee, engineering, and communication clusters; (3) a lack of actual material efficiency strategy implementation in the manufacturing companies. According to our analysis, the majority of barriers are internal and originate within the manufacturing companies, therefore they can be managed (and eradicated if possible) with sufficient resources in terms of man hours, education and investment, better operational and environmental (waste) management, better internal communication and information sharing, and deployment of material efficiency strategies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive; Industrial waste management; Manufacturing sustainability; Material efficiency; Residual material; Waste segregation","Budget control; Carbon; Economics; Efficiency; Industrial emissions; Industrial wastes; Information management; Investments; Manufacture; Reusability; Rocks; Sustainable development; Automotive; Global manufacturing; Internal communications; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing sector; Material efficiency; Residual materials; Strategy implementations; Waste management","","","","","","","Abdul Rashid S.H., Evans S., Supply chain constraints in practising material efficiency strategies: evidence from UK companies, Sustainable Manufacturing, pp. 237-241, (2012); Abdul Rashid S., Evans S., Longhurst P., A comparison of four sustainable manufacturing strategies, Int.

Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), a commonly used non-traditional manufacturing process was considered in this study. A decision making model for the selection of process parameters in order to achieve green EDM was developed. An experimental investigation was carried out based on Taguchi L9 orthogonal array to analyze the sensitivity of green manufacturing attributes to the variations in process parameters such as peak current, pulse duration, dielectric level and flushing pressure. Weighing factors for the output responses were determined using triangular fuzzy numbers and the most desirable factor level combinations were selected based on TOPSIS technique. The model developed in this study can be used as a systematic framework for parameter optimization in environmentally conscious manufacturing processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the major class of biopharmaceutical products, but they are typically used to treat specific diseases which individually have comparably low incidences. The therapeutic potential of mAbs could also be used for more prevalent diseases, but this would require a massive increase in production capacity that could not be met by traditional fermenter systems. Here we outline the potential of plants to be used for the very-large-scale (VLS) production of biopharmaceutical proteins such as mAbs. We discuss the potential market sizes and their corresponding production capacities. We then consider available process technologies and scale-down models and how these can be used to develop VLS processes. Finally, we discuss which adaptations will likely be required for VLS production, lessons learned from existing cell culture-based processes and the food industry, and practical requirements for the implementation of a VLS process. © 2017 The Authors","Biologization; Molecular farming; Monoclonal antibodies; Plant-based production; Process economy; Very-large-scale production","Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biotechnology; Molecular Farming; Plants, Genetically Modified; Cell culture; Manufacture; Monoclonal antibodies; Surface plasmon resonance; monoclonal antibody; Biologization; Biopharmaceutical products; Biopharmaceutical proteins; Large scale productions; Molecular farming; Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); Practical requirements; Therapeutic potentials; antibody; drug development; economic activity; genetic engineering; manufacturing; molecular analysis; biotechnology; genetics; metabolism; molecular farming; transgenic plant; Antibodies","","Antibodies, Monoclonal, ","","","Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Internal Programs, (125-600164); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (269110); European Research Council, ERC","This work was funded by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft Internal Programs under Grant No. Attract 125-600164 and the European Research Council Advanced Grant “Future-Pharma”, proposlal number 269110.

The classical manufacturing process for auxetic PU foams involves multiaxial compression of the conventional parent foam, and heating of the compressed specimens above the Tm of the foam polymer. Eighty cylindrical specimens were fabricated using manufacturing routes modified from those in the open literature, with different temperatures (135 °C, 150 °C), compression ratios and different cooling methods (water or room temperature exposure). Compressive tensile cyclic loading has been applied to measure tangent modulus, Poisson's ratios and energy dissipated per unit volume. The results are used to obtain relations between manufacturing parameters, mechanical and hysteresis properties of the foams. Compression, both radial and axial, was found to be the most significant manufacturing parameter for the auxetic foams in this work. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Energy dissipation; Industrial engineering; Polymers; Auxetic foams; Cyclic tensile; Manufacturing processes; Multiaxial; Open-cell; Polyurethane foams; PU foams; Heating","","","","","","","Lakes R.S., Science, 235, (1987); Lakes R.S., Science, 238, (1987); Evans K.E., Nkansah M.A., Hutchinson I.J., Nature, 353, (1991); Herakovich C.T., J Compos Mater, 18, (1984); Clarke J.F., Duckett R.A., Hine P.J., Hutchinson I.J., Ward I.M., Composites, 25, (1994); Evans K.E., Donoghue J.P., Alderson K.L., J Compos Mater, 38, (2004); Evans K.E., Alderson K.L., J Mater Sci Lett, 11, (1992); Alderson K.L., Fitzgerald A., Evans K.E., J Mater Sci, 35, (2000); Abdel-Sayed F.K., Jones R., Burgens I.W., Composites, 10, (1979); Masters I.G., Evans K.E., Compos Struct, 35, (1996); Scarpa F., Panayiotou P., Tomlinson G., J Strain Anal, 35, (2000); Prall D., Lakes R., Int J Mech Sci, 39, (1996); Scarpa F., Blain S., Lew T., Perrott D., Ruzzene M., Yates J.R., Compos A Appl Sci Manuf, 38, (2007); Friis E.A., Lakes R.S., Park J.B., J Mater Sci, 23, (1988); Lakes R.S., Elms K., J Compos Mater, 27, (1993); Chen C.P., Lakes R.S., Cell Polym, 8, (1989); Lakes R.S., Cell Polym, 11, (1992); Howell B., Prendergast P., Hansen L., Appl Acoust, 43, (1994); Scarpa F., Ciffo L.G., Yates J.R., Smart Mater Struct, 13, (2004); Chan N., Evans K.E., J Mater Sci, 32, (1997); Gaspar N., Smith C.W., Miller E.A., Seidler G.T., Evans K.E., Phys Status Solidi B, 242, (2005); Scarpa F., Pastorino P., Garelli A., Patsias S., Ruzzene M., Phys Status Solidi B, 242, (2005); Scarpa F., Yates J.R., Ciffo L.G., Proc Inst Mech Eng C J Mech Sci, 216, (2002); Bezazi A., Scarpa F., Int J Fatigue, 29, (2007); Lakes R.S., Viscoelastic Solids, (1998); Smith C.W., Wootton R.J., Evans K.E., Exp Mech, 39, (1999); Taylor J.R., An Introduction to Error Analysis, pp. 166-168, (1997); Smith C.W., Lehman F., Wootton R.J., Evans K.E., Cell Polym, 18, (1999)","C.

In the past few years VM has been proposed as a method to augment existing metrology and has the potential to be used in control schemes for improved process control in terms of both accuracy and speed. In this paper, we propose a VM based approach for process control of semiconductor manufacturing processes on a wafer-to-wafer (W2W) basis. VM is realized by utilizing the pre-process metrology data and more importantly the process data from the underlying tools that is generally collected in real-time for fault detection (FD) purposes. The approach is developed for a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) process that may experience metrology delays, consistent process drifts, and sudden shifts in process drifts. The partial least squares (PLS) modeling technique is applied in a novel way to derive a linear regression model for the underlying process, suitable for VM purposes. A recursive moving-window approach is developed to update the VM module whenever metrology data is available. The VM data is then utilized to develop a W2W process control capability using a common run-to-run control technique. The proposed approach is applied to a simulated MIMO process and the results show considerable improvement in wafer quality as compared to other control solutions that only use lot-to-lot metrology information. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent theories and practice have extolled the virtues of team-based practices that rely on human flexibility and empowerment to improve integrated system performance. The formation of teams requires consideration of innate tendencies and interpersonal skills as well as technical skills. In this project we develop and test mathematical models for formation of effective human teams. Team membership is selected to ensure sufficient breadth and depth of technical skills. In addition, measures of worker conative tendencies are used along with empirical results on desirable team mix to form maximally effective teams.

A key part of this type of environment is the recoverable manufacturing system designed to extend product life through repair and remanufacturing. Remanufacturing systems are faced with a greater degree of uncertainty and complexity than traditional new manufacturing systems, leading to the need for planning and control systems designed to deal with the added uncertainty and complexity. In this study of a remanufacturing facility, two key activities in planning and controlling, disassembly release mechanisms (DRMs) and priority dispatching rules (PDRs) are examined via a simulation model. The results indicate that simple due-date-based priority dispatching procedures generally perform well for a variety of performance measures.

Responses in product and service design, organization of production networks, planning and management of operations, as well as production control are surveyed. As illustrated through industrial case studies, production engineering should integrate a rich body of interdisciplinary results together with contemporary information and communication technologies in order to facilitate cooperation and responsiveness that are vital in competitive, sustainable manufacturing. © 2011 CIRP.","Coordination; Production; Responsiveness","Information technology; Network management; Planning; Production control; Production engineering; Competition and cooperation; Global behaviors; Industrial case study; Information and Communication Technologies; Manufacturing enterprise; Product and services; Production network; Responsive manufacturing; Responsiveness; Sustainable manufacturing; Manufacture","","","","","National Office for Research and Technology, Hungary; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTKA, (T-73376); Nemzeti Kutatási és Technológiai Hivatal, NKTH, (OMFB-01638/2009)","The authors wish to thank all the contributors for having sent material and/or helping improve earlier versions of the paper: R.

Today, the main commercialized application of aerogels is thermal insulation, although aerogels can be used for a huge variety of applications such as electrochemistry (super capacitors), carrier of catalysts and other active agents, filling materials, materials for tissue engineering etc. However, industrial production of aerogels is so far mostly limited to silica-based systems, limiting the possibility to prove the potential application by prototyping. In this paper first the state of the art of the aerogel manufacturing and applications are briefly discussed. Based on the current status, main knowledge gaps and challenges are identified and the future research directions from the point of view of the authors are derived. In the next future, we expect significant further development in the area of the organic and hybrid aerogel aerogels, optimization of their manufacturing processes and their transfer to the market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aerogel production; Aerogels; Applications","Applications; Manufacture; Silica; Thermal insulation; Tissue engineering; Composite aerogel; Filling materials; Future research directions; High pore volumes; High surface area; Industrial production; Manufacturing process; State of the art; Aerogels","","","","","","","Vareda J.P., Lamy-Mendes A., Duraes L., A reconsideration on the definition of the term aerogel based on current drying trends, Microporous Mesoporous Mater., 258, pp. 211-216, (2018); Smirnova I., Gurikov P., Aerogels in chemical engineering: strategies toward tailor-made aerogels annu, Rev.

To reduce energy consumption and also a reduction of CO2 emissions in manufacturing processes, a reduction of the amount of primary material, made from first melting after mining, as well as secondary material, made from melting of recycled scrap material, is needed. In this work, the re-use of aluminum AA-6060 scrap based on milling and turning chips, by direct hot extrusion is presented. To prevent further use of primary aluminum or melting of the chips the process aims at using compacted chips as billet material. The production of the chips as well as the compaction of billets, the extrusion process and the properties of the final profile is presented. In addition to the use of chips based on one alloy the mixture and extrusion of aluminum and SiC particles is presented. The investigations have shown that using billets made of AA-6060 chips can lead to similar mechanical and microstructural properties as using of conventional cast aluminum billets. Investigations on an additional cutting or drilling of the extruded profiles have shown even improved properties due to a reduced chip length. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Following this vision, an emerging family of products-collaborative manufacturing robots-is enabling human and robot workers to work side by side as collaborators in manufacturing tasks. Their introduction presents an opportunity to better understand people's interactions with and perceptions of a robot ""co-worker"" in a real-world setting to guide the design of these products. In this paper, we present findings from an ethnographic field study at three manufacturing sites and a Grounded Theory analysis of observations and interviews. Our results show that, even in this safety-critical manufacturing setting, workers relate to the robot as a social entity and rely on cues to understand the robot's actions, which we observed to be critical for workers to feel safe when near the robot. These findings contribute to our understanding of interactions with robotic products in real-world settings and offer important design implications. © Copyright 2015 ACM.","Collaborative robots; Computer-supported collaborative work; Design guidelines; Human-robot collaboration; Manufacturing; Social cues; Sociality; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Computation theory; Computer supported cooperative work; Design; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Machine design; Manufacture; Product design; Robots; Collaborative robots; Human-robot collaboration; Social cues; Sociality; Technology adoption; Economic and social effects","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1149970)","","Bickmore T., Cassell J., Social dialogue with embodied conversational agents, Advances in Natural Multimodal Dialogue Systems, pp. 23-54, (2005); Breazeal C., Emotion and sociable humanoid robots, Int J Hum-Comput St 59, 1, pp. 119-155, (2003); Brogardh T., Present and future robot control development-an industrial perspective, Annu Rev Control, 31, 1, pp. 69-79, (2007); Fogg B.J., Persuasive computers: Perspectives and research directions, Proc.

Numerical analyses are performed to exploit such properties in the design of a morphing airfoil. The advantages associated with the use of composites are investigated by comparing the numerical results with those obtained with a metallic structure. A manufacturing process is then developed to assemble the considered structural configurations using composite materials. The novel process developed is described as applied to the manufacturing of macro chiral components that are tested to evaluate their ability to undergo large deformations. Finally, detailed numerical models of the manufactured structures are presented as a possible approach to evaluate the strength of the proposed configuration. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Intensification of service and knowledge contents within product life cycles is considered crucial for dematerialization, in particular, to design optimal product-service systems from the viewpoint of environmentally conscious design and manufacturing in advanced post industrial societies. The paper tries to define service as an activity that changes the state of a service receiver. Service contents of the service is provided by a service provider and delivered through a service channel. Artifacts are either the service contents or the service channel. Service engineering looks at development, design, and production of services and aims at improving the efficiency and quality of the service as well as its delivery. To establish service engineering, the paper then proposes a modeling technique of service. © 2001 IEEE.","","Design; Manufacture; Mechanical variables measurement; Product design; Dematerialization; Industrial societies; Knowledge content; Modeling technique; Product life cycles; Product-service systems; Service engineering; Service provider; Life cycle","","","","","","","Tomiyama T., Sakao T., Umeda Y., Baba Y., The Post-Mass Production Paradigm, Knowledge Intensive Engineering, and Soft Machines, Life Cycle Modelling for Innovative Products and Processes, pp. 369-380, (1995); Tomiyama T., A Manufacturing Paradigm Toward the 21st Century, Integrated Computer Aided Engineering, 4, pp. 159-178, (1997); Tomiyama T., The Post Mass Production Paradigm, Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Environmentally Conscious Design and Inverse Manufacturing (EcoDesign 99), pp. 162-167, (1999); Tomiyama T., Knowledge Intensive Engineering towards Sustainable Products with High Knowledge and Service Contents, TMCE 2000, Third International Symposium on Tools and Methods of Competitive Engineering, pp. 55-67, (2000); Tomiyama T., From General Design Theory to Knowledge-Intensive Engineering, Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing, 8, 4, pp. 319-333, (1994); Tomiyama T., Umeda Y., Ishii M., Yoshioka M., Kiriyama T., Knowledge Systematization for a Knowledge Intensive Engineering Framework, Knowledge Intensive CAD, 1, pp. 33-52, (1996); Shostack G.L., How to Design a Service, Marketing of Services, (1981); Hollins G., Hollins B., Total Design: Managing the Design Process in the Service Sector, (1991); Ramaswamy R., Design and Management of Service Processes: Keeping Customers for Life, (1996); Oksana M., Product Service Systems - Final Report, the International Institute of Industrial Environmental Economics, (2000); Brezet J.C., Bijma A.S., Ehrenfeld J., Silvester S., The Design of Eco-Efficient Services: Method, Tools and Review of the Case Study Based Designing Eco-Efficient Services Project, (2001); Andrade R., On the Design of Services, WDK 28, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Engineering Design in Glasgow 2001, Book 2, Design Management - Processes and Information Issues, pp. 299-304, (2001); Low M.K., Williams D.J., Linking Eco-Design Developments to Market Drivers and Societal Needs, a Framework for Innovation, The Proceeding of the 6th CIRP International Seminar on Life Cycle Engineering, pp. 180-189, (1999); Stevels A., Five Ways to Make Money While Being Green, The Proceeding of the 7th CIRP International Seminar on Life Cycle Engineering, pp. 23-29, (2000); Tomiyama T., Umeda Y., Sakao T., Shimomura Y., Knowledge Intensive Maintenance and Soft Machines: New Approaches toward Advanced Maintenance, MED, 4, pp. 541-548, (1996); Brnnstrm O., Elstrm B.-O., Thompson G., Functional Products Create New Demands on Product Development Organization, WDK 28, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Engineering Design in Glasgow 2001, Book 2, Design Management - Processes and Information Issues, pp. 305-312, (2001); Seliger G., Basdere B., Schumann S., Wapler M., Technological Conditions for Selling Use instead of Selling Products, The Proceeding of the 7th CIRP International Seminar on Life Cycle Engineering, pp. 17-22, (2000); Lindahl M., Lundh G., The Meaning of Functional Sales, Proceedings of the 8th CIRP International Seminar on Life Cycle Engineering - Life Cycle Engineering: Challenges and Opportunities, pp. 211-220, (2001); WBCSD, Cleaner Production and Eco-Efficiency - Complementary Approaches to Sustainable Development, The World Business Council for Sustainable Development and United Nations Environment Programme - Industry and Environment, (1998); Von Weizscker E., Lovins A.B., Hunter Lovins L., Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use: The New Report to the Club of Rome, (1997); Umeda Y., Ishii M., Yoshioka M., Shimomura Y., Tomiyama T., Supporting Conceptual Design based on the Function-Behavior-State Modeler, Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing, 10, 4, pp. 275-288, (1996); Umeda Y., Nonomura A., Tomiyama T., A Study on Life-Cycle Design for the Post Mass Production Paradigm, Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing, 14, 2, pp. 149-161, (2000)","T.

The primary control issue is how to assign workers to jobs/stations over time. Under assumptions of complete worker flexibility and collaborative work, we prove that a simple expedite policy minimizes along each sample path the cycle time (delay) for each job. Therefore, the expedite policy also minimizes work in process and maximizes throughput along every sample path. We also compute the performance improvement opportunity achievable using flexible workers as opposed to the optimal static allocation of workers. This enables us to examine the factors that make workforce agility a potentially attractive strategy. We also consider the intuitive analog of the expedite policy for the noncollaborative work environment, which we call the pick-and-run policy; however, we demonstrate by counterexample that it is not always optimal. Finally, we extend some of our insights from the demand-constrained environment to a capacity-constrained environment operating under a CONstant WIP (CONWIP) protocol.","","Agile manufacturing systems; Constraint theory; Flexible manufacturing systems; Mathematical models; Optimization; Productivity; Throughput; Collaborative work systems; Noncollaborative work systems; Workforce agility; Industrial engineering","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; General Motors of Canada","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants NO.

An extensive survey of concepts, techniques, approaches and suitability of various commercialised rapid casting (RC) solutions with traditional casting methods is presented. Design/methodology/approach: The tooling required for producing metal casting such as fabrication of patterns, cores and moulds with RC directly by using different approaches are presented and evaluated. Relevant case studies and examples explaining the suitability and problems of using RC solutions by various manufacturers and researchers are also presented. Findings: Latest research to optimize the current RC solutions, and new inventions in processing techniques and materials in RC performed by researchers worldwide are also discussed. The discussion regarding the benefits of RC solutions to foundrymen, and challenges to produce accurate and cost-effective RC amongst AM manufacturers concludes this paper. Research limitations/implications: The research related to this survey is limited to the applicability of RC solutions to sand casting and investment casting processes. There is practically no implication in industrial application of RC technology. Originality/value: This review presents the information regarding potential AM application - RC, which facilitates the fabrication of patterns, cores and moulds directly using the computer-aided design data. The information available in this paper serves the purpose of researchers and academicians to explore the new options in the field of RC and especially users, manufacturers and service industries to produce casting in relatively much shorter time and at low cost and even to cast complex design components which otherwise was impossible by using traditional casting processes and CNC technology. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Foundry engineering; Investment casting; Metalworking industry; Rapid casting solutions; Rapid investment casting; Rapid sand casting; Sand casting","Computer aided design; Industrial applications; Industry; Investment casting; Investments; Machine shops; Metal castings; Molds; Research; Surveys; Additive Manufacturing; Foundry engineering; Metalworking industry; Rapid casting solutions; Rapid sand casting; Sand casting; Manufacture","","","","","","","Ashley S., Rapid prototyping is coming of age, Mechanical Engineering, 117, 7, pp. 62-68, (1995); Bak D., Rapid prototyping or rapid production? 3D printing processes move industry towards the latter, Assembly Automation, 23, 4, pp. 340-345, (2003); Bassoli E., Atzeni E., Direct metal rapid casting: Mechanical optimization and tolerance calculation, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 15, 4, pp. 238-243, (2009); Bassoli E., Gatto A., Iuliano L., Violante M.G., 3D printing technique applied to rapid casting, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 13, 3, pp. 148-155, (2007); Beaman J.J., Barlow J.W., Bourell D.L., Crawford R.H., Marcus H.I., McAlea K.P., Solid Freeform Fabrication: A New Direction in Manufacturing, (1997); Bernard A., Deplace J., Perry N., Gabriel S., Integration of CAD and rapid manufacturing for sand casting optimization, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 9, pp. 327-333, (2003); Carrion A., Technology forecast on ink-jet head technology applications in rapid prototyping, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 3, 3, pp. 99-115, (1997); Cheah C.M., Chua C.K., Lee C.W., Feng C., Totong K., Rapid prototyping and tooling techniques: A review of applications for rapid investment casting, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 25, 3-4, pp. 308-320, (2005); Chua C.K., Three-dimensional rapid prototyping technologies and key development areas, Computing & Control Engineering Journal, 5, 4, pp. 200-206, (1994); Chua C.K., Hong K.H., Ho S.L., Rapid tooling technology.

This paper introduces a specification framework for the delivery of industrial learning and training, addressing the needs for the ""knowledge"" workers of the factories of the future. A review of the relevant background, including the activities associated with the industrial learning and its basic methods as well as some emerging paradigms, is first provided. A Teaching Factory based paradigm is then suggested as the conceptual foundation of this framework. A cognitive framework, addressing the major building blocks of the industrial learning process, namely the attitude the knowledge the skills and the competences is being defined. An appropriate technology framework, dealing with the needs of engineers and blue-collar workers, for practising the manufacturing knowledge content within digital environments, is suggested at this point. Finally, the approach of the future implementation of the specific framework is being discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Industrial learning and training; Manufacturing education; Teaching Factory","Industry; Manufacture; Personnel training; Appropriate technologies; Cognitive frameworks; Conceptual foundations; Digital environment; Factories of the futures; Learning and training; Manufacturing knowledge; Specification frameworks; Engineering education","","","","","European ICT Forum; FP7/2007; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (258617); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Acknowledgements Part of the work presented in this paper has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n◦ 258617 “Ac-tionPlanT - The European ICT Forum for the Factories of the Future”.","Project Website, (2010); Alptekin S.E., Pouraghabagher R., McQuaid P., Waldorf D., Proceedings of the 2001 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, American Society for Engineering Education, (2001); Further Education at AutoUni, (2010); Azadivar F., Kramer B., Rewards and Challenges of Utilizing University Research/economic Development Centers for Enhancing Engineering Education, (2007); Bloom B.S., Engelhart M.D., Furst E.J., Hill W.H., Krathwohl D.R., Taxonomy of Educational Objectives.

Most of DFM approaches usually consider only one manufacturing process, but product competitiveness may be improved by designing hybrid modular products, in which products are seen as 3-D puzzles with modules realized individually by the best manufacturing process and further gathered. A new DFM system is created in order to give quantitative information during the product design stage of which modules will benefit in being machined and which ones will advantageously be realized by an additive process (such as Selective Laser Sintering or laser deposition). A methodology for a manufacturability evaluation in case of a subtractive or an additive manufacturing process is developed and implemented in a CAD software.

These new techniques and technologies are usually referred to as rapid prototyping and manufacturing technologies, and they allow prototypes to be produced in a wide range of materials with remarkable precision in a couple of hours. Although they have been rapidly incorporated into product development methodologies, they are still under development, and their applications in bioengineering are continuously evolving. Rapid prototyping and manufacturing technologies can be of assistance in every stage of the development process of novel biodevices, to address various problems that can arise in the devices' interactions with biological systems and the fact that the design decisions must be tested carefully.

Its primary advantage over other deposition methods is the low-cost and maskless on-demand patterning, which offers unmatched freedom-of-design. Additional benefits include the efficient use of materials, contactless high-resolution deposition, and scalability, enabling rapid translation of learning from small-scale, laboratory-based research into large-scale industrial roll-to-roll manufacturing. In the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), IJP has enabled the printing of many of the multiple functional layers which comprise the complete cell as part of an additive printing scheme. Although IJP is only recently employed in perovskite solar cell (PeSC) fabrication, it is already showing great promise and is anticipated to find broader application with this class of materials. As OSCs and PeSCs share many common functional materials and device architectures, this review presents a progress report on the IJP of OSCs and PeSCs in order to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two technologies, with critical analyses of the challenges and opportunities also presented. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Using the data from Chinese listed industrial firms from 2008 to 2015, we find that politically connected CEOs and CEOs with stronger political connections promote more green innovation. In addition, we compared the impact of CEOs with connections involving central or local government on green innovation. The results suggest that only CEOs have political connections with central government significantly affect green innovation. Furthermore, we investigated the moderating effects of the three external governance factors, environmental enforcement intensity (EEI), media coverage (Media_JF) and analyst coverage (Analyst), and our results show that EEI negatively moderates this relationship, the moderating effect of Media is negligible, and Analyst significantly and positively regulates the relationship between CEO political connections and green innovation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analyst coverage; Chinese listed industrial firms; Environmental enforcement intensity; Green innovation; Media coverage; Politically connected CEOs","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Analyst coverages; Central government; Environmental enforcement; Green innovations; Local government; Mediating roles; Moderating effect; Political Connections; Green manufacturing","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Kwon S.W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, Acad.

In FPGA devices, PUFs may be instantiated directly from FPGA fabric components in order to exploit the propagation delay differences of signals caused by manufacturing process variations. Multiple delay based PUF architectures have been proposed. However, we have observed inconsistent results among them. Ring Oscillator PUF works fine, while other delay based PUFs show a significantly lower quality. Rather than proposing complex system level solutions, we focus on the fundamental building blocks of the PUF. In our effort to compare the various delay based PUF architectures, we have closely examined how each architecture maps into the FPGA fabric. Our conclusions are that arbiter and butterfly PUF architectures are ill suited for FPGAs, because delay skew due to routing asymmetry is over 10 times higher than the random variation due to manufacturing process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","Cavity resonators; Fabrics; Industrial engineering; Oscillators (electronic); Production engineering; Complex systems; FPGA devices; FPGA fabric; Fundamental building blocks; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing process variations; Multiple delays; Physical unclonable functions; Propagation delays; Random variation; Ring oscillator; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)","","","","","","","Guajardo J., Kumar S.S., Schrijen G.-J., Tuyls P., FPGA intrinsic PUFs and their use for IP protection, Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, (2007); Lim D., Lee J.W., Gassend B., Suh G.E., Van Dijk M., Devadas S., Extracting secret keys from integrated circuits, IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems, 13, 10, pp. 1200-1205, (2005); Kumar S.S., Guajardo J., Maes R., Schrijen G.J., Tuyls P., The Butterfly PUF: Protecting IP on every FPGA, IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust, HOST (2008); Sedcole P., Cheung P.Y.K., Within-die delay variability in 90nm FPGAs and beyond, Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Field Programmable Technology (2006); Suh G.E., Devadas S., Physical Unclonable Functions for Device Authentication and Secret Key Generation, Proceedings of Design Automation Conference (2007); Morozov S., Maiti A., Schaumont P., A Comparative Analysis of Delay Based PUF Implementations on FPGA, (2009)","S.

Since it has a wide variety of work areas, students encounter with the problem of taking a decision on which sector to work in the future. Therefore, a questionnaire has been conducted on 60 students who study at Industrial Engineering department at different universities in Turkey. Fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis) methods have been applied to the results of the questionnaire that has been done for 7 sectors (manufacturing, logistics, finance/ banking, health, technology, software/ informatics and academics) and 10 criteria (payment, job satisfaction, career opportunities, being productive, having a goal, status, guidance/ pressure, social opportunities, employment deficit and easiness of job). The significance of criteria has been determined by using the fuzzy AHP method while the sectors that have been preferred mostly within the certain criteria have been determined using the fuzzy MOORA method. Finally, the most commonly preferred sectors have been identified as technology, software/informatics and finance. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Fulton Schools of Engineering, Arizona State University, United States","Material extrusion-based 3D printing processes have shown importance in the overall development of the field of additive manufacturing and displayed tremendous potential to becoming a cross-cutting tool for research, engineering, developmental work in a wide array of disciplines. In the context of the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM, one form of Materials extrusion-based 3D printing), one of the main process issues lies in the property anisotropy of parts built using this method, even with process optimization. To address this issue, we report a near-IR laser-based pre-deposition heating method to locally heat up the region of an existing layer near the nozzle before an extrudate comes in contact with the heated region. This in-process approach raises the inter-layer interface temperature to above the critical temperature to increase the interpenetrating diffusion, and therefore the inter-layer bond strength. A 50% increase in the inter-layer bond strength in parts built with this approach is demonstrated. The in-process pre-deposition local heating approach reported here represents an effective means to increase the inter-layer bond strength, and property isotropy of FDM parts. Further, this approach is capable of real-time monitoring and controlling of temperatures at the inter-layer and inter-filament interfaces across the entire volume of a built part, allowing control of the physics of the FDM process to achieve desired mechanical properties. © 2016","3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Inter-layer bond; Inter-layer strength","Bond strength (materials); Cutting tools; Deposition; Engineering research; Extrusion; Industrial research; Infrared lasers; Layered manufacturing; Manufacture; Optimization; Printing; 3-D printing; 3D printing process; Bond strengthening; Critical temperatures; Fused deposition modeling; Inter-layers; Near-IR lasers; Real-time monitoring and controlling; 3D printers","","","","","","","Anitha R., Arunachalam S., Radhakrishnan P., Critical parameters influencing the quality of prototypes in fused deposition modelling, J Mater Process Technol, 118, 1-3, pp. 385-388, (2001); Nancharaiah T., Raju D.R., Raju V.R., An experimental investigation on surface quality and dimensional accuracy of FDM components, Int J Emerg Technol, 1, 2, pp. 106-111, (2010); Thrimurthulu K., Pandey P.M., Reddy N.V., Optimum part deposition orientation in fused deposition modeling, Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 44, 6, pp. 585-594, (2004); Horvath D., Noorani R., Mendelson M., Improvement of surface roughness on ABS 400 polymer using design of experiments (DOE), Mater Sci Forum, 561, pp. 2389-2392, (2007); Wang C.C., Lin T.W., Hu S.S., Optimizing the rapid prototyping process by integrating the Taguchi method with the gray relational analysis, Rapid Prototyp J, 13, 5, pp. 304-315, (2007); Sood A.K., Ohdar R., Mahapatra S., Improving dimensional accuracy of fused deposition modelling processed part using grey Taguchi method, Mater Des, 30, 10, pp. 4243-4252, (2009); Zhang J.W., Peng A.H., Process-parameter optimization for fused deposition modeling based on Taguchi method, Adv Mater Res, 538, pp. 444-447, (2012); Sahu R.K., Mahapatra S., Sood A.K., A study on dimensional accuracy of fused deposition modeling (FDM) processed parts using fuzzy logic, J Manuf Sci Prod, 13, 3, pp. 183-197, (2013); Lee B., Abdullah J., Khan Z., Optimization of rapid prototyping parameters for production of flexible ABS object, J Mater Process Technol, 169, 1, pp. 54-61, (2005); Laeng J., Khan Z.A., Khu S.Y., Optimizing flexible behavior of bow prototype using Taguchi approach, J Appl Sci, 6, pp. 622-630, (2006); Zhang Y., Chou K., A parametric study of part distortions in fused deposition modelling using three-dimensional finite element analysis, Proc Inst Mech Eng B, 222, 8, pp. 959-968, (2008); Nancharaiah T., Optimization of process parameters in FDM process using design of experiments, Int J Emerg Technol, 2, 1, pp. 100-102, (2011); Kumar G.P., Regalla S.P., Optimization of support material and build time in fused deposition modeling (FDM), Appl Mech Mater, 110, pp. 2245-2251, (2012); Ahn S.H., Montero M., Odell D., Et al., Anisotropic material properties of fused deposition modeling ABS, Rapid Prototyp J, 8, 4, pp. 248-257, (2002); Ang K.C., Leong K.F., Chua C.K., Et al., Investigation of the mechanical properties and porosity relationships in fused deposition modelling-fabricated porous structures, Rapid Prototyp J, 12, 2, pp. 100-105, (2006); Sood A.K., Ohdar R.K., Mahapatra S.S., Parametric appraisal of mechanical property of fused deposition modelling processed parts, Mater Des, 31, 1, pp. 287-295, (2010); Percoco G., Lavecchia F., Galantucci L.M., Compressive properties of FDM rapid prototypes treated with a low cost chemical finishing, Res J Appl Sci Eng Technol, 4, 19, pp. 3838-3842, (2012); Rayegani F., Onwubolu G.C., Fused deposition modelling (FDM) process parameter prediction and optimization using group method for data handling (GMDH) and differential evolution (DE), Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 73, 1-4, pp. 509-519, (2014); Masood S.H., Mau K., Song W.Q., Tensile properties of processed FDM polycarbonate material, Mater Sci Forum, 654, pp. 2556-2559, (2010); Ahn S.-H., Montero M., Odell D., Roundy S., Wright P.K., Anisotropic material properties of fused deposition modeling ABS, Rapid Prototyp, 8, 4, (2002); Rodriguez J.F., Thomas J.P., Renaud J.E., Tailoring the mechanical properties of fused-deposition manufactured components, Proc. rapid. prototyping and manufacturing’99, vol. 3, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Dearborn, MI, pp. 629-643, (1999); Yan Y., Zhang R., Guodong H., Yuan X., Research on the bonding of material paths in melted extrusion modeling, Mater Design, 21, pp. 93-99, (2000); Partain S., Fused deposition modeling with localized pre-deposition heating using forced air, (2007); De Gennes P.G., Reptation of a polymer chain in the presense of fixed obstacles, J Chem Phys, 572, (1971); Wool R.P., Yuan B.L., MacGarel J., Welding of polymer interfaces, J Polym Eng Sci, 29, (1989)","K.H.

To discuss the problem from economics and business perspectives, this study proposes a new use of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) as a methodology for unified (operational and environmental) assessment. A unique feature of the proposed approach is that it separates outputs into desirable and undesirable categories. Such separation is important because energy industries usually produce both desirable and undesirable outputs. This study discusses how to unify the two types of outputs under natural and managerial disposability. The proposed DEA approach evaluates various organizations by the three efficiency measures such as OE (Operational Efficiency), UEN (Unified Efficiency under Natural disposability) and UENM (Unified Efficiency under Natural and Managerial disposability). An important feature of UENM is that it separates inputs into two categories and unifies them under the two disposability concepts in addition to the proposed output separation and unification. This study incorporates an amount of capital assets for technology innovation, as one of the two input group, into the measurement of UENM. Then, it compares UENM with the other two efficiency measures. This study is the first research effort in which DEA has an analytical capability to quantify the importance of investment on capital assets for technology innovation. To confirm the practicality of the proposed approach, this study applies the three efficiency measures to a data set regarding manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries of 47 prefectures in Japan. This study empirically confirms the validity of Porter hypothesis in Japanese manufacturing industries, so implying that environmental regulation has been effective for betterment on the performance of Japanese manufacturing industries. Another important finding is that the emission of greenhouse gases is a main source of unified inefficiency in the two groups of industries. Therefore, Japanese industries, examined in this study, need to make their efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution substances by investing in capital assets for technology innovation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","DEA; Efficiency; Environmental assessment; Technology innovation","Japan; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Engineering research; Environmental regulations; Greenhouse gases; Industry; Investments; Managers; Manufacture; Technology; Air pollution; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Engineering research; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Managers; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Business perspective; DEA; Environmental assessment; Environmental efficiency; Industrial pollution; Japanese manufacturing; Operational efficiencies; Technology innovation; Manufacturing industries; analytical method; atmospheric pollution; data acquisition; environmental economics; environmental policy; regional economy; regional planning; sustainable development; waste disposal; economic growth; environmental protection; investment; manufacturing; pollution control; regional pattern; technological development; Economics; Industrial economics","","","","","JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (24530287)","This work is supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 24530287.

Tool coating is one key factor to realize high speed machining and green manufacturing. However, the tool coatings used presently in machining of titanium alloys cannot meet with the requirement of high speed machining and green manufacturing processes. The nanocomposite coatings can be alternativly applied in high-speed machining of α+β phase titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. In this research, the wear rate, wear pattern and wear mechanism of two kinds of nanocomposite coatings, (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si3N4) and (nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si3N4), in dry and MQL conditions were investigated. Results showed that (1) MQL condition, which has cooling and lubricating effects, was found to have more significant influence in improving the tool life as compared to dry condition. Furthermore, the (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool was confirmed to be more suitable for machining of titanium alloy than (nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool under MQL condition, which emphasizes the significance of matching between cutting fluids and coating materials. (2) The slower wear rate of (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool in MQL condition was obtained than that of the (nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool. As a result, MQL condition can greatly prolong the tool life of (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool while has minor influence on improving the tool life of (nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool. (3) Adhesive wear was observed to be the main wear type. The MQL technique not only has cooling and lubricating effects on nanocomposite coated tool, but also helps to form powerful protective layer. In addition, in MQL condition, the (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool only suffered adhesive wear while the (nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si3N4) coated tool suffered adhesive, diffusion and oxidation wear. In contrast, when turning tests were performed under dry cutting condition, adhesive wear and oxidation wear might be the main wear types for the two coated carbide tools. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","(nc-AlCrN)/(a-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) coating; (nc-AlTiN)/(a-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) coating; High-speed machining; Minimum quantity lubrication (MQL); Titanium alloys","Coatings; Cutting fluids; Industrial engineering; Machining; Nanocomposites; Production engineering; Silicon; Titanium alloys; Tools; Tribology; Coated carbide tools; Diffusion and oxidation; Green manufacturing; Green manufacturing process; High speed machining; Lubricating effect; Minimum quantity lubrication; Nano-composite coating; Aluminum coatings","","","","","","","Mustafizur R., A review on high-speed machining of titanium alloys, International Journal Series C-Mechanical Systems Machine Elements and Manufacturing, 49, 1, pp. 11-20, (2006); Hassan A., Yao Z.Q., Minimum lubrication milling of titanium alloys, Materials Science Forum, pp. 87-91, (2004); Wang G., Rahman M., Wong Y.S., Neo K.S., Sun J., Tan C.H., Onozuka H., Study on orthogonal turning of titanium alloys with different coolant supply strategies, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 42, 7-8, pp. 621-632, (2009); Attanasio A., Gelfi M., Giardini C., Remino C., Minimum quantity lubrication in turning, Wear, 260, pp. 333-338, (2006); Marksberry P.W., Jawahir I.S., A comprehensive tool-wear/tool-life performance model in the evaluation of NDM (near dry machining) for sustainable manufacturing, International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 48, 7-8, pp. 878-886, (2008); Weinert K., Inasaki I., Sutherland J.W., Wakabayashi T., Dry machining and minimum quantity lubrication, CIRP Annals, 53, pp. 511-537, (2004); Lukaszkowicz K., Review of nanocomposite thin films and coatings deposited by PVD and CVD technology, Nanomaterials, pp. 145-162, (2011); Moore J.J., Park I.-W.L., Mishra J.B., Kim K.H., Nanostructured multifunctional tribological coatings, Nanocomposite Thin Films and Coatings, pp. 329-379, (2007); Settineri L., Faga M.G., Gautier G., Perucca M., Evaluation of wear resistance of AlSiTiN and AlSiCrN nanocomposite coatings for cutting tools, CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology, 57, pp. 575-578, (2008); Veprek S., Veprek-Heijman M.G.J., Karvankova P., Prochazka J., Different approaches to superhard coatings and nanocomposites, Thin Solid Films, 476, 1, pp. 1-29, (2005); Jakubeczyova1 D., Hagarova Maria, The study of two types of PVD coatings on the substrate made by powder metallurgy, Acta Metallurgica Slovaca, 18, 4, pp. 191-199, (2012); Zhang S., Sun D., Bui X.L., Magnetron sputtered hard and yet tough nanocomposite coatings with case studies: nanocrystalline TiN embedded in amorphous SiN<sub>X</sub>, in: Sam Zhang, Nasar Ali (Eds.), Nanocomposite, Thin Films and Coatings, (2007); Dhar N.R., Kamuzzaman M., Ahmed M., Effect of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) on tool wear and surface roughness in turning AISI4340 steel, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 172, pp. 299-304, (2006); Astakhov V.P., Metal cutting theory foundations of near-dry (MQL) machining, International Journal of Machining and Machinability of Materials, 7, pp. 1-16, (2010); Sun J., Guo Y.B., A comprehensive experimental study on surface integrity by end milling Ti-6Al-4V, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 209, 8, pp. 4036-4042, (2009); Sun J., Wong Y.S., Rahman M., Wang Z.G., Neo K.S., Tan C.H., Onozuka H., Effects of coolant supply methods and cutting conditions on tool life in end milling titanium alloy, Machining Science and Technology, 10, 3, pp. 355-370, (2006); Zhao W., He N., Li L., High speed milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with minimal quantity lubrication, Key Engineering Material, 329, pp. 663-668, (2007)","M.

Based on a comparative case study methodology conducted across four case companies, and an analysis of extensive documentary data, the study challenges the dichotomous ‘either-or thinking’ in servitization research and highlights ‘both-and thinking’ by identifying both paradoxes and coping practices. The study extends the literature by identifying four paradoxes in servitization: 1) effectiveness in the customization of solutions vs. efficiency in product manufacturing, 2) building a customer orientation vs. maintaining an engineering mindset, 3) organizing product and service integration vs. separated services and product organizations, and 4) exploratory innovation in solutions vs. exploitative innovation in product manufacturing. Moreover, the study identifies nine practices that manufacturing companies apply when coping with the paradoxical challenges that emerge during servitization. The findings may help manufacturing companies understand, accept, and address paradoxical challenges and balance tensions, as not all tensions can be resolved. The identification of these paradoxes allows us to understand the difficulties that manufacturing companies face during the servitization process and may help explain the servitization-deservitization trend among some manufacturing companies that some recent studies have identified. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coping practices; Paradox theory; Product-service systems (PSS); Servitization and digital servitization; Strategic change; Strategy-as-practice (SAP, Practice theory)","Industrial economics; Industrial engineering; Coping practices; Paradox theory; Practice theories; Productservice system (PSS); Servitization; Strategic changes; Manufacture","","","","","Business Finland","This paper is a product of the Dimecc S4Fleet research project.

In the recent decades, the advancement of environmental technology and introduction of comprehensive environmental management systems have highlighted the intangible benefits of environmental management practices and their potential to drive organizational competitiveness. Accumulating evidence on the potential benefits of environmental protectionism has given rise to a series of environmental management practices and systems, such as energy informatics, environmental management standardization frameworks, and green supplier management and collaboration. However, existing literature lacks a clear conceptualization and a coherent theoretical framework of environmental management. In addition, no systematic framework exists for the design and implementation of environmental management practices that guide organizations in deciding on the practices or systems that they should implement given their organizational situations. Thus, this study aims to develop an energy and utility maturity framework for systematic measurement and management of natural resource consumption. Specifically, the proposed framework, energy and utility management maturity model (EUMMM), was designed based on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI). EUMMM has two major functions. First, it provides an assessment framework for analyzing the maturity level of energy and utility management in organizations. Second, it provides a progressive framework to guide organizational advancement in energy and utility management. A collaborative pilot study was conducted to validate the effectiveness, practicability, and convenience of the EUMMM. The results indicated that EUMMM successfully led the participating companies to move along the environmental management maturity path. Theoretically, this study extends the application of CMMI to the context of natural resource management and develops a progressive framework for energy and utility management maturation. Practically, this study provides a robust guideline for practitioners in analyzing and advancing energy and utility maturity levels to achieve a sustainable manufacturing process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Case study; Energy and utility management maturity model; Sustainable manufacturing; Textile manufacturing","Environmental impact; Environmental management systems; Industrial engineering; International trade; Natural resources management; Software engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Design and implementations; Environmental management practices; Manufacturing industries; Natural resource management; Sustainable manufacturing; Textile manufacturing; Utility management; Production engineering","","","","","RGC, (B-Q27D)","The authors are grateful for the constructive comments of the referees on an earlier version of this paper.

Design/methodology/approach The sparse literature on the EIA of RP and RT is balanced by that of the comparatively mature field of industrial ecology (IE). Hence, the review emphasizes portable IE measurement and evaluations methods. As RP and RT can also be viewed as design tools and mass customization manufacturing, other EIA may be needed. Findings The scarcity of research to date combined with rapid technological advances leaves a large number of unresolved issues. In addition, the special character of RP and RT, as design and manufacturing enablers implies that future research is needed. Research limitations/implications This review is drawn from a technology in rapid evolution. Hence, unresolved issues focus on technologies that already are on the market and the research needs are formulated in terms of state of the art process research. Practical implications As technological advances multiply, so does the number of unresolved environmental problems. The review of unresolved issues points to a pressing need to assess the consequences of RP and RT while identified research needs point the way to anticipated areas where further assessment methods will be needed. Originality/value This paper intends to raise awareness about the potential environmental impacts from RP and RT, by presenting the problems associated with current methods for measuring environmental effects and discussing some of the most urgent unresolved issues, specifically with respect to materials. Indirect effects of other uses of RP and RT are discussed only briefly for lack of available data. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Environmental management; Rapid prototypes","Design aids; Ecology; Environmental engineering; Environmental impact; Industrial engineering; Machine design; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Environmental management; Rapid prototypes; Rapid tooling (RT); Rapid prototyping","","","","","","","American Dye Source, (2002); Baumann H., Rydberg T., Life-cycle assessment: a comparison of three methods for impact analysis and evaluation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 2, 1, pp. 13-20, (1994); Beltoft V., Nielsen E., Evaluation of health hazards by exposure to propylene carbonate and estimation of a limit value in air, Safety and Health Topics, NIOSH/OSHA/DOE Health Guidelines, (2003); Boothroyd G., Hinckley D., Plafkin J., Slimak M., Product Design for Manufacture and Assembly, (1994); Borland N., Wallace D., Environmentally conscious product design, Journal of Industrial Ecology, 3, 2-3, pp. 33-46, (2000); Bras B., EBM systems level issues, (2000); Dogru A.H., Sebastian D.H., Materials-flow modeling for design for environment, Journal of Integrated Design & Process Science, 3, 4, pp. 37-47, (2000); Dove R., Rapid production economics, mass customization, and agile manufacturing: issues, examples, and implications, (2003); Dickinson D.A., Draper C.W., Saminathan M., Sohn J.E., Williams G., Green product manufacturing, AT&T Technical Journal, 12, pp. 26-35, (1995); Duffie N., Technology trends in green manufacturing, (1998); Durham D.R., Environmentally Benign manufacturing: current practice and future trends, Journal of the Minerals Metals & Materials Society, 54, 5, pp. 34-38, (2002); Erkman S., Industrial ecology: a new perspective on the future of the industrial system, Swiss Medical Weekly, 131, pp. 531-538, (2001); Fava J., Consoli F., Denison R., Dickson K., Mohin T., Vigon B., A Conceptual Framework for Life-Cycle Impact Assessment, (1993); Frosch R.A., Gallopoulos N.E., Strategies for manufacturing, Scientific American, 261, pp. 94-102, (1989); Garner A., Keoleian G.A., Industrial ecology: an introduction, pp. 1-32, (1995); Giannatsis J., Dedoussis V., Karalekas D., Architectural scale modeling using stereolitography, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 8, 3, pp. 200-207, (2002); Graedel T.J., Allenby B.R., Industrial Ecology, (1995); Grenda E., User views on rapid prototyping, (2002); Grimm T., Stereolitography, Selective Laser Sintering and Poly JetTM: Evaluating and Applying the Right Technology, (2002); Grimm, Wohlers, Obstacles to growth, Perspectives: Time Compression Technologies, (2002); Gungor A., Gupta S.M., Issues in environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery: a survey, Computer & Industrial Engineering, 36, pp. 811-853, (1999); Gutowski T., Environmentally benign manufacturing, (2000); Haigh P.M., Direct machining of sand moulds using the Patternless® process provides a fast manufacturing route for a cast valve, SARE Newsletter Series 3.

Samples were obtained from commercial production plants and were collected at different manufacturing stages. As the powder properties of milk powder are defined in spray-drying and the subsequent manufacturing processes, the powder samples were collected at the exit of the spray drying chamber and the exit(s) of the fluidized bed(s), and the surface compositions of the powder samples collected were studied using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). For all three industrial spray-dried milk powders, no significant differences in surface composition were observed between the samples collected at different manufacturing stages, except for a slight increase (3%) in the surface fat coverage for whole milk powder after the fluidized bed drying process. These results indicate that the surface composition of milk powders is determined to a large extent during the spray drying process and that the subsequent fluidized bed drying and handling processes have no or little effect on the surface composition of milk powders, even though these processes affect the final powder quality (e.g. moisture content, particle size). For whole milk powder and instant whole milk powder, no fat appeared to leak out on to the powder surface during the fluidized bed drying process; however, the fat present on the powder surface after the spray-drying process appeared to flow over the particle surfaces, resulting in a slight increase in the surface fat coverage. After lecithin treatment (instantization), because a mixture of lecithin and anhydrous milk fat was sprayed on the powder, a slight increase in the thickness of the surface fat layer was observed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The study draws the findings from the interviews that were conducted within four Hong Kong manufacturing companies in 1999. The current state of the EC problem has been examined in the aspects of volume, sources, and effects while the present industrial practice in managing ECs have been investigated in terms of documentation, organisation, and activities. The study has highlighted two general findings. One is that EC is a noticeable problem that cannot be underestimated in the competitive environment facing the manufacturing industries. This indicates that more effort is required to process ECs effectively and efficiently. Another finding is that the management of ECs is unsatisfactory in the companies surveyed. This indicates that a good engineering change management (ECM) system including guidelines, methodologies, and/or techniques is necessary for better dealing with ECs in the product development process. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main challenge in modern industrial applications is the sheer volume of data involved in the design process. While using high-level abstraction is necessary to manage this data and analyze the system as a whole, designers need also to retain all the low-level information of the system, in order to be able to perform optimizations and modifications at later times. The solution proposed here is to use a hierarchy of models, each one describing the system at different levels of abstraction, and arrange them in such a way that it is possible to easily map each level onto the others. The topmost layer of the system description is expressed in System Modeling Language, a general-purpose modeling language based on Unified Modeling Language. © 2006 IEEE.","Computer-aided engineering (CAE); object-oriented (OO); System Modeling Language (SysML); Unified Modeling Language (UML)","Abstracting; Computer aided engineering; Distributed computer systems; Industrial applications; Machine design; Machinery; Manufacture; Design process; High-level abstraction; Levels of abstraction; Modeling languages; Modeling methodology; Object oriented; System description; System modeling; System Modeling Language (SysML); Unified Modeling; Unified Modeling Language","","","","","","","Booch G., Rumbaugh J., Jacobson I., The UML User Guide, (2000); Douglass B.P., Real-Time UML: Developing Efficient Objects for Embedded Systems, (1999); Karnopp D.L.M.D., Rosenberg R.C., System Dynamics, (2000); Golo G., Van Der Schaft A.J., Breedveld P.C., Maschke B., Hamiltonian Formulation of Bond Graphs Nonlinear and Hybrid Systems in Automotive Control, pp. 351-372, (2003); Van Der Schaft A.J., L2 Gain and Passivity Techniques in Nonlinear Control, (2000); Secchi C., M.

A process will be controlled based on information obtained during or after a process, including metrology values of wafers. Those metrology values, however, are usually available for only a small fraction of sampled wafers. In order to overcome the limitation, one can use virtual metrology (VM) to predict metrology values of all wafers, based on sensor data from production equipments and actual metrology values of sampled wafers. In this paper, we develop VM prediction models using various data mining techniques. We also develop a VM embedded R2R control system using the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme. The experiments consist of two parts: (1) verifying VM prediction models with actual production equipments data, and (2) conducting simulations of the R2R control system. Our VM prediction models are found to be accurate enough to be directly implemented in actual manufacturing processes. The simulation results show that the VM embedded R2R control system improves productivity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Their growing ubiquity has created new problems in how to effectively manage the many models that are now stored in the digital libraries of large design and manufacturing enterprises. Existing techniques from the engineering literature and from industrial practice, such as group technology, rely on human-supervised encoding and classification, while techniques from the multimedia database and computer graphics/vision communities often ignore the manufacturing attributes most significant in the classification of models. This paper presents our approach to the manufacturing similarly assessment of solid models of mechanical parts based on machining features. Our technical approach is three-fold: (1) perform machining feature extraction to map the solid model to a set of STEP AP 224 machining features; (2) construct a model dependency graph from the set of machining features; and (3) find the nearest neighbors to the query graph using an iterative improvement search across a database of other models.

Historically, however, tolerance research has primarily focused on allocating tolerances based on the product design characteristics of each component. Currently, there are no analytical approaches to optimally allocate tolerances to integrate product and process variables in multi-station manufacturing processes at minimum costs. The concept of process-oriented tolerancing expands the current tolerancing practices, which bound errors related to product variables, to explicitly include process variables. The resulting methodology extends the concept of ""part interchangeability"" into ""process interchangeability,"" which is critical due to increasing requirements related to the selection of suppliers and benchmarking. The proposed methodology is based on the development and integration of three models: (i) the tolerance-variation relation; (ii) variation propagation; and (iii) process degradation. The tolerance-variation model is based on a pin-hole fixture mechanism in multi-station assembly processes. The variation propagation model utilizes a state space representation but uses a station index instead of a time index. Dynamic process effects such as tool wear are also incorporated into the framework of process-oriented tolerancing, which provides the capability to design tolerances for the whole life-cycle of a production system. The tolerances of process variables are optimally allocated through solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. An industry case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2005 ""IIE"".","","Constraint theory; Industrial engineering; Mathematical models; Nonlinear control systems; Optimization; Product design; Quality control; Requirements engineering; State space methods; Statistical process control; Dynamic process effects; Multi-station assembly systems; Multi-station manufacturing systems; Pin-hole fixture mechanism; Process oriented tolerancing; Production system; Tolerance variation model; Flexible manufacturing systems","","","","","Arizona State Foundation; Daimler-Chrysler; DaimlerChrysler Corp.; Global Solar Energy Inc.; NIST Advanced Technology Program; SME Education Foundation; State of Texas Higher Education Coordination Board; National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT; Nokia; General Motors of Canada; Bureau of Transportation Statistics, BTS","Funding text 1: Jionghua (Judy) Jin received her B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering, both from Southeast University in 1984 and 1987, and her Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1999.

Henceforth, during both design and manufacturing management stages, it becomes crucial to assess and optimize the overall energy efficiency of a robotic cell by means of digital manufacturing tools. In practice, robotic plant designers and managers should be able to provide accurate decisions also aimed at the energy optimization of the robotic processes. The strong scientific and industrial relevance of the topic has led to the development of many solutions but, unfortunately, state of the art industrial manipulators are equipped with closed controllers, which heavily limit the feasibility and performance of most of the proposed approaches. In light of the aforementioned considerations, the present paper presents a novel simulation tool, seamlessly interfaced with current robot offline programming tools used in industrial practices, which allows to automatically compute energy-optimal motion parameters, thus reducing the robot energy consumption, while also keeping the same productivity and manufacturing quality. The main advantage of this method, as compared to other optimization routines that are not conceived for direct integration with commercial industrial manipulators, is that the computed parameters are the same ones settable in the robot control codes, so that the results can automatically generate ready-to-use energy-optimal robot code. Experimental tests, performed on a KUKA Quantec KR210 R2700 prime industrial robot, have confirmed the effectiveness of the method and engineering tool. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic code generation; Energy optimization; Industrial robotics; Industry 4.0; Robot offline programming; Sustainable manufacturing; Virtual prototyping","Automatic programming; Codes (symbols); Computer aided software engineering; Energy efficiency; Industrial manipulators; Industrial robots; Industry 4.0; Investments; Manipulators; Manufacture; Optimal systems; Robot programming; Robotics; Virtual prototyping; Automatic code generations; Energy optimization; Industrial robotics; Off line programming; Sustainable manufacturing; Energy utilization","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (609391); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement No. 609391 (AREUS).

Similarly, jobs that are completed after their due-dates incur penalty. The objective in such situations would, therefore, be to meet the due-dates of the respective jobs as closely as possible, and consequently minimize the sum of earliness and tardiness of jobs because earliness and tardiness of jobs greatly influence the performance of a schedule with respect to cost. In addition, a job incurs holding cost from the time of its arrival until its completion. Most studies on scheduling in such manufacturing systems assume unit earliness cost, unit tardiness cost and unit holding cost of a job. However, in reality such an assumption need not always hold and it is quite possible that there exist different costs of earliness, tardiness and holding for different jobs. In addition, most studies on job-shop scheduling assume that jobs are independent and that no assembly operations exist. The current study addresses the problem of scheduling in dynamic assembly job-shops (i.e. shops that manufacture multi-level jobs) with the consideration of jobs having different earliness, tardiness and holding costs. An attempt is made in this paper to present dispatching rules by incorporating the relative costs of earliness, tardiness and holding of jobs in the form of scalar weights. In the first phase of the study, relative costs (or weights for) earliness and tardiness of jobs are considered, and the dispatching rules are presented in order to minimize the sum of weighted earliness and weighted tardiness of jobs. In the second phase of the study, the objective considered is the minimization of the sum of weighted earliness, weighted tardiness and weighted flowtime of jobs, and the dispatching rules are presented by incorporating the relative costs of earliness, tardiness and flowtime of jobs. Simulation studies have been conducted separately for both phases of the current study, the performance of the scheduling rules have been observed independently, and the results of the simulation study have been reported. The proposed rules are found to be effective in minimizing the mean and maximum values of the measures of performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This study proposes a multi-agent system framework called agent-based manufacturing control and coordination (AMCC) system, a agent-based framework using ontology and RFID technology to monitor and control dynamic production flows and also to improve the traceability and visibility of mass customization manufacturing processes. The capabilities offered by multi-agent systems to respond to RFID events in real-time and a broad class of agent design and coordination issue regarding just in time (JIT) and just in sequence (JIS) manufacturing processes are also exploited in this study.

The microstructures of the SWCNT-FibSen and its piezoresistive behavior were respectively characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy and evaluated by the coupled electromechanical tensile test. With embedding the SWCNT-FibSen sensor in the fiberglass prepreg laminates at different orientations and locations, its use for multipurpose sensing in life-long (from manufacturing to failure) structural health monitoring of high-performance polymeric composites was demonstrated. During the manufacturing process, the sensor was able to provide valuable local resin curing information. After the manufacturing process, the sensor was useful in mapping the stress/strain states of the host composite under different deformation modes - tension, bending, compression and failure. The integrity of the sensing performance of the embedded SWCNT-FibSen sensor was demonstrated upon a 10,000-cyclic coupled electromechanical test. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To promote a vision of the process industry with efficient, green, and smart production, modern information technology should be utilized throughout the entire optimization process for production, management, and marketing. To focus on smart equipment in manufacturing processes, as well as on the adaptive intelligent optimization of the manufacturing process, operating mode, and supply chain management, we put forward several key scientific problems in engineering in a demand-driven and application-oriented manner, namely: ① intelligent sensing and integration of all process information, including production and management information; ② collaborative decision-making in the supply chain, industry chain, and value chain, driven by knowledge; ③ cooperative control and optimization of plant-wide production processes via human-cyber-physical interaction; and ④ life-cycle assessments for safety and environmental footprint monitoring, in addition to tracing analysis and risk control. In order to solve these limitations and core scientific problems, we further present fundamental theories and key technologies for smart and optimal manufacturing in the process industry.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Business Source Premier, ISI Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, PsyINFO, Scopus, and SciELO databases for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Eligible studies were examined by two independent reviewers for relevance (population of manufacturing workers, outcomes of musculoskeletal disorders, physical factors, psychosocial factors, and strategies used in job-rotation implantation) and methodological quality rating. From 10,809 potential articles, 71 were read for full text analysis. Of the 14 studies included for data extraction, two were non-randomized control trial studies, one was a case-control study, and 11 were cross-sectional comparisons. Only one, with a case-control design, was scored with good methodological quality. Currently, weak evidence exists supporting job rotation as a strategy for the prevention and control of musculoskeletal disorders. Job rotation did not appear to reduce the exposure of physical risk factors; yet, there are positive correlations between job rotation and higher job satisfaction. Worker training has been described as a crucial component of a successful job-rotation program. The studies reported a range of parameters used to implement and measure job-rotation programs. More rigorous studies are needed to better understand the full impact of job rotation on production and health.

Although autologous bone is still the 'Gold Standard' because of its high biocompatibility, it has nevertheless been associated with several disadvantages. Consequently, artificial materials, such as calcium phosphate and titanium, have been considered for the treatment of bone defects. In the present study, the mechanical properties of three different scaffold designs were investigated. The scaffolds were made of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), fabricated by means of an additive manufacturing process with defined pore geometry and porosities of approximately 70%. Two scaffolds exhibited rectangular struts, orientated in the direction of loading. The struts for the third scaffold were orientated diagonal to the load direction, and featured a circular cross-section. Material properties were calculated from stress-strain relationships under axial compression testing. In vitro cell testing was undertaken with human osteoblasts on scaffolds fabricated using the same manufacturing process. Although the scaffolds exhibited different strut geometry, the mechanical properties of ultimate compressive strength were similar (145-164 MPa) and in the range of human cortical bone. Test results for elastic modulus revealed values between 3.7 and 6.7 GPa. In vitro testing demonstrated proliferation and spreading of bone cells on the scaffold surface. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Additive manufacturing; Bone scaffold; Compressive strength; Elastic modulus; Human osteoblasts; In vitro; Mechanical properties; Titanium","Biocompatibility; Bone; Calcium phosphate; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Elastic moduli; Industrial engineering; Mechanical properties; Production engineering; Stress-strain curves; Structural design; Struts; Titanium; Additive Manufacturing; Additive manufacturing process; Artificial material; Bone cells; Bone defect; Bone scaffolds; Cellular response; Circular cross-sections; Gold standards; Human cortical bone; Human osteoblast; In-vitro; Load direction; Long bone; Manufacturing process; Material property; Orthopedic surgery; Pore geometry; Stress-strain relationships; Ti-6al-4v; Titanium scaffolds; Ultimate compressive strength; Scaffolds (biology)","","","","","","","De Coster T.A., Gehlert R.J., Mikola E.A., Pirela-Cruz M.A., Management of posttraumatic segmental bone defects, J.

It implies that we are witnessing the proximity of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Industry 4.0 aims to enable intelligent factories to produce personalized output utilizing greener and more efficient processes. However, to accomplish this, manufacturers must overcome several barriers, such as the lack of qualified talent to develop and manage various high-tech systems. This deficiency means that Industry 4.0 demands a change in the labor market, explicitly requiring trained professionals who have the competencies and skills to thrive in this new environment. What should a set of competencies be in the modern professional profiles? In this work, we review the required competencies, the technologies that aid in developing them, and the methods of assessing them. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Competencies; Educational innovation; Higher education; Industry 4.0; Smart 4.0 Industry; Smart manufacturing","Design; Industrial engineering; Efficient process; Emerging technologies; High-tech systems; Industrial revolutions; Labor markets; Radical transformation; Industry 4.0","","","","","TecLabs; Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, ITESM","The authors would like to acknowledge the technical and financial support of Writing Lab, TecLabs, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, in the production of this work.

The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is adapted to define the SysML-AT (SysML for automation), a specialized language profile that covers (non-)functional requirements, corresponding software applications and properties of proprietary hardware components. Furthermore, SysML-AT supports an automated software generation for run-time environments conforming to IEC 61131-3. A prototypical tool support was realized for adapted SysML Parametric Diagrams (PD) inside an industrial automation software development tool. Coupling the model editor and online data from the provided run-time environment enables direct debugging inside the model. The approach was evaluated by several case studies and additional usability experiments. With the latter, the suitability of the MDE approach for future users was proven. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed systems; Manufacturing automation system; Model-based system and software engineering","Application programs; Automation; Manufacture; Modeling languages; Software prototyping; Distributed systems; Functional requirement; Manufacturing automation software; Manufacturing automation systems; Model-based systems; Model-driven Engineering; Sysml parametric diagrams; Systems modeling languages; Software design","","","","","","","Luder A., Klostermeyer A., Peschke J., Bratoukhine A., Sauter T., Distributed automation: PABADIS versus HMS, IEEE Trans Ind Inform, 1, 1, pp. 31-38, (2005); Rzevski G., On conceptual design of intelligent mechatronic systems, Mechatronics, 13, 10, pp. 1029-1044, (2003); McFarlane D.C., Bussmann S., Developments in holonic production planning and control, Prod Plan Contr, 11, 6, pp. 522-536, (2000); Bonfe Fantuzzi M C., Design and verification of industrial logic controllers with UML and statecharts, Control Applications (CCA), 2, pp. 1029-1034, (2003); Thramboulidis K., The 3+1 SysML view-model in model integrated mechatronics, J Softw Eng Appl, 3, 2, pp. 109-118, (2010); PLC & PLC-based PAC Worldwide Outlook: Five Year Market Analysis and Technology Forecast Through 2016, (2011); Thramboulidis K., IEC 61499 as an enabler of distributed and intelligent automation: A state-of-the-art review - A different view, J Eng, pp. 1-9, (2013); Yang C., Vyatkin V., Transformation of simulink models to IEC 61499 function blocks for verification of distributed control systems, Contr Eng Practice, 20, 12, pp. 1259-1269, (2012); Bonfe M., Fantuzzi C., Secchi C., Design patterns for model-based automation software design and implementation, Contr Eng Practice, (2012); Thramboulidis K., Frey G., Towards a model-driven IEC 61131-based development process in industrial automation, J Softw Eng Appl, 4, 4, pp. 217-226, (2011); Estevez E., Marcos M., Orive D.D., Automatic generation of PLC automation projects from component-based models, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 35, 56, pp. 527-540, (2007); Vyatkin V., The IEC 61499 standard and its semantics, IEEE Ind Electron Mag, 3, 4, pp. 40-48, (2009); Estevez E., Marcos M., Model-based validation of industrial control systems, IEEE Trans Ind Inform, 8, 2, pp. 302-310, (2012); Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML) V2.2, (2009); Goldberg K., Editorial: A secret to advancing research and increasing citations to your papers, IEEE Trans Autom Sci Eng, 9, 3, (2012); Kormann B., Tikhonov D., Vogel-Heuser B., Automated PLC software testing using adapted UML sequence diagrams, Information Control Problems in Manufacturing (INCOM), 14, 1, (2012); Miller J.M., MDA Guide Version 1.0.1.

As a complex solution bundle in both system and product level, its engineering change management differs from the existing ones mainly in two aspects. Firstly, massive in-context stakeholder-generated/product-sensed data during usage stage can be leveraged to enable its success in a data-driven manner. Secondly, the digitalized services, consisting of both hardware and software solutions, can also be changed in a more flexible way other than the physical components alone. Nevertheless, scarcely any work reports on how to conduct engineering change in such context, let alone a systematic approach to support the automatic generation of its change prediction or recommendation. Aiming to fill these gaps, this work proposes an occurrence-based design structure matrix (DSM) approach together with a three-way based cost-sensitive learning approach for automatic engineering change management in the Smart PSS environment. This informatics-based research, as an explorative study, overcomes the subjectivity and tedious assessment of the experts in the conventional approaches, and can offer useful guidelines to the manufacturing companies for managing their engineering changes for product-service innovation process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven design; Design structure matrix; Digitalization; Engineering change management; Product service systems; Three-way decision making","Decision making; Engineering education; Industrial research; Information management; Learning systems; Manufacture; Matrix algebra; Product design; Data-driven design; Design Structure Matrices; Digitalization; Engineering change managements; Product-service systems; Cost engineering","","","","","Delta Electronics Inc; National Research Foundation","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support from Delta Electronics Inc and the National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under the Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme (Ref.

In fact, perishability can influence, for example, productivity or customer service and it may happen to occur in one or more processes throughout the supply chain. In this paper a review on planning models that handle perishability issues in production and distribution is conducted. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, a new framework for classifying perishability models based on multiple process features is presented. Second, it draws the community attention to the importance of managing perishability in many different industries' supply chains by showing its relevance and by reviewing the literature related to production and distribution planning. Finally, it points towards research opportunities so far not addressed by the research community in this challenging field. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Perishability; Production-distribution planning;

Both of these research areas are focused on reducing the costs associated with operating manufacturing processes. In addition, it is widely recognized that the maintenance of manufacturing equipment and the quality of manufactured product are related. However, these two research areas are rarely integrated. In this paper, a combined control chart-preventive maintenance strategy is defined for a process which shifts to an out-of-control condition due to a manufacturing equipment failure. An X̄ chart is used in conjunction with an age-replacement preventive maintenance policy to achieve a reduction in operating costs that is superior to the reduction achieved by using only the control chart or the preventive maintenance policy. This superior cost performance is demonstrated using a simulation-optimization approach.","","Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Economics; Manufacture; Optimization; Preventive maintenance; Quality control; Reliability; Statistical process control; Control charts; Economic design; Manufacturing equipment failure; Operating cost; Simulation optimization approach; Industrial engineering","","","","","","","Cassady C., Nachlas J., Preventive Maintenance: the next Frontier in Industrial Productivity Growth, in Industrial Engineering Solutions ', (1998); Keats J., Del Castillo E., Von Collani E., Saniga E., Economic modeling and statistical process control, Journal of Quality Technology, (1997); Dekker R., Applications of maintenance optimization models: A review and analysis, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, (1996); Valdez-Fiorez C., Survey of preventive maintenance models for stochastically deteriorating single-unit systems, Naval Research Logistics, (1989); Pierskalla W., Voelker J., A survey of maintenance models: The control and surveillance of deteriorating systems, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, (1976); McCall J., Maintenance policies for stochastically failing equipment: A survey, Management Science, (1965); Commanders J.L., Paper to the Secretary of Defense, JLC Study of Depot Maintenance Investment Strategy., (1988); Lochner R., Improved SPC Using Reliability Concepts, in, (1987); Kniele R., Stephens G., Vasudeva K., Performance assessment and statistical process control, An Approach to Operation and Maintenance Cost Reduction, in Proceeding of the IFACj IFORS/IAEE Symposium on Energy, Systems, Management and Economics, Pp. 215-221., (1989); Kalter J., Tu J., Monacelli L., Gartner M., Predictive maintenance of an industrial laser using statistical process control charting, in Proceedings of the 1997 Laser Materials Processing Conference, pp, C57-C66., (1997); Rahim M., Banerjee P., A generalized model for the economic design of A' control charts for production systems with increasing failure rate and early replacement, Naval Research Logistics, (1993); Banerjce P., Rahim M., Economic design of A' control charts under Weibull shock models, Tcchiionielrics, (1988); Zhang G., Berardi V., Economic statistical design oX control charts for systems with Weibull in-control times, Computers and Industrial Engineering, (1997); Zhang G., Berardi V., Economic Statistical Model for Control Chart Design under Weibull Failure Distribution, in Proceedings of the, (1996); Chiu H.-N., Huang B.-S., The economic design of A' control charts under a preventive maintenance policy, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, (1996); Chiu H.-N., Huang B.-S., Economic design of A' control charts with repair cost depending on detection delay, Computers and Industrial Engineering, (1996); Moskowitz H., Plante R., Chun Y., Effect of process failure mechanisms on economic A' control charts, HE Transactions, (1994); Taguchi G., Introduction to Quality Engineering, Designing Quality into Products and Processes, Asian Productivity Organization., (1986); Elsayed E.A., Chen A., Economic design of A' control chart using quadratic loss function, International Journal of Production Research, (1994); Moskowitz H., Pliante R., Hak Y.J., Effect of quality loss functions on the economic design of A' process control charts, European Journal of Operations Research, (1994); Alexander S., Dilhnan M., Usher J., Damodaran B., Economic design of control charts using the Taguchi loss function, Computers and Industrial Engineering, (1995); Bowden R., Bullington S., Development of Manufacturing Control Strategies Using Unsupervised Learning. //£ Transactions, (1996); Biethahn J., Nissen V., Combinations of simulation and evolutionary algorithms in management science and economics, Annals of Operations Research, (1994); Bowden R., Bullington-S, An Evolutionary Algorithm for Discovering Manufacturing Control Strategies, in Evolutionary Algorithms in Management Applications, Nissen, V.

Consequently, a multi-objective dynamic cell formation problem is presented in this paper, where the total cell load variation and sum of the miscellaneous costs (machine cost, inter-cell material handling cost, and machine relocation cost) are to be minimized simultaneously. Since this type of problem is NP-hard, a new multi-objective scatter search (MOSS) is designed for finding locally Pareto-optimal frontier. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, MOSS is compared with two salient multi-objective genetic algorithms, i.e. SPEA-II and NSGA-II based on some comparison metrics and statistical approach. The computational results indicate the superiority of the proposed MOSS compared to these two genetic algorithms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

From the production of life-saving drugs to the manufacture of coffee machines, solvents play a vital role in modern society. Particularly in the chemical industries, solvents are important auxiliaries in processes, and most manufacturing methods require various kinds of solvents. The present contribution gives insight into the adverse impacts of organic solvents and their mitigation, their application with particular emphasis on sustainability, and the new trends that govern solvent design, usage, and recovery. Selection criteria, industrial insights, and government regulations for the most common solvents and their applications are also discussed. The potential of emerging solvents such as deep eutectic solvents, ionic liquids, and supercritical carbon dioxide in sustainable solvent management is highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

When it comes to performance assessment, the elements that allow evaluating the integrated performance of lean and green are still unknown, since each separate system (lean and green) has a specific logic to assess performance. Thus, this paper systematizes the available knowledge about the relationship between lean and green to identify how these practices relate to performance criteria and how they could be integrated into a unique assessment system. To achieve this goal, we applied a systematic review aiming to extract the main contributions and gaps from the lean and green literature. The systematic literature review was conducted in two stages: selection and analysis of the studies. After selecting a set of 65 articles, the paper provides an overview of the literature trends regarding journals addressed, most cited papers, applied methods, and current research streams. Then, through a content analysis of the articles, the paper identifies the performance criteria and practices of lean and green and their relationships. Based on the main findings, we proposed a conceptual framework that helps in understanding the concepts and relationships involved in the lean and green performance assessment system. From the literature review and inspired in the framework, we suggested some possible research questions for further investigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Framework; Green; Lean; Performance; Systematic literature review","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Framework; Green; Lean; Performance; Systematic literature review; Data mining","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (1600604)","This study was funded in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) – Brazil – Finance code: 1600604 .

The manufacturers are under tremendous pressure to dispose of products in an environmentally responsible manner. To this end many companies are establishing disassembly plants and developing product designs which specifically facilitate disassembly. Once disassembled, the items can be reused, recycled or discarded. This paper provides an overview of the research in the area of disassembly of products.","","Computer software; Industrial plants; Laws and legislation; Manufacture; Product design; Recycling; Research; Waste disposal; Disassembly; Disassembly plants; Resource conservation; Industrial engineering","","","","","National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, (60NANB5D0112)","This paper was, in part, supported by the NIST Systems Integration for Manufacturing Applications Program, Grant No. 60NANB5D0112.","Berry B., Environmental pressures drive auto design, Iron Age, 7, (1991); Brennan L., Gupta S.M., Taleb K.N., Operations planning issues in an assembly/disassembly environment, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 14, 9, pp. 57-67, (1994); Brooke L., Plastics recyclability update, Automotive Industries, pp. 40-44, (1991); Chynoweth E., Rotman D., Germany is in the fast lane as recycling gains speed, Chemical Week, 152, (1993); Corcoran E., Green machine, Volkswagon gears up to recycle autos, Scientific American, 266, pp. 140-141, (1992); Field F.R., Clark J.P., Recycling of USA automobile materials: A conundrum for advanced materials, ATA, 44, 8-9, pp. 541-555, (1991); Grogan P., Auto wreckers, Biocycle, 35, (1994); Gupta S.M., Taleb K.N., Scheduling disassembly, International Journal of Production Research, 32, 8, pp. 1857-1866, (1994); Hentschel C., The greening of products and production: A new challenge for engineers, Advances in Production Management Systems, B-13, pp. 39-46, (1993); Jovane F., Alting L., Armillotta A., Eversheim W., Feldmann K., Seliger G., Roth N., A key issue in product life cycle: Disassembly, Annals of the CIRP, 42, 2, pp. 651-658, (1993); Meier B., Breaking down an arms buildup: Dismantling and recycling weapons, New York Times, (Late New York Edition), (1993)","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Comput Ind Eng","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030270858"

By 2000, services comprised almost 80% of U.S. employment. This rapid growth was caused by several factors including changing population lifestyles, deregulation, and new and improved infrastructure including the widespread availability of new technologies. With the service sector surpassing 50% of the U.S. economy in the 1950s, researchers - especially economists - began to examine the characteristics of services and attempt to apply some of the concepts that were developed and proven in manufacturing. From these early efforts there emerged a growing demand for business schools to develop both research agendas and courses in service operations. Beginning at the Harvard Business School in the early 1970s, and continuing through to the present, research and courses in service operations have evolved from simply applying basic manufacturing concepts in a service environment to recognizing the need for a trans-disciplinary approach appropriately suited to the particular characteristics of service operations. This article traces the evolution of service operations from its immediate pre-business school days through its early years as an academic discipline in business schools to the present, identifying ""pioneers"" in service operations who truly blazed a previously unmarked trail that many have since followed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They are based on newly developed mechanically flexible low-loss silicone waveguides. In addition to meeting the generic requirements of rigid waveguide interconnects, several flex-material challenges were mastered: a) mechanical flexibility permitting waveguide flexing down to radii of 1.0 mm without cracking; b) minimization of waveguide curling induced by the CTE mismatch between flex substrates and polymer layers to enable assembly and connectorization; c) greatly improved cladding adhesion on standard PCB flex substrates, such as polyimide; and d) high environmental stability despite the reduced polymer cross-linking required for better mechanical flexibility. The new waveguides exhibit excellent stability in damp heat (2000 h in 85 °C/85% rH) and under thermal shock (500 cycles from-40° to +120 °C), and lead-free solder reflow up to 260 °C. Using the newly engineered 'Dow Corning WG-1017 Optical Waveguide Clad Dev Sample' and the established 'Dow Corning WG-1010 Optical Waveguide Core', we were able to develop a manufacturing process suitable for large areas and offering high process control and stability to produce waveguides having optical loss values of less than 0.05 dB/cm at 850 nm VCSEL wavelength and fulfilling requirements (a) to (d) above. We describe this manufacturing process and how we have overcome the material challenges mentioned. Furthermore, we present characterization and manufacturing results, show demonstrators, and outline the potential of flexible waveguides as versatile electro-optic assembly platform. © 2013 IEEE.","Optical interconnects; optical losses; optical polymers; optical waveguides; reliability","Crosslinking; Industrial engineering; Optical interconnects; Optical losses; Optical waveguides; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Production engineering; Reliability; Silicones; Waveguide components; Environmental stability; Flexible waveguides; Lead-free solder reflow; Manufacturing process; Mechanical flexibility; Optical polymers; Polymer cross-linking; Polymer waveguides; Polymers","","","","","","","Swatowski B.W., Amb C.M., Breed S.K., Deshazer D.J., Weidner W.K., Dangel R., Meier N., Offrein B.J., Flexible, stable, and easily processable optical silicones for low loss polymer waveguides, Proc.

Researchers have not only focused on industrial waste minimization and chemical substitution in processes or products, but also on the effect of product design decisions on the environment during the manufacturing, in-use and end-of-life stages of the product. This research investigates the applicability of Bayesian decision networks to study the impact of design decisions on the life cycle performance, including environmental friendliness, of a product. Bayesian decision theory provides a normative framework for representing and reasoning about decision problems under uncertainty.

Case studies from nine manufacturing companies from five different countries are reported based on interviews with key ecodesign personnel. A literature-derived framework is used to analyse each case, allowing for robust cross-case analysis. Challenges are identified in five areas: strategy, tools, collaboration, management and knowledge. The management category of challenges is the most frequently mentioned by the companies sampled. The tools category is not as prominent as might have been expected given the on-going focus on tool development within this field. The main contributions of the study are the updating of the main challenges for ecodesign implementation faced by industry, and the development of a rich framework of challenges, including new challenges not previously mentioned in the literature. It is suggested that the framework can be used (and evolved) by other ecodesign researchers when developing surveys or questions for in-depth case study interviews as this will facilitate more robust comparisons between studies and support the development of a more consolidated body of knowledge in this field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Challenge; Design for environment; Ecodesign; Framework; Implementation","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Body of knowledge; Case analysis; Case-studies; Challenge; Framework; Implementation; Manufacturing companies; Tool development; Ecodesign","","","","","","","Akman G., Piskin H., Okudan Kremer G., Evaluating ecodesign activities of manufacturing companies in a developing country, 23rd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology; 16th Design for Manufacturing and the Life Cycle Conference, 9, pp. 995-1001, (2011); Bakshi B.R., Fiksel J., The quest for sustainability: challenges for process systems engineering, AIChE J., 49, pp. 1350-1358, (2003); Baumann H., Boons F., Bragd A., Mapping the green product development field: engineering, policy and business perspectives, J. Clean.

Recycled aggregates derived from construction and demolition waste (C&DW) can be used to replace quarried limestone aggregate, usually used in coarse (6 mm) and fine (4 mm-to-dust) gradings. The manufacturing process used in factories, for large-scale production, involves a ""vibro-compaction"" casting procedure, using a relatively dry concrete mix with low cement content (≈100 kg/m3). Trials in the laboratory successfully replicated the manufacturing process using a specially modified electric hammer drill to compact the concrete mix into oversize steel moulds to produce blocks of the same physical and mechanical properties as the commercial blocks. This enabled investigations of the effect of partially replacing newly quarried with recycled demolition aggregate on the compressive strength of building blocks to be carried out in the laboratory. Levels of replacement of newly quarried with recycled demolition aggregate have been determined that will not have significant detrimental effect on the mechanical properties. Factory trials showed that there were no practical problems with the use of recycled demolition aggregate in the manufacture of building blocks. The factory strengths obtained confirmed that the replacement levels selected, based on the laboratory work, did not cause any significant strength reduction, i.e. there was no requirement to increase the cement content to maintain the required strength, and therefore there would be no additional cost to the manufacturers if they were to use recycled demolition aggregate for their routine concrete building block production. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Several modeling samples were then made according to historical records of Chinese ancient mortar formulas and analyzed with the same techniques. The modeling formulas also were used to consolidate loose specimens. The results show that sticky rice plays a crucial role in the microstructure and the consolidation properties of lime mortars. A possible mechanism was suggested that biomineralization may occur during the carbonation of calcium hydroxide, where the sticky rice functions as a template and controls the growth of calcium carbonate crystal. The organic-inorganic materials formed based on this mechanism will be more favorable for consolidating the loose samples both in strength improvement and durability. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the perspectives of static efficiency and dynamic productivity, this paper analyzes the effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance and its internal mechanism from theoretical and empirical levels by using the dynamic spatial lag model (DSAR), mediating effect model and moderating effect model. The results show that: In the whole country, manufacturing intelligence has a significant promotion effect on green innovation performance; The reason why manufacturing intelligence can promote the improvement of green innovation performance is that manufacturing intelligence is conducive to the production of ""technology promotion effect"" and ""cost reduction effect"", so as to promote green technology innovation, then effectively increase the desirable outputs and significantly decrease the undesirable outputs; The effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance has obvious regional heterogeneity: the improvement effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance in the eastern region is significantly higher than that in the central and western regions. In addition, further analysis shows that green technological progress rather than green technical efficiency is the main driving force for manufacturing intelligence to improve the dynamic green innovation performance. © 2022","Dynamic spatial lag model (DSAR); Green innovation performance; Manufacturing intelligence; Mediating effect model; Moderating effect model; Regional heterogeneity","China; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Engineering education; Dynamic spatial; Dynamic spatial lag model (DSAR); Effect model; Green innovation performance; Green innovations; Innovation performance; Manufacturing intelligence; Mediating effect; Mediating effect model; Moderating effect; Moderating effect model; Regional heterogeneity; Spatial lag models; industrial performance; industrial technology; innovation; manufacturing; modeling; technical efficiency; Manufacture","","","","","Key Project of Education Science Planning of Jiangxi Province, (20ZD004); National Social Science Major Project of China, (16ZDA047, 18ZDA047); Research Fund Project of Humanities and Social Science of Universities in Jiangxi Province, (JJ20209); S ocial Science Fund Project of Jiangxi Province, (21YJ28); Social Science Fund Project of Jiangxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72004087, 72064017, 72163021); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20YJC790161)","Funding text 1: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72004087 ; Grant No. 72163021 ; Grant No. 72064017 ), S ocial Science Fund Project of Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. 21YJ28 ), Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Fund Project of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 20YJC790161 ), Research Fund Project of Humanities and Social Science of Universities in Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. JJ20209 ), National Social Science Major Project of China (Grant No. 16ZDA047 ; Grant No. 18ZDA047 ), Key Project of Education Science Planning of Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. 20ZD004 ). ; Funding text 2: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 72004087; Grant No. 72163021; Grant No. 72064017), Social Science Fund Project of Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. 21YJ28), Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Fund Project of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 20YJC790161), Research Fund Project of Humanities and Social Science of Universities in Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. JJ20209), National Social Science Major Project of China (Grant No. 16ZDA047; Grant No. 18ZDA047), Key Project of Education Science Planning of Jiangxi Province, China (Grant No. 20ZD004).","Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., The race between man and machine: implications of technology for growth, factor shares, and employment, Am.

Several aspects can be effective in how meanings are attributed to materials. In this current study we focus on sensorial properties of materials (e.g. roughness, glossiness, transparency, etc.) and manufacturing processes (e.g. polishing, joining, molding, etc.) as effective aspects in meaning attribution. 25 participants were asked to select products expressing five given meanings in which materials predominantly play a role: aggressive, nostalgic, professional, sexy and toy-like. Then, they were asked to appraise materials of their products (1) verbally through interviews and (2) on paper through a list of sensorial properties and manufacturing processes presented by five-point scales. In total 125 products were collected and analyzed. The most effective properties in the overall evaluation were identified. Certain properties were found to be effective in attributing particular meanings to materials.

The simulation model starts with randomly choosing a sphere according to a pregenerated continuous particle-size distribution, and then dropping the sphere into a dimension-specified box, and obtaining its final position by using dropping and rolling rules which are derived from a similar physical process of spheres dropping in the gravitational field to minimize its gravity potential. Effects of three different particle-size distributions on the packing structure were investigated. Analysis on the physical background of the powder-based manufacturing process is additionally applied to produce optimal packing parameters of bimodal and Gaussian distributions to improve the quality of the fabricated parts. The results showed that higher packing density can be obtained using bimodal size distribution with a particle-size ratio from 1.5 to 2.0 and the mixture composition around n 2:n 1=6:4. For particle size with a Gaussian distribution, the particle radii should be limited in a narrow range around 0.67 to 1.5. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Gravitation; Gravitational effects; Image segmentation; Industrial engineering; Numerical methods; Optical design; Size determination; Size distribution; Bimodal size distributions; Different sizes; Fabricated parts; Gaussian; Gravitational field (GF); Gravity potential; Manufacturing processes; Mixture compositions; Numerical modelling; Optimal packing; Packing densities; Packing structures; Particle size distribution (PSZ); Physical processes; Random packings; Simulation modelling; Size ratio; Spherical particles; Spheres","","","","","","","Visscher W.M., Bolsterli M., Nature, 329, pp. 504-507, (1972); Pusey P.N., Hansen J.P., Levesque D., Zinn-Justin J., Liquids, Freezing, and the Glass Transition, (1991); Zallen R., The Physics of Amorphous Solids, (1983); Meakin P., Skjettorp A.T., Adv.

These versatile properties of titanium alloy have caught the interest of researchers and industries personnel across the globe. Further, micromachining of Ti–6Al–4V has become the topic of interest for industrial production and engineering research in the precision manufacturing world due to its wide range of applications in various fields of engineering. However, the machining of Ti–6Al–4V requires in-depth knowledge of machining process as this involves various process variables which influence the machining criteria. Micro-electro discharge machining (micro-EDM) is one of the most successful micromachining processes, and the machined component is free from mechanical stresses as there involve no mechanical forces in the process because there is no direct contact between the tool and workpiece. Also, the specific energy requirement is very low in this process, and the accuracy is very good, i.e., in the order of 0.1 μm Rmax. Thus, in this research paper, an attempt has been made to study the influence of various process parameters on material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate (TWR), overcut (OC), and taper of micro-EDM during machining of Ti–6Al–4V. To perform the experimentation, central composite design (CCD) has been used to design the experiment and response surface methodology (RSM) is utilized to map the relationship between the input process parameters with the resulting process response. It has been observed that RSM models have predicted the process criteria, namely, MRR, TWR, OC, and taper, satisfactorily and can be utilized to predict the response parameters within the range of the parameter selected in the present research investigation. Through multi-objective optimization, the optimal parametric setting for the micro-EDM process parameters during machining of Ti–6Al–4V has been obtained at pulse on time (Ton) of 1 μs, peak current (Ip) of 2.5 A, gap voltage (Vg) of 50 V, and flushing pressure (Fp) of 0.20 kg cm−2. The experimental values of MRR, TWR, OC, and taper at this optimal parametric setting have been obtained as 0.0777 mg/min, 0.0088 mg/min, 0.0765 mm, and 0.0013, respectively. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","DOE; Micro-EDM; Micromachining; RSM; Ti–6Al–4V","Cutting tools; Electric discharge machining; Industrial research; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Precision engineering; Superalloys; Titanium alloys; Central composite designs; Micro EDM; Micro-electro-discharge machining (micro-EDM); Micromachining process; Physical and mechanical properties; Precision manufacturing; Response surface methodology; Specific energy requirement; Micromachining","","","","","","","Boyer R.R., An overview on the use of titanium in the aerospace industry, Mater Sci Eng A, 213, pp. 103-114, (1996); Schauerte O., Titanium in automotive production, Adv Eng Mater, 5, pp. 411-418, (2003); Yoshinari M., Matsuzaka K., Inoue T., Oda Y., Shimono M., Bio-functionalization of titanium surfaces for dental implants, Mater Trans, 43, pp. 2494-2501, (2002); Ezugwu E.O., Wang Z.M., Titanium alloys and their machinability—a review, J Mater Process Technol, 68, 3, pp. 262-274, (1997); Lin Y.C., Yan B.H., Chang Y.S., Machining characteristics of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) using a combination process of EDM with USM, J Mater Process Technol, 104, pp. 171-177, (2000); Rajurkar K.P., Yu Z.Y., Micro-EDM can produce micro parts, Manuf Eng, 11, pp. 68-75, (2000); Masaki T., Kwata K., Masuzawa T., Micro-electro discharge machining and its application.

Here, thermogravimetric analysis is utilized as a bulk characterization method for determining nanotube quality after manufacturing. The application of thermogravimetric analysis for quantifying basic nanotube chemistry is described (e.g., carbon-to-metal content, homogeneity). In addition, extension of the method to analyze specific nanotube properties (i.e., length and diameter) is reported.

The formal requirements of each MCDM method are not sufficient because most methods would seem to be appropriate for most problems. Therefore, the main purpose of the paper is a comparison of accuracy selected MCDM methods. Proposed approach is presented on the example of mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the paper presents characteristic objects method (COMET) as a potential decision making method for use in medical problems, which accuracy is compared with TOPSIS and AHP. In the experimental study, the average and standard deviation of the root mean square error of evaluations are examined for groups of randomly selected patients, each described by age, blood pressure, and heart rate. Then, the correctness of choosing the patient in the best and worst condition is also examined among randomly selected pairs. As a result of the experimental study, rankings obtained by the COMET method are distinctly more accurate than those obtained by TOPSIS or AHP techniques. The COMET method, in the opposite of others method, is completely free of the rank reversal phenomenon, which is identified as a main source of problems with evaluations accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","AHP; Characteristic objects; COMET method; Fuzzy set theory; Multi-criteria decision-making; TOPSIS","Blood pressure; Decision theory; Fuzzy set theory; Hierarchical systems; Industrial research; Manufacture; Mean square error; Medical problems; Water resources; Acute coronary syndromes; Characteristic objects; COMET method; Decision-making method; Engineering and manufacturing; Multi criteria decision making; Root mean square errors; TOPSIS; Decision making","","","","","","","Blair A.R., Mandelker G.N., Saaty T.L., Whitaker R., Forecasting the resurgence of the U.S. economy in 2010: an expert judgment approach, Soc-Econ Plan Sci, 44, 3, pp. 114-121, (2010); Bradshaw P.J., Ko D.T., Newman A.M., Donovan L.R., Tu J.V., Validation of the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk index for predicting early mortality in a population-based cohort of STEMI and non-STEMI patients, Can J Cardiol, 23, 1, pp. 51-56, (2007); Dolan J.G., Isselhardt B.J., Cappuccio J.D., The analytic hierarchy process in medical decision making: a tutorial, Med Decis Mak, 9, 1, pp. 40-50, (1989); Dong Y., Zhang G., Hong W.C., Xu Y., Consensus models for AHP group decision making under row geometric mean prioritization method, Decis Support Syst, 49, 3, pp. 281-289, (2010); Figueira J., Greco S., Ehrgott M., Multiple criteria decision analysis: state of the art surveys, (2004); Garca-Cascalesa M.S., Lamata M.T., On rank reversal and TOPSIS method, Math Comput Model, 56, 5-6, pp. 10-19, (2012); Herrera-Viedma E., Cabrerizo F.J., Kacprzyk J., Pedrycz W., A review of soft consensus models in a fuzzy environment, Inf Fusion, 17, pp. 4-13, (2014); Hwang C.L., Lai Y.J., Liu T.Y., A new approach for multiple-objective decision-making, Comput Oper Res, 20, 8, pp. 889-899, (1993); Hwang C.L., Yoon K.P., Multiple attribute decision making: methods and applications, (1981); Karami E., Appropriateness of farmers adoption of irrigation methods: the application of the AHP model, Agric Syst, 87, 1, pp. 101-119, (2006); Kaufmann A., Gupta M., Fuzzy mathematical models in engineering and management science, (1988); Kim Y., Chung E.S., Jun S.M., Kim S.U., Prioritizing the best sites for treated wastewater instream use in an urban watershed using fuzzy TOPSIS, Resour Conserv Recycl, 73, pp. 23-32, (2013); Kumar A., Singh P., Kaur A., RM approach for ranking of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Fuzzy Inf Eng, 2, 1, pp. 37-47, (2010); Kuo R.J., Wu Y.H., Hsu T.S., Integration of fuzzy set theory and TOPSIS into HFMEA to improve outpatient service for elderly patients in Taiwan, J Chin Med Assoc, 75, 7, pp. 341-348, (2012); La Scalia G., Aiello G., Rastellini C., Micale R., Cicalese L., Multi-criteria decision making support system for pancreatic islet transplantation, Expert Syst Appl, 38, 4, pp. 3091-3097, (2011); Lai Y.J., Liu T.Y., Hwang C.L., TOPSIS for MODM, Eur J Oper, 76, 3, pp. 486-500, (1994); Liberatore M.J., Nydick R.L., The analytic hierarchy process in medical and health care decision making: a literature review, Eur J Oper Res, 189, 1, pp. 194-207, (2008); Milani A.S., Shanian A., Madoliat R., Nemes J.A., The effect of normalization norms in multiple attribute decision making models: a case study in gear material selection, Struct Multidiscip Optim, 29, 4, pp. 312-318, (2005); Morrow D.A., Antman E.M., Giugliano R.P., Cairns R., Charlesworth A., Murphy S.A., de Lemos J.A., McCabe C.H., Braunwald E., A simple risk index for rapid initial triage of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: an InTIME II substudy, Lancet, 358, 9293, pp. 1571-1575, (2001); Padilla-Garrido N., Aguado-Correa F., Cortijo-Gallego V., Lpez-Camacho F., Multicriteria decision making in health care using the analytic hierarchy process and microsoft excel.

To improve this, stakeholders are endeavoring to develop more innovative methods by inter-organizational collaboration. Despite its extensive use by other industries such as manufacturing, little is known of how to successfully apply collaborative innovation to ICT. This paper develops a method for studying the effects of a variety of aspects of existing collaborative relationships for ICT innovation using a combination of social network analysis (SNA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). A set of hypotheses are proposed concerning the expected influence of SNA factors of interaction frequency, emotional intensity, reciprocal exchange, network size, network density, centrality, relationship strength, network position, promotion, enterprise scale, nature and experience on collaborative innovation. Using questionnaire data obtained from a large sample of practitioners, SEM is then used to identify the key indicators involved and the extent of their effects on innovation. The paper constructs a collaborative ICT innovation relationship model in which the strengths of the interaction paths between stakeholders are obtained. With a single exception, this confirms all the hypotheses. Most of the SNA-based a priori hypotheses are shown to be well supported, which indicates the suitability of the SNA concept in developing collaborative ICT innovation. SNA is therefore confirmed as providing a suitable conceptual basis for the modeling and analysis of ICT innovation relationships. From this, a set of recommendations are provided to guide operating companies, designers and contractors in improving their collaborative innovation efforts. The results enable suggestions for enhancing collaborative ICT innovation capacity to be advanced to promote the interaction between stakeholders and the occupation of strategic positions. Although the study is carried out in the context of China's prefabricated housing construction, the methods can be adopted in the broader global community. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative innovation; Industrialized construction technology (ICT); Social network analysis (SNA); Structural equation model (SEM)","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Social networking (online); Collaborative innovation; Collaborative relationships; Green constructions; Housing construction; Industrialized construction; Interaction frequencies; Interorganizational collaboration; nocv1; Structural equation modeling; Social sciences computing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71271065, 71390522, 71671053); Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University, NCET, (NCET-11-0811); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2016YFC0701808)","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 71271065 , No. 71390522 , and 71671053 ) and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University ( NCET-11-0811 ).

These dramatic improvements lead to several benefits such as compactness or small footprint, energy and cost savings, enhanced safety, less waste production, and higher product quality. Because of these benefits, process intensification can play a major role in industrial and manufacturing sectors, including chemical, pulp and paper, energy, critical materials, and water treatment, among others. This article provides an overview of process intensification, including definitions, principles, tools, and possible applications, with the objective to contribute to the future development and potential applications of modular chemical process intensification in industrial and manufacturing sectors.

A fully variational porous plasticity model is modified to include ultrasonic softening effects and then utilized to account for instantaneous softening when ultrasonic energy is applied during deformation. Material model parameters are identified via inverse modeling, i.e. by using experimental data. The versatility and predictive ability of the model are demonstrated and the effect of ultrasonic intensity on the manufacturing process at hand is investigated and compared qualitatively with experimental results reported in the literature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Various industries have shifted toward sustainable technology in order to improve the balance between the environment and social and economic concerns. This manuscript aims to provide a brief review of the development of the foremost natural fiber-reinforced polymer composite (NFRPC) product designs and their applications. The first part of the manuscript presents a summary of the background of various natural fibers and their composites in the context of engineering applications. The behaviors of NFPCs vary with fiber type, source, and structure. Several drawbacks of NFPCs, e.g., higher water absorption rate, inferior fire resistance, and lower mechanical properties, have limited their applications. This has necessitated the development of good practice in systematic engineering design in order to attain optimized NRPC products. Product design and manufacturing engineering need to move in a mutually considerate manner in order to produce successful natural fiber-based composite material products. The design process involves concept design, material selection, and finally, the manufacturing of the design. Numerous products have been commercialized using natural fibers, e.g., sports equipment, musical instruments, and electronic products. In the end, this review provides a guideline for the product design process based on natural fibers, which subsequently leads to a sustainable design. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, an improved harmony search algorithm is introduced to solve engineering optimization problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach, it is applied to an engineering design and manufacturing optimization problem taken from the literature. The results obtained by the new hybrid harmony search approach for the case studies are compared with a hybrid genetic algorithm, scatter search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and feasible direction method and handbook recommendation. The results of case studies show that the proposed optimization approach is highly competitive and that can be considered a viable alternative to solve design and manufacturing optimization problems. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.","Design optimization; Harmony search algorithm; Milling; Taguchi method; Turning","Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Milling (machining); Taguchi methods; Turning; Design optimization; Engineering optimization problems; Feasible direction methods; Harmony search algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Improved harmony search algorithms; Optimization researches; Scatter search algorithm; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Cakir M.C., Gurarda A., Optimization and graphical representation of machining conditions in multi-pass turning operations, Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 11, pp. 157-170, (1998); Cakir M.C., Gurarda A., Optimization of machining conditions for multi-tool milling operations, International Journal of Production Research, 38, pp. 3537-3552, (2000); Chen M.C., Tsai D.M., A simulated annealing approach for optimization of multi-pass turning operations, International Journal of Production Research, 34, pp. 2803-2825, (1996); Chen M.C., Chen K.Y., Optimization of multipass turning operations with genetic algorithms: A note, International Journal of Production Research, 41, pp. 3385-3388, (2003); Chen M.C., Optimizing machining economics models of turning operations using the scatter search approach, International Journal of Production Research, 42, pp. 2611-2625, (2004); Cho K.K., Ahn B.H., A hybrid genetic algorithm for group scheduling with sequence dependent group setup time, International Journal of Industrial Engineering-Theory Applications and Practice, 10, pp. 442-448, (2003); Coello C.A.C., Use of a self-adaptive penalty approach for engineering optimization problems, Computer in Industry, 4, pp. 113-127, (2000); Coello C.A.C., Constraint-handling using an evolutionary multiobjective optimization technique, Civil Engrg.

Recently, conventional process monitoring-based principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to semiconductor manufacturing by quickly detecting when the process abnormalities have occurred. However, the unique characteristics of the semiconductor processes, nonlinearity in most batch processes, multimodal batch trajectories due to multiple operating conditions, significantly limit the applicability of PCA to the fault detection of semiconductor manufacturing. To explicitly address these unique issues in semiconductor processes, a principal components (PCs)-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (named PCGMM) has been proposed in this paper. GMM is capable to handle complicated data with nonlinearity or multimodal features by a mixture of multiple Gaussian components, which is very suitable to describe observations from semiconductor processes. Furthermore, two quantification indexes (negative Log likelihood probability and Mahalanobis distance) are proposed for assessing process states, and a Bayesian inference-based calculation method is further used to provide the process failure probability. The validity and effectiveness of PCGMM-based fault detection model are illustrated through two simulation processes and a semiconductor manufacturing process. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model is superior to PCA-based monitoring models and can achieve accurate and early detection of various types of faults in complicated manufacturing processes. © 2006 IEEE.","Fault detection; Gaussian mixture model; multivariate statistical process control; principal component analysis; semiconductor manufacturing process","Batch data processing; Bayesian networks; Computer simulation; Fault detection; Gaussian distribution; Industrial applications; Industrial engineering; Inference engines; Intelligent control; Multivariant analysis; Nanoelectronics; Process monitoring; Production engineering; Quality control; Semiconductor device manufacture; Statistical process control; Advanced Process Control; Batch process; Calculation methods; Early detection; Gaussian components; Gaussian Mixture Model; Log likelihood; Mahalanobis distances; Manufacturing process; Monitoring models; Multi-modal; Multimodal features; Multivariate statistical process control; Non-Linearity; Operating condition; Principal Components; Process failure; Process state; Product quality; Semiconductor industry; Semiconductor manufacturing; Semiconductor manufacturing process; Semiconductor process; Simulation process; Principal component analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71001060); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China, SRFDP, (20103108120010)","Manuscript received August 26, 2009; revised January 6, 2011; accepted April 4, 2011.

In particular, metal forming and machining (both traditional and non-traditional) have been extensively modeled using numerical techniques. Three basic steps of modeling of manufacturing processes are analytical representation of working principle of the process, modeling of material behavior and method of solution. In this paper, a comprehensive review of various approaches of material behavior modeling has been presented. The material behavior modeling has great influence on the design of process, tools and the final product. This aspect is highlighted in the present review. Metal forming processes, traditional machining processes and non-traditional machining processes are considered for the study. Different material models are compared with respect to their suitability for the design of process, tooling and product.

The advantages of RP methods to produce complex shapes without the use of specialized tooling can naturally be extended to RM processes. For RM to be accepted as a mainstream manufacturing process, parts created by RM have to consistently satisfy critical geometric tolerances specifications for various features of the part. This paper investigates the relation between cylindricity tolerance, one of the key form tolerances, and part build orientation in layered manufacturing. The effect of build orientation on cylindricity error is analyzed by three methods: first by a simple analytic method, second by simulating the manufactured surface using a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file of the part and third by using an STL (Stereolithography) file. The mathematical relationship between cylindricity error and part orientation in a RM process is modeled and critical feasible regions for cylinder build orientation are calculated.

Prospect innovative value propositions (IVPs) emerge in the context of smart PSS. The IVPs analysis plays a critical role in the successful planning and design of smart PSS business model, which includes two key steps: identification and evaluation. However, the existing research rarely systematically explore what value propositions can be identified in the emerging field of smart PSS. Thus, this study conducts a comprehensive IVPs identification through literature review and prioritize these IVPs to provide support for later smart PSS concept design. Compared to other evaluation methods, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) presents higher effectiveness to evaluate the interrelationship and importance degree of the identified IVPs. Moreover, the previous fuzzy-based DEMATEL is feasible to handle intrapersonal uncertainty (individual linguistic vagueness), and the previous rough-based DEMATEL can effectively manipulate the interpersonal uncertainty (group preference diversity). Nevertheless, there are few researches on simultaneous manipulation of the two kinds of uncertainty which may lead to inaccurate evaluation results. Therefore, this study develops a novel graphics-based rough-fuzzy DEMATEL method for IVPs evaluation. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed evaluation method are illustrated through the application in the smart vehicle service system and the comparisons with several different methods. The proposed evaluation model can provide more accurate and informative results, because it integrates the merits of fuzzy set in coping with the intrapersonal uncertainty and the strength of rough set in handling interpersonal uncertainty, and supports to present decision inconsistency along with the final weights based on a proposed graphics-based operator. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy DEMATEL; Innovative value propositions; Rough DEMATEL; Rough-fuzzy method; Smart product service system","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; DEMATEL; Fuzzy dematel; Fuzzy methods; Smart products; Value proposition; Decision making","","","","","Major Project for Aero engines and Gas turbines, (2017-I-0011-0012); SJTU Innovation Center of Producer Service Development; Shanghai Research Center for industrial Informatics , Shanghai Key Lab of Advanced Manufacturing Environment; Shanghai Research Center for industrial Informatics, Shanghai Key Lab of Advanced Manufacturing Environment; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2017-I-0007-0008, 71632008, No.2017-I-0011-0012)","Funding text 1: The author would like to thank SJTU Innovation Center of Producer Service Development, Shanghai Research Center for industrial Informatics, Shanghai Key Lab of Advanced Manufacturing Environment, National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71632008) and Major Project for Aero engines and Gas turbines (Grant No. 2017-I-0007-0008, Grant No.2017-I-0011-0012) for the funding support to this research.

In this paper, the application of a TVA for suppression of chatter vibrations in the boring manufacturing process is presented. The boring bar is modeled as a cantilever Euler-Bernoulli beam and the TVA is composed of mass, spring and dashpot elements. In addition, the effect of spring mass is considered in this analysis. After formulation of the problem, the optimum specifications of the absorber such as spring stiffness, absorber mass and its position are determined using an algorithm based on the mode summation method. The analog-simulated block diagram of the system is developed and the effects of various excitations such as step, ramp, etc. on the absorbed system are simulated. In addition, chatter stability is analyzed in dominant modes of boring bar. Results show that at higher modes, larger critical widths of cut and consequently more material removal rate (MRR) can be achieved. In the case of self-excited vibration, which is associated with a delay differential equation, the optimum absorber suppresses the chatter and increases the limit of stability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A systematic review was conducted to map the linkages between the human-system fit in the design of operations systems (OS) with production quality. A total of 73 empirical studies were identified linking HF to OS performance in manufacturing. Quality risk factors included HF aspects in product design, process design and workstation design of the manufacturing OS. Quality deficits were associated with undesirable human effects of workload like fatigue and injury-related risk factors. Forty-six percent of the studies reported on efforts to improve HF in the OS with effect sizes for quality improvements reaching up to 86%. The paper documents available quality risk factors in the design of OS. It also provides a conceptual framework explaining HF-Quality linkage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Human factors/Ergonomics; Manufacturing design; Production quality","Ergonomics; Humans; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Manufacturing Industry; Quality Control; Workflow; Health risks; Human engineering; Manufacture; Conceptual frameworks; Empirical studies; Manufacturing design; Manufacturing operations; Production quality; Quality improvement; Theoretical framework; Workstation design; conceptual framework; equipment design; ergonomics; fatigue; human; human factors engineering; industry and industrial phenomena; manufacturing industry; occupational accident; occupational hazard; process design; production quality; quality control; Review; risk factor; systematic review; workload; workstation design; devices; industry; organization and management; quality control; standards; workflow; Product design","","","","","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council's; Government of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN 341664); AUTO21 Network of Centres of Excellence, (A506-AWH)","Funding text 1: This research has been jointly funded by the AUTO21 Network of Centres of Excellence (A506-AWH), Canada's automotive research program and by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council's (NSERC) Discovery Grant Program (RGPIN 341664).

Incorporating fuzzy sets in analytical hierarchy process (AHP) ensures the optimality of barrier weights. Whereas, preference ranking organisation method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) helps in pairwise comparisons of solution approaches with respect to each LSS barrier, facilitating fair judgements. This research guides regarding the development of framework and checks its suitability and robustness through case application of an Indian manufacturing organisation. Authors expect that researchers and practitioners will find study useful for LSS and multi criteria decision making(MCDM) domains. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","barriers;

The end goal of QbD is to ensure product quality by building it into the manufacturing process. The main regulatory bodies are encouraging its implementation to the manufacture of all new pharmaceuticals including biological products. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the leading products of the biopharmaceutical industry. It has been widely reported that glycosylation directly influences the therapeutic mechanisms by which mAbs function in vivo. In addition, glycosylation has been identified as one of the main sources of monoclonal antibody heterogeneity, and thus, a critical parameter to follow during mAb manufacture. This article reviews the research on glycosylation of mAbs over the past 2 decades under the QbD scope. The categories presented under this scope are: (a) definition of the desired clinical effects of mAbs, (b) definition of the glycosylation-associated critical quality attributes (glycCQAs) of mAbs, (c) assessment of process parameters that pose a risk for mAb glycCQAs, and (d) methods for accurately quantifying glycCQAs of mAbs. The information available in all four areas leads us to conclude that implementation of QbD to the manufacture of mAbs with specific glycosylation patterns will be a reality in the near future. We also foresee that the implementation of QbD will lead to the development of more robust and efficient manufacturing processes and to a new generation of mAbs with increased clinical efficacy. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Box 8129, Netherlands, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands","As part of a study of working conditions chemical exposure was assessed in 10 rubber-manufacturing plants in The Netherlands. Personal exposures to airborne particulates, rubber fumes and solvents, and also dermal contamination, were measured. To identify factors affecting exposure the personal exposure levels and information on tasks performed, ventilation characteristics and production variables were used in multiple linear regression models. The exposure was generally very variable. The specific circumstances in each department of each plant determined the actual levels of exposure to a large extent. The factors affecting exposure turned out to be different for each of the types of exposure considered. The model for exposure to airborne particulates explained 40% of the total variability and incorporating the actual time spent on a task only slightly improved the model (R2=0.42). The handling of chemicals in powder form was the main factor affecting exposure, forced ventilation having a negligible effect. The model for exposure to curing fumes (measured as the cyclohexane-soluble fraction of the particulate matter)explained 50% of the variability. Both curing temperature and pressure determined the level of rubber fumes. Local exhaust ventilation showed a significant exposure reducing effect. The effect of curing different elastomers was not statistically significant. Dermal exposure to cyclohexane-soluble matter could only be explained to a limited extent (R2=0.22). Tasks with frequent contact with (warm) compound and maintenance tasks in the engineering services departments resulted in high dermal exposure. Tasks in which solvents were directly used explained 56% of the variation in solvent exposures.Exposure data, together with information on tasks, methods of work, ventilation and production throughout a branch of industry, can be used to derive empirical statistical models which occupational hygienists can apply to study factors affecting exposure. These determining factors are of crucial importance, whenever hazard control or epidemiological research is the ultimate goal. © 1994 British Occupational Hygiene Society.","","Air Pollutants, Occupational; Chemical Industry; Female; Human; Male; Mathematical Computing; Models, Theoretical; Netherlands; Occupational Exposure; Rubber; Skin; Solvents; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Contamination; Epidemiology; Health hazards; Industrial poisons; Manufacture; Mathematical models; Occupational risks; Particulate emissions; Personnel; Regression analysis; Rubber products; Ventilation; chemical agent; cyclohexane; rubber; solvent; air conditioning; airborne particle; article; contamination; exhaust gas; fume; information; materials handling; netherlands; occupational exposure; powder; pressure; priority journal; productivity; regression analysis; rubber industry; skin; statistical model; temperature; time; work environment; Dermal contamination; Multiple linear regression models; Personal exposure levels; Industrial hygiene","","cyclohexane, 110-82-7; rubber, 9006-04-6; Air Pollutants, Occupational, ; Rubber, 9006-04-6; Solvents, ","","","Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment","Acknowledgements—This study was supported by a grant from the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment and was carried out in close co-operation with the employers association and labour unions in the rubber-manufacturing industry.

It offers a comprehensive and integrated perspective on the different aspects required to design and implement systems to efficiently and effectively support manufacturing scheduling decisions. Obtaining economic and reliable schedules constitutes the core of excellence in customer service and efficiency in manufacturing operations. Therefore, scheduling forms an area of vital importance for competition in manufacturing companies. However, only a fraction of scheduling research has been translated into practice, due to several reasons. First, the inherent complexity of scheduling has led to an excessively fragmented field in which different sub problems and issues are treated in an independent manner as goals themselves, therefore lacking a unifying view of the scheduling problem. Furthermore, mathematical brilliance and elegance has sometimes taken preference over practical, general purpose, hands-on approaches when dealing with these problems. Moreover, the paucity of research on implementation issues in scheduling has restricted translation of valuable research insights into industry. ""Manufacturing Scheduling Systems: An Integrated View on Models, Methods and Tools"" presents the different elements constituting a scheduling system, along with an analysis the manufacturing context in which the scheduling system is to be developed. Examples and case studies from real implementations of scheduling systems are presented in order to drive the presentation of the theoretical insights. The book is intended for an ample readership including industrial engineering/operations post-graduate students and researchers, business managers, and readers seeking an introduction to the field. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

Uniqueness of the present review work is addressed in terms of analysis on published review articles and their review gap. Research works exemplified between 1981 and 2016 were reviewed in terms of ES application in handling product variety, execution of process planning activities, machining, tool selection, tool design, welding, advanced manufacturing, product development. A statistical analysis was carried out in relation with number of publications, domain-specific area and their percentage contribution. It was inferred that, most of the work focused on ES applications related to tool design and machining apart from execution of various process planning activities. Future research can focus on the development frame-based, object oriented-based, ontology-based knowledge representation in order to develop robust system in decision-making for handling complex engineering problem. ES applications can be extended to field of micro fabrication, machine tool development and integrated system development from design to manufacturing. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence;

But these charts do not relieve the need for pinpointing source(s) of the out-of-control signals, which would be very useful for quality practitioners to locate the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. In this study, a learning-based model has been investigated for monitoring and diagnosing out-of-control signals in a bivariate process. In this model, a selective neural network (NN) ensemble approach (DPSOEN, Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization) was developed for performing these tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the conventional multivariate control scheme in terms of average run length (ARL), and can accurately classify source(s) of out-of-control signals. Extensive experiment is also carried out to examine the effects of six statistical features on the performance of DPSOEN. Analysis from this study provides guidelines in developing NN ensemble-based Statistical process control recognition systems in multivariate processes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This process involves the performance of regulatory tests, such as environmental and safety tests, for the new products and the plant design for manufacturing the products that pass all tests. To systematically address this problem, we consider the simultaneous optimization of resource-constrained scheduling of testing tasks in new product development and design/planning of batch manufacturing facilities. A multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that maximizes the expected net present value of multiple projects is proposed. The model takes into account multiple tradeoffs and predicts which products should be tested, the detailed test schedules that satisfy resource constraints, design decisions for the process network, and production profiles for the different scenarios defined by the various testing outcomes. To solve larger instances of this problem with reasonable computational effort, a heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangean decomposition is proposed. The algorithm exploits the special structure of the problem, and computational experience shows that it provides optimal or near-optimal solutions, while being significantly faster than the full-space method. The application of the model is illustrated with three example problems.","","manufacturing system; performance; Planning; product review; testing method; Decomposition; Drug products; Heuristic methods; Industrial plants; Linear programming; Manufacture; Problem solving; agricultural chemical; Lagarangean decompsition; algorithm; article; calculation; chemical industry; decomposition; drug industry; environmental planning; industry; model; planning; safety; Industrial engineering","","","","","","","Schmidt C.W., Grossmann I.E., Optimization models for the scheduling of testing tasks in new product development, Ind.

In order to estimate the future manufacturing cost for oxide based ASSBs, a systematic identification and evaluation of technologies in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) production has been carried out. Based on a requirements analysis, these technologies are assessed towards their applicability in the production of ASSBs. The most promising technologies are compared by technology readiness using Monte-Carlo simulations. The comprehensive overview and systematic analysis of production scenarios for oxide-based ASSBs reveals significant advantages of established wet coating technologies, such as tape casting and screen printing. However, emerging technologies, such as the aerosol deposition method, could render the high temperature sintering step void. By comparison with SOFC production and adopting learning rates from conventional battery production, an estimation for the manufacturing cost of a garnet-based ASSB is given, indicating that prices below 150 $ kW-1 h-1 at the cell level (incl. housing) are conceivable if the material cost for the garnet solid electrolyte can be pushed below 60 $ kg-1. Based on these findings, scenarios for the scale-up from laboratory research to industrial scale can be derived, paving the way to mass production of safer batteries with high energy density. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Ceramic capacitors; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Engineering education; Fuel cells; Garnets; Industrial research; Intelligent systems; Lithium batteries; Manufacture; Monte Carlo methods; Potentiometric sensors; Screen printing; Sintering; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Solid state devices; Solid-State Batteries; Aerosol deposition method; All-solid state batteries; All-solid-state lithium battery; Conventional batteries; High-temperature sintering; Multi-layer ceramic capacitor; Oxide solid electrolytes; Systematic identification; electrolyte; equipment; fuel cell; high temperature; lithium; manufacturing; nitrous oxide; simulation; technological change; Solid electrolytes","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","We sincerely thank the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) for financial support.

The main advantage of these methods is the great freedom they give designers. At the same time, theoretical and numerical topology optimization tools can be used to simulate structures with complex shapes which exactly meet the mechanical constraints while requiring as little material as possible. Combining topology optimization and additive production procedures therefore seems to be a promising approach for obtaining optimized mechanical parts. Nonetheless structures obtained via topology optimization are composed of parts of composite densities which can not produced via additive manufacturing. Only numerical structures made of full or empty spaces only can be produced by additive methods. This can be obtained at the end of computational optimization through a penalization step which gives the composite densities from 0 to 1 the values 0 or 1. This means that the final part is different from the best solution predicted by topology optimization calculations. It therefore seemed to be worth checking the validity of an engineering approach in which additive methods are used to manufacture structures based on the use of industrial topology optimization codes. Here the authors propose to study, in the case of a simple mechanical problem, that of a metal cube subjected to a given pressure, three procedures, which differed in terms of the code and type of topology optimization calculations performed and the level of penalization applied. The three structures thus obtained were then produced using additive methods. Since all three structures proved to be mechanically resistant, the three procedures used can be said to be valid. However, one of them yielded better compromise between the mechanical strength and the amount of material saved. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Computer aided engineering (CAE); Selective laser melting; Topology optimization","3D printers; Codes (symbols); Computer aided engineering; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Topology; Classical methods; Computational optimization; Mechanical constraints; Mechanical problems; Numerical structure; Optimization calculation; Production procedure; Selective laser melting; Shape optimization","","","","","","","Ponche R., Méthodologie de conception pour la fabrication additive: Application à la projection de poudres.

However, the degradation in the mechanical properties of products made from recycled plastic is a major drawback that limits their use. This study aims to improve the mechanical properties of products made from recycled plastic by utilizing the Taguchi optimization method, instead of coupling the products with additives. By adopting L9 Taguchi OA, products made from various compositions of virgin and recycled plastic are produced by injection moulding. Four controllable factors (i.e.; melt temperature, packing pressure, injection time, and packing time), each at three levels, are tested to determine the optimal combination of factors and levels in the manufacturing process. By determining the optimal combination of factors and levels, the appropriate blending ratio of virgin and recycled plastic can be evaluated from the mechanical performance exhibited by the compound. The effects of the optimal processing parameters and the addition of recycled plastic in various compositions on the mechanical properties and melt flow index of the produced parts are also investigated. The results reveal that the product made of 25% recycled polypropylene (PP) and 75% virgin PP exhibits a better flexural modulus compared to the virgin form. The same product exhibits a 3.4% decrease in flexural strength. The degradation in mechanical properties of products produced from recycled plastic can be improved by optimizing the influence processing parameters during the manufacturing process. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, traditional ceramic manufacturing technologies lack the ability to compete in a market of customized complex components. Additive Manufacturing therefore provides an important contribution, given the nearly unlimited design freedom. This research aims at developing an extrusion-based AM technology using UV-curable dispersions. The homogeneity, rheology and printability of these dispersions, containing 22,5%vol to 55%vol ZrO2 in different commercially available resins were investigated. A sintered density of 92% was obtained, proving the potential of the technology in development. © 2014 The Authors.

The problem addressed in this paper is that if maintenance is a profit contributor how does maintenance technical impact transfer to the plant other activities such as production, quality and tied up capital, and how can this effect ultimately influence company's profit and competitiveness? In this paper, we discuss maintenance role in maintaining the quality of the essential elements contribute in the manufacturing process such as production/operation and quality on the economic basis for achieving the competitive advantages desired. Interactions between maintenance, production and quality, and how simple technical effects of maintenance in the operative level can be transferred to the economic effect in the strategic level influencing company's profitability and competitiveness is discussed. A model describes the mechanisms through which vibration-based maintenance (VBM) impact is transferred to the plant other activities and company's business is developed and verified using real and typical data based on the author's experience in the Swedish paper mills. The main result of this study is developing a model for converting vibration-based maintenance technical to financial impact and assessing it. The model potential and applicability is tested using a combination of real and typical data. The result also demonstrates how the potential of the VBM impact on the production, quality, tied up capital and different relevant expenses can be assessed financially. Furthermore, the model can be utilised for two additional objectives; for examining whether the investment done in maintenance is cost-effective or not, and simulating maintenance financial impact on the relevant working areas in order to assess the investment required before selecting and applying the improvement plan. The major conclusions are; applying the model, VBM policy can be introduced as a profit centre, and identifying the transferring mechanisms of maintenance impact highlights where, why and how much should be invested in order to enhance production and maintenance performance continuously and cost-effectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Their therapeutic efficacy depends on the post-translational process of glycosylation, which is influenced by manufacturing process conditions. Herein, we present a dynamic mathematical model for mAb glycosylation that considers cisternal maturation by approximating the Golgi apparatus to a plug flow reactor and by including recycling of Golgi-resident proteins (glycosylation enzymes and transport proteins [TPs]). The glycosylation reaction rate expressions were derived based on the reported kinetic mechanisms for each enzyme, and transport of nucleotide sugar donors [NSDs] from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen was modeled to serve as a link between glycosylation and cellular metabolism. Optimization-based methodologies were developed for estimating unknown enzyme and TP concentration profile parameters. The resulting model is capable of reproducing glycosylation profiles of commercial mAbs. It can further reproduce the effect gene silencing of the FucT glycosylation enzyme and cytosolic NSD depletion have on the mAb oligosaccharide profile. All novel elements of our model are based on biological evidence and generate more accurate results than previous reports. We therefore believe that the improvements contribute to a more detailed representation of the N-linked glycosylation process. The overall results show the potential of our model toward evaluating cell engineering strategies that yield desired glycosylation profiles. Additionally, when coupled to cellular metabolism, this model could be used to assess the effect of process conditions on glycosylation and aid in the design, control, and optimization of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Within the industrial engineering field, the manufacturing domain has not yet seen a wide application of ontologies. This paper firstly shows the use of ontologies for the semantic annotation of a Web Service-based architecture for the control of manufacturing systems; and then contributes to the research field of manufacturing domain ontologies by proposing a thorough literature review and analysis of the available languages supporting such objective. The paper collects the main requirements that semantic languages must meet to be used in the manufacturing domain with the outlined purpose. In fact, the available semantic languages are several and characterized by different features: the paper identifies the most proper ones for the manufacturing domain representation thanks to their analysis against the main requirements. Lastly, the paper shows how the discussed topics are deployed in a real industrial example. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agostino 1, Italy","The challenge of producing lithium-ion batteries meeting performance requirements and low environmental impact is strictly related to the choice of materials as well as to the manufacturing processes. Most electrodes are currently prepared using poly(vinilydene fluoride) (PVDF) as binder. This fluorinated polymer is expensive and requires the use of a volatile and toxic organic solvent such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) in the processing. Water soluble sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) can be a suitable substitute for PVDF as binder for both anodes and cathodes eliminating the necessity of NMP and thus decreasing the cost and the environmental impact of battery production. In this work, CMC has been successfully used to prepare efficient and stable anatase TiO2 anodes by optimizing the electrode manufacturing process in terms of composition and compression. The stability and the high rate performances of the TiO2/CMC are described and compared with those of TiO2/PVDF electrodes. The compatibility of the TiO2/CMC with a LiFePO4 cathode in a full-cell is also reported. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Anatase TiO <sub>2</sub>; Binder; Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC); Lithium-ion battery","Anodes; Binders; Cathodes; Cellulose; Environmental impact; Fluorine containing polymers; Industrial engineering; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Manufacture; Organic solvents; Production engineering; Anatase TiO; Battery production; Carboxymethyl cellulose; Electrode manufacturing process; Environmentally-friendly; Fluorinated polymers; High-rate performance; LiFePO; Lithium-ion battery; Low costs; Manufacturing process; Performance requirements; Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; TiO; Water-soluble binders; Watersoluble; Titanium dioxide","","","","","Eni","Support by ENI under the contract LiBEST is acknowledged.

These developments have followed a linear economy model (produce, consume, and dispose). As the world is facing a serious threat from the climate change crisis, a more sustainable solution for manufacturing, i.e., circular economy in which waste from the same or different industries can be used as feedstocks or resources for production offers an attractive industrial/business model. In nature, biological systems, i.e., microorganisms routinely use their enzymes and metabolic pathways to convert organic and inorganic wastes to synthesize biochemicals and energy required for their growth. Therefore, an understanding of how selected enzymes convert biobased feedstocks into special (bio)chemicals serves as an important basis from which to build on for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology to enable biobased processes that are greener and cleaner for the environment. This review article highlights the current state of knowledge regarding the enzymatic reactions used in converting biobased wastes (lignocellulosic biomass, sugar, phenolic acid, triglyceride, fatty acid, and glycerol) and greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) into value-added products and discusses the current progress made in their metabolic engineering. The commercial aspects and life cycle assessment of products from enzymatic and metabolic engineering are also discussed. Continued development in the field of metabolic engineering would offer diversified solutions which are sustainable and renewable for manufacturing valuable chemicals.  © ","","Biocatalysis; Biomass; Enzymes; Equipment Reuse; Green Chemistry Technology; Metabolic Engineering; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Sustainable Development; Synthetic Biology; Biochemical engineering; Catalysis; Climate change; Climate models; Coal industry; Enzymes; Fatty acids; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Industrial chemicals; Industrial economics; Life cycle; Manufacture; Metabolism; Sugar industry; Sustainable development; Synthetic biology; enzyme; Bio-based feedstock; Enzymatic reaction; Industrial revolutions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Petroleum-based chemicals; Sustainable solution; Valuable chemicals; Value added products; biocatalysis; biomass; economics; green chemistry; metabolic engineering; metabolism; recycling; sustainable development; synthetic biology; Metabolic engineering","","Enzymes, ","","","Kasikorn Bank; PTT Public Company Limited and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company Limited; Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology, VISTEC; Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; National Research Council of Thailand, NRCT, (NRCT5-RSA63025-02, PHD/0135/2557); Thailand Science Research and Innovation, TSRI","This work was supported by Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology (VISTEC) (to P.I., K.P., D.T., A.P., N.W., T.W., and P.C.), Thailand Science Research Innovation and National Research Council of Thailand through grants: Royal Golden Jubilee PHD/0135/2557 (to A.P. and P.C.), the Mid-Career Research Grant 2020 from National Research Council of Thailand Grant NRCT5-RSA63025-02 (to T.W.), Global Partnership Program from Program Management Unit-B and Royal Academy of Engineering (UK) (to N.W., T.W., and P.C.), and from Thailand Science Research Innovation, Kasikorn Bank, PTT Public Company Limited and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company Limited (to N.W., T.W., and P.C.).

There are many situations in which the simultaneous monitoring or control of two or more related quality characteristics is necessary. Out-of-control signals in multivariate charts may be caused by one or more variables or a combination of variables. One difficulty encountered with multivariate control charts is the interpretation of an out-of-control signal. That is, we have to determine which variable is responsible for the signal. A novel approach for identifying the source of variance shifts in the multivariate process is presented in this paper. In this study, we formulated the interpretation of out-of-control signal as a classification problem. The proposed system includes a shift detector and a classifier. The traditional generalized variance chart works as a variance shift detector. When an out-of-control signal is generated, a classifier will determine which variable is responsible for the variance shift. We consider two classifiers based on neural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM). We propose using subgroup data and some extracted features as predictors. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated by computing its classification accuracy. Results from simulation studies indicate that the proposed approach is a successful method in identifying the source of variance change. The results indicate that the NN-based classifier and SVM classifier have similar classification performance. An illustrative example is given to describe the applications of the proposed methods in manufacturing process control. The proposed method may facilitate the diagnosis of the out-of-control signal. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A series of samples were designed according to the method. Deep penetration tests by the MCNP code were completed. The results show that the designed samples have more advantages related to the radiation shielding effects in comparison with PB202 and KRAFTON-XP3, especially the Cakes with multi-layers structures of the Fe-Interlayer-Pb have excellent performance. Taking into account the ratios designed of components among elements in the material, the manufacturing process of polymer with nano-TiO2 was studied experimentally by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Several samples have been tested. The attenuation experiments on the samples were carried out using tandem electrostatic accelerator neutron source, spontaneous fission neutron source of 252Cf and γ-rays source of 60Co. The experimental results verify the correctness of optimal design and craft. The Cakes are quite suitable for applications in the practices of nuclear science and technology. © 2008 IEEE.","Composite; Gamma rays; Genetic algorithms; Monte carlo; Neutrons; Shielding","ABS resins; Codes (symbols); Gamma rays; Genetic algorithms; Industrial engineering; Neutron irradiation; Radiation effects; Radiation shielding; Shielding; Composite; Deep penetration; Excellent performance; Gamma radiation; High temperature; Manufacturing processes; MCNP code]; Monte carlo; Monte Carlo N-Particle; Nano-TiO; Neutrons; Radiation-shielding effects; Shielding materials; Radiation protection","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (10576022); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, NINT, (200509006); Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, NINT","Manuscript received November 20, 2007; revised February 22, 2008.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption process of AM within a manufacturing system and its business impact. Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted to collect empirical data at two manufacturing case companies in the North West England. Both cases are located in areas of industrial recovery using AM engineering innovation for value creation. Findings - Early findings showed that the implementation of AM caused a shift in value propositions and the creation of additional value streams (VSs) for the case study companies. AM was shown to compliment and strengthen traditional manufacturing VSs rather than replacing them. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the generalizability due to the number and location of case companies included in this research. Practical implications - It is worthwhile to explore the opportunities that AM brings with the existing customer base as it has the potential to add unexplored and untapped value. However, managers need to be mindful of the capability and resources required to put the VS into practice. Social implications - Both cases resulted in skill retainment and development due to the implementation of AM. Hence, the innovation contributed to regional economic recovery and business survival. Originality/value - This empirical research is one of the early field explorations focussing on the impact of AM on VS structures.

Specifically, an explicit conceptual link is drawn between ""generic manufacturing strategy"" that uses two dimensions of strategy (cost efficiency and differentiation) and the complementary production system typology in manufacturing that uses technical complexity and technical flexibility. Proposed production systems are ""intermittent production system"", ""continuous production system"", ""concurrent production system"", and ""degenerate production system"". This paper also expands the area of interest to focus on the development of methods and measures of each technology dimension that can be validated in some way. Thus, this study, by suggesting an integrated framework, clarifies and combines the terms and concepts related to manufacturing strategies based on the results of business strategy research and new manufacturing technology for further empirical study with this framework. © 1993.","","Manufacture;

Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the readiness of ‘Self-X’ levels (e.g., self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adjust/adaptive/healing) is still in the infant stage. To pave its way, this work stepwise introduces an industrial knowledge graph (IKG)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method for achieving the Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. Firstly, an IKG should be formulated based on the extracted empirical knowledge and recognized patterns in the manufacturing process, by exploiting the massive human-generated and machine-sensed multimodal data. Then, a proposed graph neural network-based embedding algorithm can be performed based on a comprehensive understanding of the established IKG, to achieve semantic-based self-configurable solution searching and task decomposition. Moreover, a MARL-enabled decentralized system is presented to self-optimize the manufacturing process, and to further complement the IKG towards Self-X cognitive manufacturing network. An illustrative example of multi-robot reaching task is conducted lastly to validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. As an explorative study, limitations and future perspectives are also highlighted to attract more open discussions and in-depth research for ever smarter manufacturing. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Cognitive manufacturing; Graph embedding; Graph neural network; Industrial knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning","Cognitive systems; Data Analytics; Embeddings; Engineering education; Fertilizers; Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Knowledge representation; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Cognitive capability; Decentralized system; Embedding algorithms; Graph neural networks; Level of automations; Manufacturing networks; Manufacturing process; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Industrial research","","","","","Jiangsu Provincial Policy Guidance Program, (BZ2020049); National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, (SQ2020YFE020182); National Natural Research Foundation of China, (52005424, MHX/001/20); Innovation and Technology Commission, ITC","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support from the National Natural Research Foundation of China (No. 52005424 ), Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme ( MHX/001/20 ), Innovation and Technology Commission , HKSAR, China, National Key R&D Programs of Cooperation on Scientific and Technological Innovation in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan ( SQ2020YFE020182 ), and Jiangsu Provincial Policy Guidance Program (Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation, BZ2020049 ).","Tseng M.M., Jiao R.J., Wang C., Design for mass personalization, CIRP Ann Manuf Technol, 59, pp. 175-178, (2010); Koren Y., Shpitalni M., Gu P., Hu S.J., Product design for mass-individualization, Procedia CIRP, 36, pp. 64-71, (2015); Zheng P., Wang H., Sang Z., Zhong R.Y., Liu Y., Liu C., Et al., Smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0: conceptual framework, scenarios, and future perspectives, Front Mech Eng China, (2018); Tao F., Qi Q., Liu A., Kusiak A., Data-driven smart manufacturing, Int J Ind Manuf Syst Eng, (2018); Lee J., Bagheri B., Kao H.-A., A Cyber-Physical Systems architecture for Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, Manuf Lett, 3, pp. 18-23, (2015); Mills K., What is cognitive manufacturing?

Infrared thermography is a two-dimensional, non-contact technique of surface temperature mapping which can be usefully exploited for quality assurance of manufacturing processes as well as for non-destructive evaluation of end products. Non-destructive evaluation with infrared thermography can be performed in two basic ways: pulse thermography (PT), or modulated lockin thermography (MT). Both techniques are able to reveal material inhomogeneties, which can arise either during manufacturing processes, or in service. In particular, within the MT technique a phase angle value may be associated to a specific characteristic (density, porosity, hardness, etc.) of the material. Thus, MT can be exploited for characterization of many materials either metallic, or plastics, composites, etc. which are commonly used in different fields: alimentary, architectural, automotive, aeronautical, mains. Results prove the capability of MT to discriminate between materials very similar and this feature can be advantageously exploited to evaluate modifications that occur in material characteristics as consequence of ageing, or exposure to adverse environmental conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In manufacturing, the need to produce homogeneous materials has led to the optimization of the formation processes and the understanding of the foam behaviour actually applies to homogeneous material. When applied to foundation remediation, expanding polyurethane foam is formed in the ground under conditions which are less controlled than in manufacturing processes or in the laboratory. Consequently, macrovoids and interfaces are created which result in a heterogeneous foam material. This paper investigates the microstructure and physical properties of expanded polyurethane foam injected in the ground using Scanning Electron Microscopy and physical testing. It is shown that the compressive strength is reduced by the resulting structural heterogeneity and the hydraulic conductivity is increased, but only to a value equivalent to that of a typical clay soil. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the role of top managers and more specifically of top operations managers on the adoption of energy-efficiency practices, based on 5779 energy efficiency recommendations made to 752 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the US Department of Energy's IACs (Industrial Assessment Centers) Program, through which teams of students and faculty from engineering schools provide free energy assessments. Top operations managers possess knowledge of production processes, for maximizing the effective manufacture and distribution of goods. We find that their involvement significantly increases the adoption of energy-efficiency initiatives, while involvement of general top managers without an operational role has little or no effect. Involvement of top operations managers increases the percentage of recommended energy savings that are implemented by 13.4% on average and increases the probability of adoption of more disruptive individual recommendations related to process and equipment change from 31% to 44%. Our findings imply that, in order to advance energy efficiency in SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), it may be advisable to target managers who are sufficiently senior but still in a clearly operationally-focused position. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adoption; Barriers; Energy efficiency; Industry; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Top operations managers","United States; Distribution of goods; Human resource management; Industry; Management; Managers; Manufacture; Teaching; Adoption; Barriers; Barriers to energy efficiencies; Energy-efficiency in smes; Industrial Assessment Centers; Operations managers; Small and medium enterprise; Small and medium-sized enterprise; best management practice; energy efficiency; energy market; energy planning; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; Energy efficiency","","","","","","","IPCC Summary for policymakers, Climate change 2007: mitigation. contribution of working group III to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, (2007); Bernstein L., Roy J., Delhotal K.C., Harnisch J., Matsuhashi R., Price L., Et al., Industry, Climate change 2007: mitigation.

However, because of its low thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity, Ti-6Al-4V alloy is generally classified as a difficult-to-cut material that can be characterized by low productivity and rapid tool wear rate even at conventional cutting speeds. It is well known that tool wear has a strong relationship with the cutting forces and a sound knowledge about correlation between cutting forces variation and tool wear propagation is vital to monitor and optimize the automatic manufacturing process. In the present study, high-speed end-milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with uncoated cemented tungsten carbide tools under dry cutting conditions is experimentally investigated. The main objective of this work is to analyze the tool wear and the cutting forces variation during high-speed end-milling Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The experimental results show that the major tool wear mechanisms in high-speed end-milling Ti-6Al-4V alloy with uncoated cemented tungsten carbide tools are adhesion and diffusion at the crater wear along with adhesion and abrasion at the flank wear. The cutting force component in the negative y-direction is more dominant of the three components and displays significantly higher magnitudes than that of the other two components in x- and z-directions. The variation of cutting force component F y has a positive correlation with the tool wear propagation, which can be used as a tool wear indicator during automatic manufacturing process. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Cutting forces variation; High-speed end-milling; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Tool wear","Adhesion; Alloys; Aluminum; Carbide cutting tools; Cerium alloys; Cutting tools; Industrial engineering; Milling (machining); Production engineering; Speed; Sprayed coatings; Titanium alloys; Tribology; Tungsten; Tungsten carbide; Wear of materials; Cemented tungsten carbides; Conventional cutting; Crater wear; Cutting forces; Difficult-to-cut materials; Dry cutting; Flank wear; High speed end milling; Low thermal conductivity; Manufacturing process; Positive correlations; Strength to weight ratio; Three component; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Tool wear; Tool wear mechanism; Tool wear rate; Two-component; Z-directions; Vanadium alloys","","","","","","","Amin A.K.M.N., Ismail A.F., Khairusshima M.K.N., Effectiveness of uncoated WC-Co and PCD inserts in end milling of titanium alloy-Ti-6Al-4V, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 192-193, pp. 147-158, (2007); Rahman M., Wang Z.-G., Wong Y.-S., A review on high-speed machining of titanium alloys, JSME International Journal, Series C: Mechanical Systems, Machine Elements and Manufacturing, 49, 1, pp. 11-20, (2006); Li J.C.M., Microstructure and Properties of Materials, 2, (2000); Rahim E.A., Sharif S., Investigation of tool life and surface integrity when drilling Ti-6A1-4V and Ti-5A1-4V-Mo/Fe, JSME International Journal, Series C: Mechanical Systems, Machine Elements and Manufacturing, 49, 2, pp. 340-345, (2006); Venugopal K.A., Paul S., Chattopadhyay A.B., Growth of tool wear in turning of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under cryogenic cooling, Wear, 262, 9-10, pp. 1071-1078, (2007); Ezugwu E.O., Wang Z.M., Titanium alloy and their machinability-a review, J Mater Proc Tech, 68, pp. 262-274, (1997); Corduan N., Hirnbert T., Poulachon G., Dessoly M., Lambertina M., Vigneau J., Payoux B., Wear mechanisms of new tool materials for Ti-6Al-4V high performance machining, CIRP Ann, 52, 1, pp. 73-76, (2003); Zoya Z.A., Krishnamurthy R., The performance of CBN tools in the machining of titanium alloys, J Mater Proc Tech, 100, 13, pp. 80-86, (2000); Nabbani F., Wear mechanisms of ultra hard cutting tool materials, J Mater Proc Tech, 115, pp. 402-412, (2001); Hartung P.D., Kramer B.M., Tool wear in titanium machining, CIRP Ann, 31, 1, pp. 75-80, (1982); Cho S.S., Komvopoulos K., Cutting force variation due to wear of multi-layer ceramic coated tools, ASME J Tribology, 120, pp. 75-81, (1998); Bayoumi A.E., Yucesan G., Kendall L.A., An analytic mechanistic cutting force model for milling operations: A theory and methodology, ASME J Eng Ind, 116, pp. 324-330, (1994); Li H.Z., Zeng H., Chen X.Q., An experimental study of tool wear and cutting force variation in the end milling of Inconel 718 with coated carbide inserts, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 180, 1-3, pp. 296-304, (2006); Zhang S., Li J.F., Liu F.S., Jing F., Tool wear in high-speed milling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Key Eng Mater, 375-376, pp. 435-439, (2008); Komanduri R., Turkovich B.P.V., New observations on the mechanism of chip formation when machining titanium alloys, Wear, 69, pp. 179-188, (1981)","S.

Moreover, we describe a 'feature sensitive' metric on surfaces, whose definition relies on the concept of an image manifold, introduced into Computer Vision and Image Processing by Kimmel, Malladi and Sochen. This metric is sensitive to features such as smoothed edges, which are characterized by a significant deviation of the two principal curvatures. We illustrate its applications at hand of feature sensitive curve design on surfaces and local neighborhood definition and region growing as an aid in the segmentation process for reverse engineering of geometric objects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Prompted by these three incidents in North Carolina, Kentucky and Indiana and the need to increase the hazard awareness, CSB is conducting a study to examine the nature and scope of dust explosion risks in industry and to identify initiatives that may be necessary to more effectively prevent combustible dust fires and explosions. Such initiatives may include regulatory action, voluntary consensus standards, or other measures that could be taken by industry, labor, government, and other parties. A critical task of the dust study is analyzing past incidents to determine the severity of the problem within industry. The analysis is focusing on the number of incidents, injuries and fatalities, industrial sectors affected, and regulatory oversight.

The researches on configuration, actuator, modeling and manufacturing processes for soft-bodied robots are summarized. Soft-bodied robots have been designed and built based on hydrostat skeletons or muscular hydrostats inspired by biology. The actuators utilized in them include physical actuators, i. e. shape memory alloys, pneumatic actuator, electroactive polymers, as well as chemical actuators which transform chemical energy into mechanical energy. The mechanical models of soft-bodied robots arecomplicated owing to both material and geometric nonlinearities, so they are mainly described approximately by modeling methods of hyper-redundant robots or experimentation. Processes are divided into three categories: soft robot body fabrication, actuators for soft robots and stretchable electronics. Various new manufacturing processes can be applied to soft-bodied robot fabrication, such as shape deposition manufacturing, laser imaging and smartcomposite microstructure etc. In conclusion, soft-bodied robots are a type of new robot, and research on it is only on the initial stage, involving multi-disciplines such as material science, chemistry, MEMS, hydraulic, control engineering etc. A whole lot of problems in material, design, manufacture, sensor, control as well as application exist to be further researched. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.","Chembos; Electroactive polymer; Shape memory alloy; Soft-bodied robots; Stretchable electronics","Conducting polymers; Fabrication; Industrial engineering; Industrial research; Mechanical actuators; Production engineering; Robots; Shape memory effect; Chembos; Chemical energy; Control engineering; Electro-active polymers; Geometric non-linearity; Hyper-redundant robot; Initial stages; Laser imaging; Manufacturing process; Material science; Mechanical energies; Mechanical model; Modeling method; Potential applications; Shape deposition manufacturing; Size and shape; Soft robot; Stretchable electronics; Machine design","","","","","","","Trivedi D., Rahn C., Kier W., Et al., Soft robotics: Biological inspiration, state of the art, and future research, Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 5, 3, pp. 99-117, (2008); Crespi A., Ijspeert A., Amphibot II: An amphibious snake robot that crawls and swims using a central pattern generator, 9th International Conference on Climbing and Walking Robots, 2006, pp. 19-27, (2006); Li B., Ma S., Wang Y., Et al., Development of a snake-like robot with 3D mobility, Robot, 26, 6, pp. 506-509, (2004); Zhao T., Lin Y., Miao L., Et al., A snake-like robot based on spatial linkage mechanism, Robot, 28, 6, pp. 629-635, (2006); Modular snake robots; Ye C., Ma S., Li B., Et al., Development of a three dimensional snake-like robot perambulator II, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 45, 5, pp. 128-133, (2009); The elephant's trunk robotic arm; Hannan M., Walker I.D., Kinematics and the implementation of an elephant's trunk manipulator and other continuum style robots, J.

Despite the high transfection efficiencies attainable using viral vectors, manufacturing difficulties, safety concerns, and limitations related to targeting and plasmid size have prompted considerable research into the development of non-viral vectors. Non-viral vectors demonstrate low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and ease of manufacture. However, they have not yet achieved the transfection efficiencies displayed by viruses. The inability to explain or predict transfection efficiencies results, in part, from insufficient understanding of the intracellular processes involved in gene delivery. Increasingly, research has been undertaken to probe the processes involved in overcoming the major obstacles to vector-mediated transfection: (1) internalization, (2) intracellular trafficking, (3) escape to the cytosol, (4) nuclear translocation, and (5) gene transcription/expression. This paper reviews and compares the pathways and techniques involved in successful viral and non-viral transfection. In addition, this review provides evidence that non-viral vector development has been pursued successfully thus far, producing systems capable of evading almost all major obstacles to transfection. Evaluating the abilities of non-viral and viral vectors to overcome specific cellular barriers reveals that the greatest advantage of viral vectors may be related to viral DNA, which is transcribed considerably more efficiently than plasmid DNA. Further study in this area should enable the development of non-viral vectors that transfect as efficiently as viral vectors. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","","Animals; Gene Expression;

The ideas, concepts and technologies are not hype anymore - they are at least partly reality, but many software specification and development aspects are still not sufficiently covered, e.g. standardization, specification and modeling languages. This paper presents an Industry 4.0 process modeling language (I4PML) that is an extension (UML profile with stereotypes) of OMG's BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) standard.

Due to the recent development in sensing technology, many on-line signals are collected for manufacturing process monitoring and feature extraction is then performed to extract critical features related to product/process quality. However, lack of precise process knowledge may result in many irrelevant or redundant features. Therefore, a systematic procedure is needed to select a parsimonious set of features which provide sufficient information for process monitoring. In this study, a new method for selecting features and tuning SPC limits is proposed by applying k-fold cross-validation to simultaneously select important features and set the monitoring limits using Type I and Type II errors obtained from cross-validation. The monitoring performance for production data collected from ultrasonic metal welding of batteries demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is able to select the most efficient features and control limits and thus leading to satisfactory monitoring performance. © 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.","Cross-validation; Feature selection; Parameter tuning; SPC monitoring; Ultrasonic metal welding","Algorithms; Industrial engineering; Process control; Process monitoring; Production engineering; Tuning; Welding; Cross validation; Important features; K fold cross validations; Manufacturing process; Monitoring performance; Parameter-tuning; Type I and type II errors; Ultrasonic metal welding; Feature extraction","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-EE0002217)","This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy under Award Number DE-EE0002217.
