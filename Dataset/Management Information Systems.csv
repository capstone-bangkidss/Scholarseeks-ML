They provide guidelines outlining four key steps to construct a hierarchical construct model using PLS path modeling. This approach is illustrated empirically using a reflective, fourthorder latent variable model of online experiential value in the context of online book and CD retailing. Moreover, the guidelines for the use of PLS path modeling to estimate parameters in a hierarchical construct model are extended beyond the scope of the empirical illustration. The findings of the empirical illustration are used to discuss the use of covariance-based SEM versus PLS path modeling. The authors conclude with the limitations of their study and suggestions for future research.","Empirical illustration; Experiential value; Hierarchical construct model; PLS path modeling","Construct models;

It compares firms based on their dialectic learning process. All firms had to overcome knowledge barriers of two types: those associated with the configuration of the ERP package, and those associated with the assimilation of new work processes. We found that both strong core teams and carefully managed consulting relationships addressed configuration knowledge barriers. User training that included both technical and business processes, along with a phased implementation approach, helped firms to overcome assimilation knowledge barriers. However, all firms in this study experienced ongoing concerns with assimilation knowledge barriers, and we observed two different approaches to address them. In a piecemeal approach, firms concentrated on the technology first and deferred consideration of process changes. In a concerted approach, both the technology and process changes were undertaken together. Although most respondents clearly stated a preference for either piecemeal or concerted change, all firms engaged in practices that reflected a combination of these approaches.","Dialectics of change; Enterprise Resource Planning; Information technology implementation; Organizational learning; Process theory","Enterprise resource planning; Information technology; Learning systems; Management information systems; Societies and institutions; Dialectic learning Processes; Organizational learning; Computer software","","","","","","","Appleton E.L., How to survive ERP, Datamation, 43, 3, pp. 50-53, (1997); Argyris C., Schon D.A., Organizational Learning II, (1996); Attewell P., Technology diffusion and organizational learning: The case of business computing, Organization Science, 3, 1, pp. 1-19, (1992); Bacharach S.B., Bamberger P., Sonnenstuhl W.J., The organizational transformation process: The micropolitics of dissonance reduction and the alignment of logics of action, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, 3, pp. 477-506, (1996); Bhattacherjee A., Beginning SAP R/3 implementation at Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 4, (2000); Bingi P., Sharma M.K., Godla J.K., Critical issues affecting an ERP implementation, Information Systems Management, 16, 3, pp. 7-14, (1999); Boudreau M.-C., Robey D., Organizational transition to enterprise resource planning systems: Theoretical choices for process research, Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 291-299, (1999); Boudreau M.-C., Robey D., Enabling organizational transition with complex technologies: Understanding post-implementation learning, (2001); Bowker G.C., Lest we remember: Organizational forgetting and the production of knowledge, Accounting, Management and Information Technologies, 7, 3, pp. 113-138, (1997); Brown C., Vessey I., ERP implementation approaches: Toward a contingency frame-work, Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 411-416, (1999); Computer economics, Annual Information Systems and eBusiness Spending Study, (1999); Constantinos J.S., Supply chain management (SCM) and organizational key factors for successful implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, Proceedings of the Fifth Americas Conference on Information Systems, pp. 800-802, (1999); Davenport T.H., Living with ERP, CIO Magazine, 12, 5, (1998); Davenport T.H., Putting the enterprise into the enterprise system, Harvard Business Review, 12, 5, pp. 121-131, (1998); ERP's Second Wave: Maximizing the Value of ERP-Enabled Processes, (1998); Diederich T., Bankrupt firm blames SAP for failure, Computerworld, (1998); Dornheim M., No kisses for SAP, Aviation Week & Space Technology, 151, 20, (1999); Eisenhardt K.M., Building theories from case study research, Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 532-550, (1989); Eisenhardt K.M., Better stories and better constructs: The case for rigor and comparative logic, Academy of Management Review, 16, 3, pp. 620-627, (1991); Emory W., Business Research Methods, (1980); Eriksen L.B., Axline S., Markus M.L., What happens after ""going live"" with ERP systems?

""Make operational improvements and the numbers will follow,"" the argument goes. But managers do not want to choose between financial and operational measures. Executives want a balanced presentation of measures that allow them to view the company from several perspectives simultaneously. During a year-long research project with 12 companies at the leading edge of performance measurement, the authors developed a ""balanced scorecard,"" a new performance measurement system that gives top managers a fast but comprehensive view of the business. The balanced scorecard includes financial measures that tell the results of actions already taken. And it complements those financial measures with three sets of operational measures having to do with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's ability to learn and improve--the activities that drive future financial performance. Managers can create a balanced scorecard by translating their company's strategy and mission statements into specific goals and measures. To create the part of the scorecard that focuses on the customer perspective, for example, executives at Electronic Circuits Inc. established general goals for customer performance: get standard products to market sooner, improve customers' time-to-market, become customers' supplier of choice through partnerships, and develop innovative products tailored to customer needs. Managers translated these elements of strategy into four specific goals and identified a measure for each.","","Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Financial Audit; Management Audit; Management Information Systems; Organizational Innovation; Organizational Objectives; Planning Techniques; United States; accounting; article; commercial phenomena; consumer; economics; information system; management; methodology; organization; organization and management; standard; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00178012","","","10119714","English","Harv Bus Rev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026494564"

Using data from two qualitative field studies, we argue that in order for boundary spanning to emerge a new joint field of practice must be produced. Our data illustrate that some agents partially transform their practices in local settings so as to accommodate the interests of their counterparts. While negotiating the new joint field, these agents become what we call boundary spanners-in-practice who produce and use objects which become locally useful and which acquire a common identity - hence, boundary objects-in-use. Moreover, we show how boundary spanners-in-practice use various organizational and professional resources including the influence that comes with being nominated to boundary spanners' roles to create the new joint field. The conditions necessary for boundary spanners-in-practice to emerge are outlined and discussed, as are important implications for IS implementation and use.","Boundaries; Boundary objects; Boundary spanners;

Yet from a conceptual standpoint, few empirical studies have made a distinction between individuals' pre-adoption and post-adoption (continued use) beliefs and attitudes. This distinction is crucial in understanding and managing this process over time. The current study combines innovation diffusion and attitude theories in a theoretical framework to examine differences in pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs and attitudes. The examination of Windows technology in a single organization indicates that users and potential adopters of information technology differ on their determinants of behavioral intention, attitude, and subjective norm. Potential adopter intention to adopt is solely determined by normative pressures, whereas user intention is solely determined by attitude. In addition, potential adopters base their attitude on a richer set of innovation characteristics than users. Whereas pre-adoption attitude is based on perceptions of usefulness, ease-of-use, result demonstrability, visibility, and trialability, post-adoption attitude is only based on instrumentality beliefs of usefulness and perceptions of image enhancements.","Adoption; Innovation diffusion; Innovativeness; IS use; MIS implementation; Theory of Reasoned Action; User attitudes; User behavior","Communication channels (information theory); Management; Management information systems; Performance; Research; Strategic planning; Innovation adoption; IS use; Management information system (MIS) implementation; Theory of Reasoned action; User attitudes; User behavior; Information technology","","","","","","","Adams D., Nelson R.R., Todd P., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly, 16, 2, pp. 227-248, (1992); Agarwal R., Prasad J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies, Decision Sciences, 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Venkatesh V., Davis F.D., Modeling the determinants of perceived ease of use, Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 213-227, (1994); Wynekoop J.L., Strategies for implementation research: Combining research methods, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 185-193, (1993); Zanna M.P., Rempel J.K., Attitudes: A new look at an old concept, The Social Psychology of Knowledge, pp. 315-334, (1988)","E.

User-centered information studies have relied on individualistic cognitive models to carefully examine the criteria that influence the selection of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that people make. In many ways, these studies have improved our understanding of how a good information resource fits the people who use it. However, research approaches based on an individualistic user concept are limited. In this paper, we examine the theoretical constructs that shape this user concept and contrast these with alternative views that help to reconceptualize the user as a social actor. Despite pervasive ICT use, social actors are not primarily users of ICTs. Most people who use ICT applications utilize multiple applications, in various roles, and as part of their efforts to produce goods and services while interacting with a variety of other people, and often in multiple social contexts. Moreover, the socially thin user construct limits our understanding of information selection, manipulation, communication, and exchange within complex social contexts. Using analyses from a recent study of online information service use, we develop an institutionalist concept of a social actor whose everyday interactions are infused with ICT use. We then encourage a shift from the user concept to a concept of the social actor in IS research. We suggest that such a shift will sharpen perceptions of how organizational contexts shape ICT-related practices, and at the same time will help researchers more accurately portray the complex and multiple roles that people fulfill while adopting, adapting, and using information systems.","IS research methodology;

Yet, despite a decade of active research and practice, the field lacks comprehensive methodologies for its assessment and improvement. Here, we develop such a methodology, which we call AIM quality (AIMQ) to form a basis for IQ assessment and benchmarking. The methodology is illustrated through its application to five major organizations. The methodology encompasses a model of IQ, a questionnaire to measure IQ, and analysis techniques for interpreting the IQ measures. We develop and validate the questionnaire and use it to collect data on the status of organizational IQ. These data are used to assess and benchmark IQ for four quadrants of the model. These analysis techniques are applied to analyze the gap between an organization and best practices. They are also applied to analyze gaps between IS professionals and information consumers. The results of the techniques are useful for determining the best area for IQ improvement activities. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

They are also fascinating sociotechnical systems in which the behavior of customers and employees is closely intertwined with physical performance measures. In these environments traditional operational models are of great value - and at the same time fundamentally limited - in their ability to characterize system performance. We review the state of research on telephone call centers. We begin with a tutorial on how call centers function and proceed to survey academic research devoted to the management of their operations.

Business enterprises are a dominant form of social organization and contribute to the worsening, and enhancement, of the natural environment. Scholars in the administrative sciences examine questions spanning organizations and the natural environment but have largely omitted the information systems perspective. We develop a research agenda on information systems innovation for environmental sustainability that demonstrates the critical role that IS can play in shaping beliefs about the environment, in enabling and transforming sustainable processes and practices in organizations, and in improving environmental and economic performance. The belief-action-outcome (BAO) framework and associated research agenda provide the basis for a new discourse on IS for environmental sustainability.","Belief-action-outcome (BAO) framework; Environment; Environmental management system; Green; Information system; Innovation; Organization; Sustainability","Environmental management systems; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Societies and institutions; Belief-action-outcome (BAO) framework; Environment; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental sustainability; Green; Information systems innovation; Natural environments; Social organizations; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Abrahamse W., Steg L., Vlek C., andRothengatter T., A Review of Intervention Studies Aimed at Household Energy Conservation, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 25, pp. 273-291, (2005); Ackoff R., Towards a System of Systems Concepts, Management Science, 17, 11, pp. 661-671, (1971); Ahlstrom J., Macquet M., Richter U., The Lack of a Critical Perspective in Environmental Management Research: Distortion in the Scientific Discourse, Business Strategy and the Environment, 18, 5, pp. 334-346, (2007); Alter S., Are the Fundamental Concepts of Information Systems Mostly about Work Systems?, Communications ofAIS, 5, 11, pp. 1-67, (2001); Bakos J.Y., Nault B.R., Ownership and Investment in Electronic Networks, Information Systems Research, 8, 4, pp. 321-341, (1997); Banker R., Bardhan I., Chang H., Lin S., Plantlnformation Systems, Manufacturing Capabilities, and Plant Performance, MIS Quarterly, 30, 2, pp. 315-337, (2006); Bansal P., Roth K., Why Companies Go Green: A Model of Ecological Responsiveness, Academy ofManagement Journal, 43, 4, pp. 717-736, (2000); Barrieu P., Sinclair-Desgagne B., On Precautionary Policies, Management Science, 52, 8, pp. 1145-1154, (2006); Bazerman M., Hoffman A., Sources of Environmentally Destructive Behavior: Individual, Organizational, and Institutional Perspectives, Research in Organizational Behavior, 21, pp. 39-79, (1999); BeIk R., Painter J., Semenik R., Preferred Solutions to the Energy Crisis as a Function of Causal Attributions, Journal of Consumer Research, 8, 3, pp. 306-312, (1981); Berger P., Luckmann T.J., The Social Construction of Reality, (1966); Bertalaffny L., General System Theory: Foundations Development, Applications, (1969); Black S.E., Lynch L.M., How To Compete: The Impact of Workplace Practices and Information Technology on Productivity, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 83, 3, pp. 434-445, (2001); Blevis E., Sustainable Interaction Design: Invention & Disposal, Renewal & Reuse, Proceedings of the SICCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 503-512, (2007); Boccaletti G., Loffler M., Oppenheim J., How IT Can Cut Carbon Emissions, McKinsey Quarterly, (2008); Bock G.-W., Zmud R.W., Kim Y.-G., Lee J.-N., Behavioral Intention Formation in Knowledge Sharing: Examining the Roles of Extrinsic Motivators, SocialPscychological Forces, and Organizational Climate, MIS Quarterly, 29, 1, pp. 87-111, (2005); Bottrill C., Internet-Based Carbon Tools for Behavior Change, (2007); Boudreau M.-C., Chen A., Huber M., Green IS: Building Sustainable Business Practices, Information Systems, pp. 1-15, (2007); Bresnahan T., Brynjolfsson E., Hitt L., Information Technology, Workplace Organization, and the Demand for Skilled Labor: A Firm-Level Evidence, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117, pp. 339-376, (2002); Brown T., Design Thinking, Harvard Business Review, pp. 84-92, (2008); Burgess J., Harrison C., Filius P., Making the Abstract Real: A Cross-Cultural Study of Public Understanding of Global Environmental Change, (1995); Cachon G.P., Fisher M., Supply Chain Inventory Management and the Value of Shared Information, Management Science, 46, 8, pp. 1032-1048, (2000); Carberry J., Using Environmental Knowledge Systems at DuPont, Information Systems and the Environment, pp. 81-86, (2001); Chen C., Design for the Environment: A Quality-Based Model for Green Product Development, Management Science, 47, 2, pp. 250-263, (2001); Cho Y., Lee J., Kim T.-Y., The Impact of ICT Investment and Energy Price on Industrial Electricity Demand: Dynamic Growth Model Approach, Energy Policy, 35, pp. 4730-4738, (2007); Chwelos P., Ramirez R., Kraemer K., Melville N., Does Technological Progress Alter the Nature of Information Technology as a Production Input?

For such systems, firms typically use consultants to aid in the implementation process. Client firms expect consultants to transfer their implementation knowledge to their employees so that they can contribute to successful implementations and learn to maintain the systems independent of the consultants. This study examines the antecedents of knowledge transfer in the context of such an interfirm complex information systems implementation environment. Drawing from the knowledge transfer, information systems, and communication literatures, an integrated theoretical model is developed that posits that knowledge transfer is influenced by knowledge-related, motivational, and communication-related factors. Data were collected from consultant-and-client matched-pair samples from 96 ERP implementation projects. Unlike most prior studies, a behavioral measure of knowledge transfer that incorporates the application of knowledge was used. The analysis suggests that all three groups of factors influence knowledge transfer, and provides support for 9 of the 13 hypotheses. The analysis also confirms two mediating relationships. These results (1) adapt prior research, primarily done in non-IS contexts, to the ERP implementation context, (2) enhance prior findings by confirming the significance of an antecedent that has previously shown mixed results, and (3) incorporate new IS-related constructs and measures in developing an integrated model that.","","Data acquisition;

When those employees find that they are unable to achieve their goals in the current environment, how do they decide whether they should change the composition of their routines or the materiality of the technologies with which they work? The perspective advanced in this paper suggests that the answer to this question depends on how human and material agencies-the basic building blocks common to both routines and technologies-are imbricated. Imbrication of human and material agencies creates infrastructure in the form of routines and technologies that people use to carry out their work. Routine or technological infrastructure used at any given moment is the result of previous imbrications of human and material agencies. People draw on this infrastructure to construct a perception that a technology either constrains their ability to achieve their goals, or that the technology affords the possibility of achieving new goals. The case of a computer simulation technology for automotive design used to illustrate this framework suggests that perceptions of constraint lead people to change their technologies while perceptions of affordance lead people to change their routines. This imbrication metaphor is used to suggest how a human agency approach to technology can usefully incorporate notions of material agency into its explanations of organizational change.","Affordances;

To do this successfully, however, firms must collect consumer information. This study enhances awareness about a central paradox for firms investing in personalization; namely, that consumers who value information transparency are also less likely to participate in personalization. We examine the relationship between information technology features, specifically information transparency features, and consumer willingness to share information for online personalization. Based on a survey of over 400 online consumers, we examine the question of whether customer perceived information transparency is associated with consumer willingness to be profiled online. Our results indicate that customers who desire greater information transparency are less willing to be profiled. This result poses a dilemma for firms, as the cons tuners that value information transparency features most are also the consumers who are less willing to be profiled online. In order to manage this dilemma, we suggest that firms adopt a strategy of providing features that address the needs of consumers who are more willing to partake in personalization, therefore accepting that the privacy sensitive minority of consumers are unwilling to participate in personalization, despite additional privacy features.","Business value of information systems; Consumer privacy; Empirical studies of information systems; Information transparency; Online experience; Online information sharing; Online personalization; Online privacy; Web site features","Investments; Management information systems; Online systems; Security of data; Websites; Consumer privacy; Information transparency; Online information sharing; Online personalization; Online privacy; Web site features; Data privacy","","","","","","","Andrade E.B., Kaltcheva V., Weitz B., Self-disclosure on the Web: The impact of privacy policy, reward, and company reputation, Advances in Consumer Research, 29, pp. 350-353, (2002); Armitage C.J., Conner M., The theory of planned behavior: Assessment of predictive validity and 'perceived control., British Journal of Social Psychology, 38, 1, pp. 35-54, (1999); Awad N.F., Krishnan M.S., Price dispersion and online information: Quality or quantity?, University of Michigan Business School Working Paper, (2002); Azjen I., Driver B.L., Prediction of leisure participation from behavioral, normative, and control beliefs: An application of the theory of planned behavior, Leisure Sciences, 13, 3, pp. 185-204, (1991); Azjen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Bagozzi R.P., Causal Models in Marketing, (1980); Barwise P., Strong C., Permission-based mobile advertising, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 16, 1, pp. 14-24, (2002); Bates A.P., Privacy, a useful concept?, Social Forces, 42, 4, pp. 430-434, (1964); Bentler P.M., EQS: Structural Equations Program Manual, (1989); Blau P., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Browne M.W., Cudeck R., Alternative ways of assessing model fit, Testing Structural Equation Models, pp. 136-162, (1993); Campbell D., Fiske D., Convergent and discriminant validity by the multitrait-multimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 56, 2, pp. 81-105, (1959); Chellappa R.K., Sin R., Personalization versus privacy: An empirical examination of the online consumer's dilemma, Information Technology and Management, 6, 2-3, pp. 181-202, (2005); Cranor L.F., Reagle J., Ackemian M.S., Beyond concern: Understanding net users' attitudes about online privacy, AT&T Labs Research Technical Report TR 99.4.3, (1999); Culnan M.J., How did they get my name?

To make more informed decisions and to meet the challenge of developing systems that satisfy these demands, system developers need to achieve a better understanding of factors that ultimately lead to system usage. To enhance this understanding, we posit a holistic framework to examine several constructs suggested in the literature that lead to the behavioral intention to use an information system. Our framework includes situational involvement, intrinsic involvement, argument for change, perceived usefulness, ease of use, prior usage, and attitude constructs. We extend the Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is founded on the Theory of Reasoned Action. A diverse sample from industry is used to test our model. Structural equation modeling is used to examine the entire pattern of intercorrelations among the constructs and to test related propositions. A hierarchical structure is used to compare the explanatory ability of TAM with our extension. Our model explains a large portion of the covariance among the constructs that lead to a user's behavioral intention to use an information system and compares favorably with TAM. The results indicate that (1) the direct effect of situational involvement on behavioral intention as well as attitude is significant in the negative direction, (2) attitude seems to play a mediating role, and (3) intrinsic involvement plays a significant role in shaping perceptions. Finally, we conclude that the user involvement construct needs to be separated into its psychological as well as its participative components for developers to understand its impact on the systems development process.","Behavioral intention; Involvement; Management information systems; Systems development","","","","","","","","Adams D.A., Nelson R.R., Todd P., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly, 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Aspler R., Sears D.O., Warning personal involvement and attitude change, Journal of Personality and Psychology, 9, 4, pp. 162-166, (1968); Bagozzi R.P., A field investigation of causal relations among cognitions, affect, intentions, and behavior, Journal of Marketing Research, 19, NOV., pp. 562-584, (1982); Barki H., Hartwick J., Rethinking the concept of user involvement, MIS Quarterly, 13, 1, pp. 53-63, (1989); Barki H., Hartwick J., Measuring user participation, user involvement, and user attitude, MIS Quarterly, 18, 1, pp. 59-79, (1994); Baroudi J.J., Olson M.H., Ives B., An empirical study of the impact of user involvement on system usage and information satisfaction, Communications of the ACM, 29, 3, pp. 232-238, (1986); Beardon W.O., Sharma S., Teel J., Sample size effects on chi-square and other statistics used in evaluating causal models, Journal of Marketing Research, 16, NOV., pp. 425-430, (1982); Benbasat I., Dexter A.S., Todd P., An experimental program investigating color-enhanced and graphical information presentation: An integration of the findings, Communications of the ACM, 29, 11, pp. 1094-1105, (1986); Bentler P.M., Bonett D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, 3, pp. 588-606, (1980); Bentler P.M., Bonett D.G., Comparative fit indices in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, pp. 238-246, (1990); Boomsma A., Nonconvergence, improper solutions, and starting values in LISREL maximum likelihood estimation, Psychometrica, 50, 2, pp. 229-242, (1985); Brinberg D., An examination of the determinants of intention and behavior: A comparison of two models, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 9, 6, pp. 560-575, (1979); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminate validation by the multimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 56, 2, pp. 81-105, (1959); Carmines E.G., McIver J.P., Analyzing models with unobserved variables: Analysis of covariance structures, Social Measurement: Current Issues, (1981); Celsi R.L., Chow S., Olson J.C., Walker B.A., The construct validity of intrinsic sources of personal relevance: An intra-individual source of felt involvement, Journal of Business Research, 25, 2, pp. 165-185, (1992); Chaiken S., Stangor C., Attitude and attitude change, Annual Review of Psychology, 38, pp. 575-630, (1987); Davis F., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Davis F., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); DeSanctis G., Expectancy theory as an explanation of voluntary use of a decision support system, Psychological Reports, 52, pp. 247-261, (1983); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research, (1975); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Franz C.R., Robey D., Organizational contest, user involvement, and the usefulness of information system, Decision Sciences, 17, 3, pp. 329-356, (1986); Fredricks A.J., Dossett D.L., Attitude-behavior relations: A comparison of the Fishbein-Ajzen and the Bentler-Speckart models, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, 3, pp. 501-512, (1983); Ginzberg M.J., Early diagnosis of MIS implementation failure: Promising results and unanswered questions, Management Science, 27, 4, pp. 459-478, (1981); Hair J.F.

Media synchronicity theory (MST) focuses on the ability of media to support synchronicity, a shared pattern of coordinated behavior among individuals as they work together. We expand on the original propositions of MST to argue that communication is composed of two primary processes: conveyance and convergence. The familiarity of individuals with the tasks they are performing and with their coworkers will also affect the relative amounts of these two processes. Media synchronicity theory proposes that for conveyance processes, use of media supporting lower synchronicity should result in better communication performance. For convergence processes, use of media supporting higher synchronicity should result in better communication performance. We identify five capabilities of media (symbol sets, parallelism, transmission velocity, rehearsability, and reprocessability) that Influence the development of synchronicity and thus the successful performance of conveyance and convergence communication processes. The successful completion of most tasks involving more than one individual requires both conveyance and convergence processes, thus communication performance will be improved when individuals use a variety of media to perform a task, rather than just one medium.","Collaboration technology; Communication; Convergence; Conveyance; Media capabilities; Media richness; Media theory","Communication; Collaboration technology; Convergence; Conveyance; Media capabilities; Media richness; Media theory; Management information systems","","","","","","","Ahituv N., Igbaria M., Sella A., The Effects of Time Pressure and Completeness of Information on Decision Making, Journal of Management Information Systems, 15, 2, pp. 153-172, (1998); Bales R.F., A Set of Categories for the Analysis of Small Group Interaction, American Sociological Review, 15, pp. 257-263, (1950); Ballard D.I., Seibold D.R., Communication-Related Organizational Structures and Work Group Temporal Experiences: The Effects of Coordination Method, Technology Type, and Feedback Cycle on Members' Construals and Enactments of Time, Communication Monographs, 71, 1, pp. 1-27, (2004); Berlo D.K., The Process of Communication, (1960); Boje D.M., The Story-Telling Organization: A Study of Story Performance in an Office Supply Firm, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, pp. 106-126, (1991); Bretz R., Media for Interactive Communication, (1983); Burgoon J.K., Bonito J.A., Bengtsson B., Ramirez Jr. A., Dunbar N.E., Miczo N., Testing the Interactivity Model: Communication Processes, Partner Assessments, and the Quality of Collaborative Work, Journal of Management Information Systems, 16, 3, pp. 33-56, (1999); Burke K., Chidambaram L., How Much Bandwidth Is Enough?

In particular, it offers only partial explanations of why different concerns emerge, how they manifest, and how firms can manage them. In response, we present a longitudinal case study of Volvo Cars'connected car initiative. Combining extant literature with insights from the case, we argue that incumbent firms face four competing concerns-capability (existing versus requisite), focus (product versus process), collaboration (internal versus external), and governance (control versus flexibility)- and that these concerns are systemically interrelated. Firms must therefore manage these concerns cohesively by continuously balancing new opportunities and established practices.","Competing concerns; Digital innovation; Incumbent firms","Competing concerns; Digital innovations; Incumbent firms; Longitudinal case study; Management information systems","","","","","","","Alexander C., The origins of pattern theory, IEEE Software, 16, 5, pp. 71-82, (1999); Anderson P., Tushman M., Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical model of technological change, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 4, pp. 604-633, (1990); Andersson M., Lindgren R., The mobile-stationary divide in ubiquitous computing environments: Lessons from the transport industry, Information Systems Management, 22, 4, pp. 65-79, (2005); Andersson M., Lindgren R., Henfridsson O., Architectural knowledge in inter-organizational IT innovation, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 17, 1, pp. 19-38, (2008); Ansari S., Garud R., Kumaraswamy A., The disruptor's dilemma: TiVo and the U.

Under QR, the retailer has the ability to adjust orders based on better demand information. We study how a manufacturer-retailer channel impacts choices of production and marketing variables under QR in the apparel industry. Specifically, we build formal models of the inventory decisions of manufacturers and retailers both before and after QR. Our models allow us to address who wins and who loses under QR, and suggest actions such as service level, wholesale price and volume commitments that can be used to make QR profitable for both members of the channel, i.e., Pareto improving. Detailed discussions with a major retailer, and information from industry sources provide supporting evidence for the structure and conclusions of the model.","Bayesian Models; Channels; Inventory; Lead Time; Service Level","Decision making; Industrial management; Management information systems; Marketing; Mathematical models; Production; Apparel industry; Manufacturer retailer channel; Quick response; Management science","","","","","","","Barrett G., Changing Measures of Performance, Proc.

Organizational information processing theory states that performance is influenced by the level of fit between information processing mechanisms and organizational context. Two important elements of this context are interdependence and differentiation among subunits of the organization. Because ERP systems include data and process integration, the theory suggests that ERP will be a relatively better fit when interdependence is high and differentiation is low. Our model focuses at the subunit level of the organization (business function or location, such as a manufacturing plant) and includes intermediate benefits through which ERP's overall subunit impact occurs (in our case at the plant level). ERP customization and the amount of time since ERP implementation are also included in the model. The resulting causal model is tested using a questionnaire survey of 111 manufacturing plants. The data support the key assertions in the model.","Data integration; Differentiation; Enterprise systems; ERP; Interdependence; Manufacturing planning and control; Organizational information processing theory","Data processing;

Among the diverse theories employed to help understand this is task technology fit (TTF), which considers the needed technological characteristics of the task as a major factor determining usage. This theory, however, ignores the personal cognition dimension, which has been found to affect the use of an IS. By integrating TTF and social cognitive theory (SCT), we attempted to determine the key factors affecting KMS usage in IT, the organizational task, and personal cognition. Through a survey of 192 KMS users, task interdependence, perceived task technology fit, KMS self-efficacy, and personal outcome expectations were found to have substantial influences on KMS usage. Among the key factors, KMS self-efficacy was found to be especially important as it was substantially and positively correlated to perceived task technology fit, personal and performance-related outcome expectations, and KMS usage. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A recent survey shows that ""Improve IT quality"" is one of the top concerns facing IT executives. As IT quality is a multidimensional measure, it is important to determine what aspects of IT quality are critical to organizations to help Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to devise effective IT quality improvement strategies. In this research, we model the relationship between information systems' (IS) quality and organizational impact. We hypothesize greater organizational impact in situations in which system quality, information quality and service quality are high. We also hypothesize a positive relationship between system quality and information quality. We test our hypotheses using survey data. Our structural equation model exhibits a good fit with the observed data. Our results show that IS service quality is the most influential variable in this model (followed by information quality and system quality), thus highlighting the importance of IS service quality for organizational performance. This paper contributes theoretically to IS success models through the system quality-to-information quality and IS quality-to-organizational impact links. Implications of our results for practice and research are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an empirical study that examines the extent to which IT impacts customer service. More specifically, this study investigates the differential effects of various IT resources and capabilities on the performance of the customer service process across firms that compete in the North American life and health insurance industry. The paper builds on (1) information systems work that suggests that the effects of IT are best documented at the level of processes within a firm, (2) information systems work that suggests that the performance effects of IT are likely to be contingent in nature, and (3) developments in the resource-based view, which describes the kinds of IT resources and capabilities that are likely to enable a process in one firm to outperform the same process in competing firms. The findings suggest that tacit, socially complex, firm-specific resources explain variation in process performance across firms and that IT resources and capabilities without these attributes do not. Of particular interest to IS scholars, it is found that shared knowledge between IT and customer service units - an important driver of how IT is implemented and used in the customer service process - is a key IT capability that affects customer service process performance and moderates the impacts of explicit IT resources such as the generic information technologies used in the process and IT spending, which - consistent with resource-based predictions - were not found to be directly and positively associated with relative process performance. The implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.","Business processes; Business value of IT; IT resources and capabilities; Process performance; Resource-based theory; Shared knowledge","Customer satisfaction;

This study focuses on further conceptual development of this important belief in technology acceptance. Unlike much prior research that has focused on only a limited aspect of compatibility, we provide a more comprehensive conceptual definition that disaggregates the content of compatibility into four distinct and separable constructs: compatibility with preferred work style, compatibility with existing work practices, compatibility with prior experience, and compatibility with values. We suggest that the form of the multidimensional compatibility construct is best modeled as a multivariate structural model. Based on their conceptual definitions, we develop operational measures for the four compatibility variables. We assess the nomological validity of our conceptualization by situating it within the technology acceptance model. In contrast to prior research, which has regarded beliefs of compatibility as an independent antecedent of technology acceptance outcomes, we posit causal linkages not only among the four compatibility beliefs, but also between compatibility beliefs and usefulness, and ease of use. We test our theoretical model with afield sample of 278 users of a customer relationship management system in the context of a large bank. Scale validation indicates that the operational measures of compatibility developed in this study have acceptable psychometric properties, which support the existence of four distinct constructs. Results largely support the theorized relationships.","Compatibility; Innovation characteristics; Innovation diffusion; TAM; Technology acceptance model","Customer satisfaction; Industrial research; Management information systems;

This permits it to adapt to evolutionary changes in the system being managed and to new application requirements. Changing the behavior of automated managers can be achieved by changing the policy without having to reimplement them—this permits the reuse of the managers in different environments. It is also useful to have a clear specification of the policy applying to human managers in an enterprise. This paper describes the work on policy which has come out of two related ESPRIT funded projects, SysMan and IDSM. Two classes of policy are elaborated—authorization policies define what a manager is permitted to do and obligation policies define what a manager must do. Policies are specified as objects which define a relationship between subjects (managers) and targets (managed objects). Domains are used to group the objects to which a policy applies. Policy objects also have attributes specifying the action to be performed and constraints limiting the applicability of the policy. We show how a number of example policies can be modeled using these objects and briefly mention issues relating to policy hierarchy and conflicts between overlapping policies. © 1994, Plenum Publishing Corporation.

A virtual store allows companies to provide product information and offer direct sales to their customers through an electronic channel. The fundamental problem motivating this study is that: in order for a virtual store to compete effectively with both physical stores and other online retailers, there is an urgent need to understand the factors that entice consumers to use it. This research attempted to provide both theoretical and empirical analyses to explain consumers' use of a virtual store and its antecedents. By applying the technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), this research took an extended perspective to examine consumer behavior in the virtual store context. The data from a survey of online consumers was used empirically to test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to evaluate the causal model. The implication of the work to both researchers and practitioners is discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While investments in IT continue to made for both efficiency and effectiveness purposes, the SIS era is premised on management proactively seeking out opportunities for competitive advantage through IT, with approaches to information systems (IS) strategy formulation accommodating the requirement for both alignment of IS/IT investments with corporate strategy and assessing the disruptive impact of technology and the options for its use in shaping business strategy. Frameworks, methodologies and tools have been developed to support the objectives of the SIS era, yet the mechanisms through which organizations achieve repeated and sustained value from IT has received scant attention. Drawing on resource-based theory, this paper proposes a perspective on the management of IT in organizations that specifically considers how organizations can continuously derive and leverage value through IT. The analysis moves beyond a focus on identifying 'strategic systems' and develops the concept of an IS capability, suggesting that it heralds the arrival of a new era. The paper presents a model of an IS capability, outlines its core components and illustrates its application. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The literature suggests a complex relationship between management support and implementation success. However, the empirical literature typically hypothesizes and tests a simple main-effects model. Drawing upon the role of the institutional context and metastructuratlon actions, we propose a contingent model in which task interdependence moderates the effect of management support on implementation success. A meta-analysis of the empirical literature provides strong support for the model and begins to explain the wide variance in empirical findings.

A central task in developing such theories is to uncover the generative mechanisms by which IT is implicated in organizational change processes, but to do so, we must explain how critical realism's concept of generative mechanisms applies in an IS context. Similarly, convincing arguments have been made for using Gibson's (1986) affordance theory from ecological psychology for developing theories of IT-associated organizational change, but this effort has been hampered due to insufficient attention to the ontological status of affordances. In this paper, we argue that affordances are the generative mechanisms we need to specify and explain how affordances are a specific type of generative mechanism. We use the core principles of critical realism to argue how affordances arise in the real domain from the relation between the complex assemblages of organizations and of IT artifacts, how affordances are actualized over time by organizational actors, and how these actualizations lead to the various effects we observe in the empirical domain. After presenting these arguments, we reanalyze two published cases in the literature, those of ACRO and Autoworks, to illustrate how affordance-based theories informed by critical realism enhance our ability to explain IT-associated organizational change. These examples show how researchers using this approach should proceed, and how managers can use these ideas to diagnose and address IT implementation problems.","Affordance; Case study; Critical realism; Generative mechanism; Organizational change","Affordance theories; Affordance-based theory; Affordances; Critical realisms; Ecological psychology; Generative mechanism; Organizational actors; Organizational change; Management information systems","","","","","","","Archer M.S., Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach, (1995); Bhaskar R., Plato Etc., (1994); Bhaskar R., General introduction, Critical Realism: Essential Readings, (1998); Bhaskar R., Philosophy and scientific realism, Critical Realism: Essential Readings, pp. 16-47, (1998); Bygstad B., Generative mechanisms for innovation in information infrastructures, Information and Organization, 20, 3-4, pp. 156-168, (2010); Carter B., New C., Making Realism Work: Realist Social Theory and Empirical Research, (2004); Chemero A., An outline of a theory of affordances, Ecological Psychology, 15, 2, pp. 181-195, (2003); Coleman J.S., Social theory, social research, and a theory of action, American Journal of Sociology, 91, 6, pp. 1309-1335, (1986); Danermark B., Ekstrom M., Jakobsen L., Karlsson J.C., Explaining Society, (2002); Delanda M., A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity, (2006); Demetriou C., The realist approach to explanatory mechanisms in social science, Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 39, 3, pp. 440-462, (2009); Dobson P.J., The philosophy of critical realism: An opportunity for information systems research, Information Systems Frontiers, 3, 2, pp. 199-210, (2001); Elder-Vass D., Emergence and the realist account of cause, Journal of Critical Realism, 4, 2, pp. 315-338, (2005); Elder-Vass D., For emergence: Refining archer's account of social structure, Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 37, 1, pp. 25-44, (2007); Elder-Vass D., The Causal Power of Social Structures, (2010); Elmes M.B., Strong D.M., Volkoff O., Panoptic empowerment and reflective conformity in enterprise systems- enabled organizations, Information and Organization, 15, 1, pp. 1-37, (2005); Fayard A.-L., Weeks J., Photocopiers and water- coolers: The affordances of informal interaction, Organization Studies, 28, 5, pp. 605-634, (2007); Fleetwood S., Ontology in organization and management studies: A critical realist perspective, Organization, 12, 2, pp. 197-222, (2005); Fleetwood S., Powers and tendencies revisited, Journal of Critical Realism, 10, 1, pp. 80-99, (2011); Gambetta D., Concatenations of mechanisms, Social Mechanisms, pp. 102-124, (1998); Gibson J.J., The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception, (1986); Hedstrom P., Swedberg R., Social mechanisms, Acta Sociologica, 39, 3, pp. 281-308, (1996); Hedstrom P., Swedberg R., Social mechanisms: An introductory essay, Social Mechanisms, pp. 1-31, (1998); Hedstrom P., Ylikoski P., Causal mechanisms in the social sciences, Annual Review of Sociology, 36, pp. 49-67, (2010); Hutchby I., Technologies, texts and affordances, Sociology, 35, 2, pp. 441-456, (2001); Kane G.C., Bijan A., Majchrzak A., Faraj S., The paradoxical influence of social media affordances on intellectual capital creation, The Academy of Management Annual Meeting, (2011); Leonardi P.M., Why do people reject new technologies and stymie organizational changes of which they are in favor?

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, United States","The objective of this paper is to contribute to a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations by examining its multilevel nature. Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level). Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in practice. To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such. The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences.","Configuration;

Insufficient or ineffective training has been identified as one of the key factors underlying this disappointing reality. Among the various enhancements to training being examined in research, the role of intrinsic motivation as a lever to create favorable user perceptions has not been sufficiently exploited. In this research, two studies were conducted to compare a traditional training method with a training method that included a component aimed at enhancing intrinsic motivation. The results strongly favored the use of an intrinsic motivator during training.

A basic premise is that a firm's performance can be explained by how effective the firm is in using information technology (IT) to support and enhance its core competencies. In contrast to past studies that have implicitly assumed that IS assets could have direct effects on firm performance, this study draws from the resource complementarity arguments and posits that it is the targeted use of IS assets that is likely to be rent-yielding. We develop the theoretical underpinnings of this premise and propose a model that interrelates IS resources, IS capabilities, IT support for core competencies, and firm performance. The model is empirically tested using data collected from 129 firms in the United States. The results provide strong support for the research model and suggest that variation in firm performance is explained by the extent to which IT is used to support and enhance a firm's core competencies. The results also support our proposition that an organization's ability to use IT to support its core competencies is dependent on IS functional capabilities, which, in turn, are dependent on the nature of human, technology, and relationship resources of the IS department. These results are interpreted and the implications of this study for IS research and practice are discussed. © 2005 M.E.

Tucker Drive, United States","This paper presents a meta-analysis-based technique to estimate the effect of common method variance on the validity of individual theories. The technique explains between-study variance in observed correlations as a function of the susceptibility to common method variance of the methods employed in individual studies. The technique extends to mono-method studies the concept of method variability underpinning the classic multitrait-multimethod technique. The application of the technique is demonstrated by analyzing the effect of common method variance on the observed correlations between perceived usefulness and usage in the technology acceptance model literature.

Academic literature, popular press, and anecdotal evidence suggest that ICTs are responsible for increased stress levels in individuals (known as technostress). However, despite the influence of stress on health costs and productivity, it is not very clear which characteristics of ICTs create stress. We draw from IS and stress research to build and test a model of technostress. The person-environment fit model is used as a theoretical lens. The research model proposes that certain technology characteristics-like usability (usefulness, complexity, and reliability), intrusiveness (presenteeism, anonymity), and dynamism (pace of change)-are related to stressors (work overload, role ambiguity, invasion of privacy, work-home conflict, and job insecurity). Field data from 661 working professionals was obtained and analyzed. The results clearly suggest the prevalence of technostress and the hypotheses from the model are generally supported. Work overload and role ambiguity are found to be the two most dominant stressors, whereas intrusive technology characteristics are found to be the dominant predictors of stressors. The results open up new avenues for research by highlighting the incidence of technostress in organizations and possible interventions to alleviate it.","ICTs; Information and communication technologies;

This paper gives an overview of heuristic rules that can support practitioners to develop a business process design that is a radical improvement of a current design. The emphasis is on the mechanics of the process, rather than on behavioral or change management aspects. The various best practices are derived from a wide literature survey and supplemented with experiences of the authors. To evaluate the impact of each best practice along the dimensions of cost, flexibility, time and quality, a conceptual framework is presented that synthesizes views from areas such as information systems development, enterprise modeling and workflow management. The best practices are thought to have a wide applicability across various industries and business processes. They can be used as a ""check list"" for process redesign under the umbrella of diverse management approaches such as Total Cycle Time compression, the Lean Enterprise and Constraints Management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Notwithstanding the relevance and potential value of case studies, this methodological approach was once considered to be one of the least systematic. Toward the end of the 1980s, the issue of whether IS case research was rigorously conducted was first raised. Researchers from our field (e.g., Benbasat et al. 1987; Lee 1989) and from other disciplines (e.g., Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1994) called for more rigor in case research and, through their recommendations, contributed to the advancement of the case study methodology. Considering these contributions, the present study seeks to determine the extent to which the field of IS has advanced in its operational use of case study method. Precisely, it investigates the level of methodological rigor in positivist IS case research conducted over the past decade. To fulfill this objective, we identified and coded 183 case articles from seven major IS journals. Evaluation attributes or criteria considered in the present review focus on three main areas, namely, design issues, data collection, and data analysis. While the level of methodological rigor has experienced modest progress with respect to some specific attributes, the overall assessed rigor is somewhat equivocal and there are still significant areas for improvement. One of the keys is to include better documentation particularly regarding issues related to the data collection and analysis processes.","Case study research; Methodological rigor; Positivism; Research design","Management information systems; Process engineering; Research and development management; Societies and institutions; Time series analysis; Case study research; Methodological rigors; Positivism; Research designs; Information technology","","","","","","","Anderson N., Herriot P., Hodgkinson G.P., The practitioner-researcher divide in industrial, work and organizational (IWO) psychology: Where are we now, and where do we go from here?, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 74, 4, pp. 391-411, (2001); Applegate L.M., King J.L., Rigor and releance: Careers on the line, MIS Quarterly, 23, 1, pp. 17-18, (1999); Benbasat I., Goldstein D.K., Mead M., The case research strategy in studies of information systems, MIS Quarterly, 11, 3, pp. 369-385, (1987); Benbasat I., Weber R., Research commentary: Rethinking ""diversity"" in information system research, Information Systems Research, 7, 4, pp. 389-399, (1996); Benbasat I., Zmud R.W., Empirical research in information systems: The practice of relevance, MIS Quarterly, 23, 1, pp. 3-16, (1999); Bonoma T.V., Case research in marketing: Opportunities, problems, and a process, Journal of Marketing Research, 22, pp. 199-208, (1985); Braa K., Vidgen R., Interpretation, intervention, and reduction in the organizational laboratory: A framework for in-context information system research, Accounting, Management and Information Technology, 9, pp. 25-47, (1999); Broadbent M., Weill P., St Clair D., The implications of information technology infrastructure for business process redesign, MIS Quarterly, 23, 2, pp. 159-182, (1999); Brown C., Horizontal mechanisms under differing IS organization context, MIS Quarterly, 23, 3, pp. 421-454, (1999); Campbell D.T., Degrees of freedom' and the case study, Comparative Political Studies, 8, pp. 178-193, (1975); Cavaye A.L.M., Case study research: A multi-faceted research approach for IS, Information Systems Journal, 6, pp. 227-242, (1996); Cavaye A.L.M., The implementation of customer oriented inter-organizational systems: An investigation from the sponsor's perspective, European Journal of Information Systems, 5, 2, pp. 103-119, (1996); Cavaye A.L.M., Christiansen J.K., Understanding IS implementation by estimating power of subunits, European Journal of Information Systems, 5, 4, pp. 222-232, (1996); Clemons E.K., Weber B.W., Restructuring institutional block trading: An overview of the optiMark system, Journal of Management Information Systems, 15, 2, pp. 41-60, (1998); Cox B., Ghoneim S., Drivers and barriers to adopting EDI: A sector analysis of UK industry, European Journal of Information Systems, 5, 1, pp. 24-33, (1996); Crabtree B.F., Miller W.L., Using codes and code manuals,  Ed.), (2000); Creswell J.W., Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing among Five Traditions, (1998); Cross J., Earl M.J., Sampler J.L., Transformation of the IT function at British petroleum, MIS Quarterly, 21, 4, pp. 401-423, (1997); Devers K.J., How will we know 'Good' qualitative research when we see it?

This research note builds upon and extends prior research examining factors that influence key individual beliefs about technology use. It is argued that individuals form beliefs about their use of information technologies within a broad milieu of influences emanating from the individual, institutional, and social contexts in which they interact with IT. We examine the simultaneous effects of these three sets of influences on beliefs about usefulness and ease of use in the context of a contemporary technology targeted at autonomous knowledge workers. Our findings suggest that beliefs about technology use can be influenced by top management commitment to new technology and the individual factors of personal innovativeness and self-efficacy. Surprisingly, social influences from multiple sources exhibited no significant effects. Theoretical and practical implications are offered.","Belief antecedents; Technology adoption; Technology beliefs","Internet; Knowledge acquisition; Management information systems; Professional aspects;

Through a review of 282 works, we inductively build a framework of digital transformation articulated across eight building blocks. Our framework foregrounds digital transformation as a process where digital technologies create disruptions triggering strategic responses from organizations that seek to alter their value creation paths while managing the structural changes and organizational barriers that affect the positive and negative outcomes of this process. Building on this framework, we elaborate a research agenda that proposes [1] examining the role of dynamic capabilities, and [2] accounting for ethical issues as important avenues for future strategic IS research on digital transformation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Digital innovation; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; IS strategy; Literature review; Organizational transformation","Information systems; Digital innovations; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; IS strategy; Literature reviews; Organizational transformation; Management information systems","","","","","","","Abell P., Felin T., Foss N., Building microfoundations for the routines, capabilities, and performance links, Manag.

In this paper, we discuss many of the important IS success research contributions of the last decade, focusing especially on research efforts that apply, validate, challenge, and propose enhancements to our original model. Based on our evaluation of those contributions, we propose minor refinements to the model and propose an updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model. We discuss the utility of the updated model for measuring e-commerce system success. Finally, we make a series of recommendations regarding current and future measurement of IS success.","Evaluation of information systems; Impact of information technology; Information quality; Information systems success;

Increasing business dynamics, changing customer preferences, and disruptive technological shifts pose the need for two kinds of flexibility that interenterprise information systems must address - the ability of interenterprise linkages to support changes in offering characteristics (offering flexibility) and the ability to alter linkages to partner with different supply chain players (partnering flexibility). This study explores how enterprises in supply chains may forge supply chain linkages that enable both types of flexibility jointly, and allow them to deal with ubiquitous change. Drawing on March and Simon's coordination theory, we propose two design principles: (1) advance structuring of interorganizational processes and information exchange that allows partnering organizations to be loosely coupled, and (2) IT-supported dynamic adjustment that allows enterprises to quickly sense change and adapt their supply chain linkages. This study reports on a survey of 41 supply chain relationships in the IT industry. For design principle, our empirical investigation of factors shows (1) that modular design of interconnected processes and structured data connectivity are associated with higher supply chain flexibility, and (2) that deep coordination-related knowledge is critical for supply chain flexibility. Also, sharing a broad range of information with partners is detrimental to supply chain flexibility, and organizations should instead focus on improving the quality of information shared. Fo r industry managers, the study provides clear insights for information infrastructure design. To manage their interdependencies, enterprises need to encapsulate their interconnected processes in modular chunks, and support these with IT platforms for information exchange in structured formats. Enterprises also need to nurture their execution capabilities by putting in place the information systems to process information exchanged with partners, augmenting their understanding of factors such as how partner actions need to trigger adaptive responses. For researchers, the study initiates a new stream of theorizing that focuses on the role of the information infrastructure in managing the tension between competing goals of offering flexibility and partnering flexibility. © 2005 M.E.

Although the satisfaction and usage constructs have been well studied in the information systems literature, there has been only limited attention to information and system quality over the past decade. To address this shortcoming, we developed a model consisting of nine fundamental determinants of quality in an information technology context, four under the rubric of information quality (the output of an information system) and five that describe system quality (the information processing system required to produce the output). We then empirically examined the aptness of our model using a sample of 465 data warehouse users from seven different organizations that employed report-based, query-based, and analytical business intelligence tools. The results suggest that our determinants are indeed predictive of overall information and system quality in data warehouse environments, and that our model strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and parsimony. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for both theory and the development and implementation of information technology applications in practice. © 2005 M.E.

A review of the MIS and broader management literatures suggests researchers investigating moderated relationships often commit one or more errors falling into three broad categories: inappropriate use or interpretation of statistics, misalignment of research design with phenomena of interest, and measurement or scaling issues. Examples of nine common errors are presented. Commission of these errors is expected to yield literatures characterized by mixed results at best, and thoroughly erroneous results at worse. Procedures representing examples of best practice and reporting guidelines are provided to help MIS investigators avoid or minimize these errors.","Contingency models; PLS; Tests of moderation","Error correction;

Often cited as a significant challenge in knowledge management practices is the issue of organizational culture. Although many studies raise the issue of organizational culture's influence on knowledge management success few investigate the way in which this influence manifests itself. This paper aims to explore how organizational culture influences knowledge management practices. Using a case study method, we examine the cultural values and knowledge management approaches within a large global information services company and one of its knowledge communities. The findings highlight the influence of culture on the use of knowledge management technologies and the outcomes of such use. © 2006 M.E.

In the years that have passed since that time, the profession has undergone many changes. Novel technologies and management trends have come and gone. New professional societies have been formed and grown in prominence and new demands have been placed on the field's research and teaching obligations. But the issue of rigor in IS research has persisted throughout all such changes. Without solid validation of the instruments that are used to gather data upon which findings and interpretations are based, the very scientific basis of positivist, quantitative research is threatened. As a retrospective on the Straub article, this research seeks to determine if and how the field has advanced in instrument validation. As evidence of the change, we coded positivist, quantitative research articles in five major journals over a recent three year period for use of validation techniques. Findings suggest that the field has advanced in many areas, but, overall, it appears that a majority of published studies are still not sufficiently validating their instruments. Based on these findings, approaches are suggested for reinvigorating the quest for validation in IS research via content/construct validity, reliability, and manipulation validity.","","Evaluation; Heuristic methods; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Reliability; Research; Statistical methods; Construct validity; Content validity; Guidelines; IS research methods; Manipulation validity; Positivist research; Psychometrics; Quantitative research; Validation; Management information systems","","","","","","","Alavi M., Carlson P., A review of MIS research and disciplinary development, Journal of Management Information Systems, 8, 4, pp. 45-62, (1992); Alavi M., Carlson P., Brooke G., The ecology of MIS research: A twenty year status review, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 363-1271, (1989); Alreck P.A., Settle R.B.,  Ed.), (1995)","M.-C.

This paper proposes user involvement as an intervening variable between user participation and system use. Embedding the constructs of participation and involvement into the theoretical framework of Fishbein and Ajzen, a model is developed and tested in a field study of information system projects. Several key findings emerge from the study. User participation and user involvement represent two distinct constructs, with participation leading to involvement, and involvement mediating the relationship between participation and system use. The critical dimension of user participation is overall responsibility. The role of user participation and involvement is different, depending upon whether system use is mandatory or voluntary.","","Information management; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Information services; Information use; Management science; Project management; Implementation; Information system; Responsibility; User involvement; User participation; Management information systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050649674"

Information processing needs are assessed based on various characteristics of the product and procurement environment and information processing capabilities are assessed by the level of information technology support for various activities in the procurement life cycle. A taxonomy of information processing needs and information processing capabilities is developed. The effect of the fit between information processing needs and capabilities on procurement performance is examined. The study collected data on 142 products through personal interviews and surveys, used cluster analytic techniques to develop taxonomies, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the fit between needs and capability, modeled as an interaction effect. The results reveal two clusters for information processing needs and three clusters for information processing capability. ANOVA results show that the interactive effect of information needs and capability has a significant effect on performance, supporting our fit theory. © 2005 M.E.

Control is defined as all attempts to motivate individuals to achieve desired objectives, and it can be exercised via formal and informal modes. Much of the previous research investigating the choice of control mode has focused on direct reporting relationships between IS project leaders and their superiors in a hierarchical setting. However, the client-IS relationships may take on a variety of forms, including both hierarchical and lateral settings. Moreover, prior research has found that the knowledge of the systems development process is a key antecedent of control, yet clients are unlikely to be as knowledgeable as IS professionals about this process. It is therefore unclear whether prior findings will generalize to the client-IS pair, and the goal of this research is to examine the exercise of control across this relationship. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey of 69 pairs of clients and IS project leaders. The results are largely consistent with prior research on the antecedents of formal control modes, but they shed new insight on the choice of informal control modes.","Control; IS Project Management; IS-Client Relationships","Knowledge based systems; Management information systems; Managers; Systems development; Project management","","","","","","","Alavi M., Phillips J.S., Freedman S.M., Strategies for control of end-user computing: Impact on end users, Proc.

However, factors affecting alignment have received relatively little empirical attention. Moreover, IS strategic alignment is assumed to facilitate the performance of all organizations, regardless of type or business strategy. By using two studies of business firms and academic institutions, this paper: 1) develops and tests a model relating alignment, its antecedents, and its consequences and 2) examines differences in these relationships across organizational types and strategies. Findings indicate that alignment depends on shared domain knowledge and prior IS success, and also support the expected positive impact of alignment on organizational performance. Differences across Prospector, Analyzer, and Defender business strategies are examined. A key research contribution is the empirical demonstration that the importance of alignment, as well as the mechanisms used to attain alignment, vary by business strategy and industry. In past alignment studies, controlling for industry has not been uncommon. The findings suggest that future research studies should also control for business strategy. The article also empirically demonstrates that past implementation success influences alignment. In addition, it highlights the influence of a process variable, strategic planning, on the development of shared knowledge and, consequently, on alignment. This paper examines strategic issues related to the management of technology. Data from multiple surveys are used to test the extent to which strategic planning, shared business-IS knowledge, prior IS success, and other variables consistently enhance IS alignment. The study also provides empirical support for the popular argument that IS alignment improves organizational performance. It extends the current literature by examining the extent to which these findings hold across firm strategies and industries. The authors argue that not all firms are equally well served by allocating scarce resources to improve IS alignment. © 2006 IEEE.","Academic institutions; Antecedents of alignment; Business strategy; Information systems strategy; Organizational characteristics; Organizational performance; Strategic alignment","Estimation; Information science; Mathematical models; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Academic institutions; Antecedents of alignment; Business strategy; Information system strategy; Organizational characteristics; Organizational performance; Strategic alignment; Management information systems","","","","","","","Armstrong C.P., Sambamurthy V., Information technology assimilation in firms: The influence of senior leadership on IT infrastructures, Inf.

While recently the idea of competitive differentiation through IT has been challenged, this study contrasts the traditional thinking about competitive advantage with the resource-based view. Specifically, it is argued that by demarcating specific types of capabilities, we can contribute to better understanding of the sources of IT-based competitive advantage. Conceptually, we distinguish here between value, competitive, and dynamic capabilities as three distinct types of capabilities. Within each type, we identify specific capabilities, such as quality of the IT infrastructure, IT business experience, relationship infrastructure, and intensity of organizational learning, and present a model that describes relationships between these capabilities and competitive advantage. We then empirically test the model using data collected via a national mail survey from chief IT executives from 202 manufacturing firms. While the quality of the IT infrastructure is hypothesized as a value capability and expectedly did not have any significant effect on competitive advantage, the quality of IT business expertise and the relationship infrastructure (competitive capabilities) did. The results of the study also indicate that the intensity of organizational learning (dynamic capability) was significantly related to all of the capabilities. These results point to the importance of delineating capabilities such as relationship infrastructure that can facilitate differentiation in the marketplace, and dynamic capabilities such as organizational learning as an important antecedent to IT capability building. © 2005 M.E.

We develop the idea that team creativity results primarily from integration of individually held expertise of team members at the team level. We further propose the quality of intrateam relationships and knowledge complementarities that align the work of individual team members at the project level influence creativity primarily through the process of expertise integration. We use data from a field study of 142 participants in 42 ISD projects to test the proposed model. The paper makes three new contributions to the IS literature. Its key contribution lies in developing an expertise integration view of team creativity. We demonstrate the centrality of integrating individually held tacit and explicit knowledge about the problem domain and the technology at the team level in achieving team creativity. The use of a process-focused conceptualization of team creativity is especially noteworthy here. The second contribution of the paper lies in conceptually developing and operationalizing the concept of expertise integration, a mechanism by which individually held knowledge is integratively applied at the project level. Although the importance of knowledge in the ISD process is widely recognized in prior research, this is the first study to develop the concept in a operationally meaningful way. The third key contribution lies in showing that the compositional and relational attributes of ISD project teams - diverse specialized knowledge in a team, the quality of intrateam working relationships, and members' cross-domain absorptive capacity - do not engender creativity by themselves; they do so primarily because they enhance integration of individual at the project level. We offer empirical evidence for such full mediation. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, which are discussed in the paper. © 2005 M.E.

Yet, in spite of this valuable work, it is still unclear through what mechanisms IT governance affects organizational performance. We make a detailed argument for the mediation of strategic alignment in this process. Strategic alignment remains a top priority for business and IT executives, but theory-based empirical research on the relative importance of the factors affecting strategic alignment is still lagging. By consolidating strategic alignment and IT governance models, this research proposes a nomological model showing how organizational value is created through IT governance mechanisms. Our research model draws upon the resource-based view of the firm and provides guidance on how strategic alignment can mediate the effectiveness of IT governance on organizational performance. As such, it contributes to the knowledge bases of both alignment and IT governance literatures. Using dyadic data collected from 131 Taiwanese companies (cross-validated with archival data from 72 firms), we uncover a positive, significant, and impactful linkage between IT governance mechanisms and strategic alignment and, further, between strategic alignment and organizational performance. We also show that the effect of IT governance mechanisms on organizational performance is fully mediated by strategic alignment. Besides making contributions to construct and measure items in this domain, this research contributes to the theory base by integrating and extending the literature on IT governance and strategic alignment, both of which have long been recognized as critical for achieving organizational goals. © 2015 The Authors.","Degree-symmetric measures; IT governance mechanisms; Organizational performance; Strategic alignment","Contingency factors; Degree-symmetric measures; Information technology governance; IT governance; Organizational goals; Organizational performance; Resource-based view of the firm; Strategic alignment; Management information systems","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Lucas H.C., The information systems identity crisis: Focusing on high-visibility and high-impact research, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 381-398, (2005); Ali S., Green P., Effective information technology (it) governance mechanisms: An it outsourcing perspective, Information Systems Frontiers, 142, pp. 179-193, (2012); Aral S., Weill P., It assets, organizational capabilities, and firm performance: How resource allocations and organizational differences explain performance variation, Organization Science, 18, 5, pp. 763-780, (2007); Armstrong J., Overton T., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Armstrong C.P., Sambamurthy V., Information technology assimilation in firms: The inxuence of senior leadership and it infrastructures, Information Systems Research, 10, 4, pp. 304-328, (1999); Bagozzi R.P., Fornell C., Theoretical concepts, measurement, and meaning, A Second Generation of Multivariate Analysis, 2, pp. 5-23, (1982); Bailey K.D., Methods of Social Science Research, (1978); Leading alignment, CIO Insight, 1, 45, pp. 19-20, (2004); Banker R.D., Chang H., Janakiraman S.N., Konstans C., A balanced scorecard analysis of performance metrics, European Journal of Operational Research, 154, 2, pp. 423-436, (2004); Banker R.D., Hu N., Pavlou P.A., Luftman J., Cio reporting structure, strategic positioning, and firm performance, MIS Quarterly, 35, 2, pp. 487-504, (2011); Banker R.D., Janakiraman S., Konstans C., Balanced scorecard: Linking strategy to performance, Financial Executives Research Foundation, (2001); Barclay D., Higgins C., Thomson R., The partial least squares approach to causal modeling, personal computer adoption and use as an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Barney J.B., Firm resources and susta ined competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Bergeron F., Raymond L., Rivard S., Fit in strategic information technology management research: An empirical comparison of perspectives, The International Journal of Management Science, 29, 2, pp. 125-142, (2001); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capabilities and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bowen P.L., Cheung M.-Y.D., Rohde F.H., Enhancing it governance practices: A model and case study of an organization's efforts, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 8, 3, pp. 191-221, (2007); Bradley R.V., Byrd T.A., Pridmore J.L., Thrasher E., Pratt R.M., Mbarika V.W., An empirical examination of antecedents and consequences of it governance in u.s.

A field survey gathered data from 185 top information systems executives regarding information technology applications which had been developed to gain competitive advantage. A confirmatory analysis revealed that CAPITA may be conceptualized in terms of nine dimensions which satisfy key measurement criteria including unidimensionality and convergent validity, discriminant validity, predictive validity, and reliability. The nine dimensions form the basis of a preliminary multidimensional measure or index of competitive advantage which has practical uses for competitive assessment. These include justifying and evaluating applications and acting as dependent variables in empirical competitive advantage research. Extensions entail formulating alternative measures of CAPITA to clarify the theoretical foundations of the construct, validating the latent-structure model on another data set, use of multiple informants for data collection, and exploring complex factor structures for the construct.","","Competition; Data acquisition; Management information systems; Management science; Mathematical models; Measurements; Competitive advantage; Measurement scales; Multidimensional modeling; Information technology","","","","","","","","","","Inst of Management Sciences","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028752003"

This paper develops a conceptual framework that relates information-integration initiatives to manufacturer profitability. The framework allows such initiatives to impact inventory management and revenue-enhancing measures that, in turn, increase manufacturer profit margins, or affect profit margins directly. Through an extensive survey in the food and consumer packaged goods industry, we empirically examine this framework. The analysis reveals that the various integration techniques are differentially associated with manufacturer performance. Collaborative planning on replenishment, in the form of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is directly and positively related to manufacturer margins, while collaboration on new products and services is positively related to intermediate performance measures. Specifically, this latter form of collaboration allows the manufacturer to charge higher wholesale prices and, interestingly, is associated with lower retailer, and consequently manufacturer, stockouts. In contrast, collaboration on the handling of excess and defective retailer inventory (i.e., reverse logistics) results in higher manufacturer stock-out levels, on average. Solely sharing information on either inventory levels or customer needs is associated with higher manufacturer performance measures up to a certain point; sharing this information is prevalent among manufacturers that achieve industry-average profitability relative to those that achieve below industry-average profitability. The paper explains these results in the context of the conceptual framework developed and discusses the managerial implications for effective coordination between supply chain partners.","Collaboration; Information integration; Supply chain management","Costs; Inventory control; Operations research; Packaging materials; Problem solving; Production engineering; Regression analysis; Sales; Scheduling; Societies and institutions; Synchronization; Warehouses; Collaboration; Information integration; Information sharing; Supply chain management; Management information systems","","","","","","","Burke M.C., Strategic choice and marketing managers: An examination of business-level marketing objectives, J.

In this commentary, we begin by discussing why establishing an identity for the IS field Is important. We then describe what such an identity may look like by proposing a core set of properties, i.e., concepts and phenomena, that define the IS field. Next, we discuss research by IS scholars that either fails to address this core set of properties (labeled as error of exclusion) or that addresses concepts/phenomena falling outside this core set (labeled as error of inclusion). We conclude by offering suggestions for redirecting IS scholarship toward the concepts and phenomena that we argue define the core of the IS discipline.","Errors of exclusion; Errors of inclusion; Is discipline; IT artifact; IT nomological net","Error analysis; Information technology; Information use; Investments; Research and development management; Societies and institutions; Errors of exclusion; Errors of inclusion; Information systems (IS); Management information systems","","","","","","","Albert S., Whetten D.A., Organizational identity, Research in Organizational Behavior, 7, pp. 263-295, (1985); Aldrich H., Organizations Evolving, (1999); Benbasat I., Weber R., Rethinking diversity in information systems research, Information Systems Research, 7, 4, pp. 389-399, (1996); Jiang Z., Benbasat I., Virtual product experience: Effects of visual and functional control on perceived diagnosticity in electronic shopping, Working Paper, (2002); Kempf D.S., Smith R.E., Consumer processing of product trial and the influence of prior advertising: A structural modeling approach, Journal of Marketing Research, 35, 3, pp. 325-337, (1998); Massey A., Wheeler B.C., Keen P., Technology matters, Information Technology and the Future Enterprise: New Models for Managers, pp. 25-48, (2001); Orlikowski W., Lacono S., Desperately seeking the 'IT in IT research - A call to theorizing the IT artifact, Information Systems Research, 12, 2, pp. 121-134, (2001); Robey D., Diversity in information systems research: Threat, promise, and responsibility, Information Systems Research, 7, 4, pp. 400-408, (1996); Todd P., Benbasat I., Evaluating the impact of DSS, cognitive effort, and incentives on strategy selection, Information Systems Research, 10, 4, pp. 356-374, (1999)","I.

Such work can help develop rich insights into various phenomena of interest that cannot be fully understood using only a quantitative or a qualitative method. Notwithstanding the benefits and repeated calls for such work, there is a dearth of mixed methods research in information systems. Building on the literature on recent methodological advances in mixed methods research, we develop a set of guidelines for conducting mixed methods research in IS. We particularly elaborate on three important aspects of conducting mixed methods research: (1) appropriateness of a mixed methods approach; (2) development of meta-inferences (i.e., substantive theory) from mixed methods research; and (3) assessment of the quality of meta-inferences (i.e., validation of mixed methods research). The applicability of these guidelines is illustrated using two published IS papers that used mixed methods.

Perdue School of Business, Information and Decision Sciences, Salisbury State University, Salisbury, Maryland, 21801, United States","A constant concern of management information systems (MIS) researchers and practitioners has been improving user satisfaction with the information services function (USISF). Due to the growth of end‐user computing, decentralization, and alternative sources of supply, an organization's information services function (ISF) is now faced with serving customers that possess substantial discretion in their use and purchase of information systems (IS) services. This increasingly market‐oriented environment demands sensitivity to IS customers' expectations and perceived value of ISF services. One important source of guidance in such an IS management environment is to look at marketing literature for frameworks that may permit the ISF to more effectively determine and convey the value of their services. Recognizing the need to improve existing MIS measures of user satisfaction with the ISF, this study adapts the SERVQUAL measure from marketing to provide more specific information about user satisfaction with the information service function. It was found that, while the three original dimensions of the traditional user information satisfaction (UIS) measure remain strong predictors of overall ISF user satisfaction, two aspects of IS service quality, “reliability” and “empathy,” are also significant predictors. The results suggest that the original dimensions of UIS may not be comprehensive enough to capture the more detailed dimensions of ISF service quality in SERVQUAL, and that the reliability and empathy dimensions of service quality may be needed to supplement the traditional UIS measure in determining user satisfaction with the information services function. Implications for research and practice resulting from these findings are discussed. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Although the business value of ERP implementations has been extensively debated in trade periodicals in the form of qualitative discussion or detailed case studies, there is little large-sample statistical evidence on whether the benefits of ERP implementation exceed the costs and risks. With multiyear multi-firm ERP implementation and financial data, we find that firms that invest in ERP tend to show higher performance across a wide variety of financial metrics. Even though there is a slowdown in business performance and productivity shortly after the implementation, financial markets consistently reward the adopters with higher market valuation (as measured by Tobin's q). Due to the lack of mid- and long-term post-implementation data, future research on the long-run impact of ERP is proposed.","Enterprise Resource Planning systems; Information technology; Productivity; Productivity analysis; ROI","Computer software; Costs; Information technology; Investments; Management information systems; Productivity; Risk assessment; Financial metrics; Enterprise resource planning","","","","","National Science Foundation, (IIS-9733877)","Acknowledgments:The authors are grateful to Paul R.

While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.","Case study; Critical perspective; Ethnography; Field study; Hermeneutics; Interpretivist perspective; IS research methodologies","Management information systems; Mathematical models; Natural sciences; Project management; Research and development management; Risk assessment; Social aspects; Students; Case studies; Critical perspective; Ethnography; Field study; Hermeneutics; Interpretivist perspective; IS research methodologies; Information technology","","","","","","","Adorno T.W., Frenkel-Brunswick E., Levinson D.J., Nevitt Sanford R., The Authoritarian Personality, (1950); Alvesson M., Willmott H., Critical Management Studies, (1992); Alvesson M., Willmott H., On the idea of emancipation in management and organization studies, Academy of Management Review, 17, 3, pp. 432-464, (1992); Yin R.K., Case Study Research, Design and Methods, 2nd Ed., (1994); Zuboff S., In the Age of the Smart Machine, (1988)","H.K.

In the interconnected electronic business environment of today, security concerns are paramount. Management must invest in IS security to prevent abuses that can lead to competitive disadvantage. Using the literature on security practices and organizational factors, this study develops an integrative model of IS security effectiveness and empirically tests the model. The data were collected through a survey of IS managers from various sectors of the economy. Small and medium-sized enterprises were found to engage in fewer deterrent efforts compared to larger organizations. Organizations with stronger top management support were found to engage in more preventive efforts than organizations with weaker support from higher management. Financial organizations were found to undertake more deterrent efforts and have stiffer deterrent severity than organizations in other sectors. Moreover, greater deterrent efforts and preventive measures were found to lead to enhanced IS security effectiveness. Implications of these findings for further research and practice are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper reports on the development and measurement validity of a diagnostic tool used in recently published research to evaluate an organization's overall information systems and services. A distinctive feature of this instrument is that it is conceptually based on the task-technology fit theory in which the correspondence between information systems functionality and task requirements leads to positive user evaluations, and positive performance impacts. Specifically, the instrument development was guided by a task model of managerial decision making using recorded organizational information. This model suggested the different information systems functionalities required by users for that task, which then serve as the basis for a ""task-technology fit"" (TTF) instrument. The instrument thus measures the degree to which an organization's information systems and services meet the information needs of its managers. An extensive test of the measurement validity of the instrument is conducted using a sample of 357 users in 10 companies. It is found to have excellent reliability and discriminant validity for 12 dimensions of TTF, and also exhibits strong predictive validity. Finally, the instrument is compared to two other well-known user evaluation instruments. Though no single instrument can meet all needs, the instrument presented here should be considered an attractive option for researchers and practitioners seeking to measure the effectiveness of organizational information systems.","Management Information Systems; Survey Research/Design; User Evaluations of IS Success","","","","","","","","Arrow K.J., The Limits of Organization, (1974); Bagozzi R.P., The role of measurement in theory construction and hypothesis testing: Toward a holistic model, Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, (1979); Bagozzi R.P., Causal Models in Marketing, (1980); Bagozzi R.P., Phillips L.W., Representing and testing organizational theories: A holistic construal, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 459-489, (1982); Bailey J.E., Pearson S.W., Development of a tool measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, Management Science, 29, 5, pp. 530-544, (1983); Baroudi J.J., Orlikowski W.J., A short-form measure of user information satisfaction, Journal of Management Information Systems, 4, 4, pp. 44-59, (1988); Bentler P.M., Bonett D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, 3, pp. 588-606, (1980); Breckler S.J., Empirical validation of affect, behavior, and cognition as distinct components of attitude, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, 6, pp. 1191-1205, (1984); Budd R.J., Response bias and the theory of reasoned action, Social Cognition, 5, 2, pp. 95-107, (1987); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 56, 2, pp. 81-105, (1959); Carmines E.G., Zeller R.A., Reliability and Validity Assessment, (1979); Connolly T., Thorn B.K., Predecisional information acquisition: Effects on suboptimal search strategies, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 39, 3, pp. 397-416, (1987); Converse J.M., Presser S., Survey Questions: Handcrafting the Standardized Questionnaire, (1986); Cook T.D., Campbell D.T., Quasi-experimentation: Design and Analysis Issues for Field Settings, (1979); Cowan D.A., Developing a process model of problem recognition, Academy of Management Review, 11, 4, pp. 763-776, (1986); Culnan M.J., The dimensions of accessibility to online information: Implications for implementing office information systems, ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems, 2, 2, pp. 141-150, (1984); Culnan M.J., The dimensions of perceived accessibility to information: Implications for delivery of information systems and services, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 36, 5, pp. 302-308, (1985); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Davis G.B., Olson M.H., Management Information Systems: Conceptual Foundations, Structure, and Development, (1985); Doll W.J., Torkzadeh G., The measurement of end-user computing satisfaction, MIS Quarterly, 12, 2, pp. 259-276, (1988); Epstein B.J., King W.R., An experimental study of the value of information, Omega, 10, 3, pp. 249-258, (1982); Ference T.P., Organizational communications systems and the decision process, Management Science, 17, 2, (1970); Gallagher C.A., Perceptions of the value of a management information system, Academy of Management Journal, 17, 1, pp. 46-55, (1974); Galletta D.F., Lederer A.L., Some cautions on the measurement of user information satisfaction, Decision Sciences, 20, 3, pp. 419-438, (1989); Goodhue D.L., IS attitudes: Toward theoretical and definitional clarity, Data Base, 19, 3-4, pp. 6-15, (1988); Goodhue D.L., User evaluations of mis success: What are we really measuring?, Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences, 4, pp. 303-314, (1992); Goodhue D.L., Understanding user evaluations of information systems, Management Science, 41, 12, pp. 1827-1844, (1995); Goodhue D.L., Thompson R.L., Task-technology fit and individual performance, MIS Quarterly, 19, 2, pp. 213-236, (1995); Hayduk L.A., Structural Equation Modeling with LISREL, (1987); Joreskog K.G., Sorbom D., LISREL V, Analysis of Linear Structural Relationships by Maximum Likelihood and Least Squares Methods, (1981); McGuire W.J., Attitudes and attitude change, Handbook of Social Psychology, (1985); Melone N.P., A theoretical assessment of the user-satisfaction construct in information system research, Management Science, 36, 1, pp. 76-91, (1990); Novick M.R., Lewis C., Coefficient alpha and the reliability of composite measurements, Psychometrika, 32, 1, pp. 1-13, (1967); Nunnally J.C., Durham R.L., Validity, reliability, and special problems of measurement in evaluation research, Handbook of Evaluation Research, (1975); O'Reilly C.A.

Measures are developed and validated for managerial control and team-member control from both an outcome and a process perspective. Results from a study of 41 actual I/S design teams indicate that high-performancing teams exhibit high process control by managers and high outcome control by team members. The results also support the proposition that both managerial and team-member control coexists and that increases in the total level of control behavior is positively correlated with performance.","","Behavioral research; Control theory; Management information systems; Management science; Performance; Construct validation; Design teams; Managerial control; Project managers; Software development; Team performance; Project management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026872084"

Unlike the typical focus on adoption as found in the literature, we focus on postadoption stages, that is, actual usage and value creation. The model thus moves beyond dichotomous ""adoption versus nonadoption"" and accounts for the ""missing link"" - actual usage - as a critical stage of value creation. The model links technological, organizational, and environmental factors to e-business use and value, based on which a series of hypotheses are developed. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a dataset of 624 firms across 10 countries in the retail industry. To probe deeper into whether e-business use and value are influenced by economic environments, two subsamples from developed and developing countries are compared. The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity. Our study also adds an international dimension to the innovation diffusion literature, showing that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect technology diffusion across different countries. © 2005 INFORMS.","Back-end integration; E-business; Firm performance; Innovation; International perspective; IT investment; Resource-based view; Technology diffusion; Usage; Value","Backpropagation; Information technology; Internet; Investments; Management information systems; Retail stores; Societies and institutions; Back-end propagation; E-business; Firm performance; International perspective; IT investment; Resource based view; Technology diffusion; Usage; Value; Electronic commerce","","","","","","","Amit R., Zott C., Value creation in e-business, Strategic Management J., 22, 6-7, pp. 493-520, (2001); Austin J.E., Managing in Developing Countries, (1990); Bakos Y., The emerging role of electronic marketplaces on the Internet, Comm.

Quality, customer satisfaction, innovation, market share--metrics like these often reflect a company's economic condition and growth prospects better than its reported earnings do. Depending on an accounting department to reveal a company's future will leave it hopelessly mired in the past. More and more managers are changing their company's performance measurement systems to track nonfinancial measures and reinforce new competitive strategies. Five activities are essential: developing an information architecture; putting the technology in place to support this architecture; aligning bonuses and other incentives with the new system; drawing on outside resources; and designing an internal process to ensure the other four activities occur. New technologies and more sophisticated databases have made the change to nonfinancial performance measurement systems possible and economically feasible. Industry and trade associations, consulting firms, and public accounting firms that already have well-developed methods for assessing market share and other performance metrics can add to the revolution's momentum--as well as profit from the business opportunities it presents. Every company will have its own key measures and distinctive process for implementing the change. But making it happen will always require careful preparation, perseverance, and the conviction of the CEO that it must be carried through. When one leading company can demonstrate the long-term advantage of its superior performance on quality or innovation or any other nonfinancial measure, it will change the rules for all its rivals forever.","","Economic Competition; Financial Management; Industry; Management Information Systems; Organizational Innovation; Planning Techniques; Program Evaluation; United States; article; economic aspect; financial management; health care quality; industry; information system; methodology; organization; organization and management; standard; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00178012","","","10109469","English","Harv Bus Rev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025930128"

Like most previous methods, the development and promotion of these methods have been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little participation from the research community during the early stages of evolution. While these methods are now the focus of more and more research efforts, most studies are still based on XP, Scrum, and other industry-driven foundations, with little or no conceptual studies of ISD agility in existence. As a result, this study proposes that there are a number of significant conceptual shortcomings with agile methods and the associated literature in its current state, including a lack of clarity, theoretical glue, parsimony, limited applicability, and naivety regarding the evolution of the concept of agility in fields outside systems development. Furthermore, this has significant implications for practitioners, rendering agile method comparison and many other activities very difficult, especially in instances such as distributed development and large teams that are not conducive to many of the commercial agile methods. This study develops a definition and formative taxonomy of agility in an ISD context, based on a structured literature review of agility across a number of disciplines, including manufacturing and management where the concept originated, matured, and has been applied and tested thoroughly over time. The application of the texonomy in practice is then demonstrated through a series of thought trials conducted in a large multinational organization. The intention is that the definition and taxonomy can then be used as a starting point to study ISD method agility regardless of whether the method is XP or Scrum, agile or traditional, complete or fragmented, out-of-the-box or in-house, used as is or tailored to suit the project context. © 2009 INFORMS.","Agile; Agile management; Agile manufacturing; Conceptual research; Systems development","Industrial research; Information systems; Management information systems; Manufacture; Research and development management; Taxonomies; Agile; Agile manufacturing; Conceptual research; Distributed development; Information systems development; Multinational organizations; Research communities; Systems development; Agile manufacturing systems","","","","","","","Abrahamsson P., Salo O., Ronkainen J., Warsta J., Agile software development methods: Review and analysis, (2002); Agarwal A., Shankar R., Tiwari M., Modeling the metrics of lean, agile and leagile supply chains: An ANP-based approach, Eur.

To address this gap, we conduct a longitudinal analysis of a B2B company's journey to enact its B2C digital strategy, using the dynamic capabilities approach. We found that as an organization shifts towards a digital strategy, misalignments between the emergent strategy and resources give rise to tension. Our study resulted in the development of an aligning process model that is comprised of three phases (exploratory, building, and extending) and generalizable organizational aligning actions that form the organization's sensing, seizing, and transforming capacities. These aligning actions iteratively reconfigured organizational resources and refined strategy in order to respond to both changes in the environment and internal tensions. We also recognized that there are challenges to alignment, and conceptualized them as paradoxical tensions. This provided insights as to how such tensions are triggered and how they can be addressed. Finally, by applying the dynamic capabilities approach to aligning, we also show that alignment is not separate from such capabilities, but that aligning is enacted through the sensing, seizing and transforming capacities and their attendant aligning actions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aligning; B2C ecommerce; Digital strategy; Dynamic capabilities; IT Alignment; Tension","Information systems; Management information systems; Aligning; B2C e-commerce; Digital strategies; Dynamic capabilities; IT alignment; Tension; Enterprise resource management","","","","","","","Barreto I., Dynamic capabilities: a review of past research and an agenda for the future, J.

Yet with a recent rise in environmental volatility, firms are asking how to be more agile in identifying and responding to market-based threats and opportunities. Whether alignment helps or hurts agility is an unresolved issue. This paper presents a variety of arguments from the literature that alternately predict a positive or negative relationship between alignment and agility. This relationship is then tested using a model in which agility mediates the link between alignment and firm performance under varying conditions of IT infrastructure flexibility and environmental volatility. Using data from a matched survey of IT and business executives in 241 firms, we uncover a positive and significant link between alignment and agility and between agility and firm performance. We also show that the effect of alignment on performance is fully mediated by agility, that environmental volatility positively moderates the link between agility and firm performance, and that agility has a greater impact on firm performance in more volatile markets. While IT infrastructure flexibility does not moderate the link between alignment and agility, except in a volatile environment, we reveal that IT infrastructure flexibility has a positive and significant main effect on agility. In fact, the effect of IT infrastructure flexibility on agility is as strong as the effect of alignment on agility. This research extends and integrates the literature on strategic IT alignment and organizational agility at a time when both alignment and agility are recognized as critical and concurrent organizational goals.","Agility;

Information technology plays an important role by eitherenabling or constraining successful BPR. This paper explores the links between firm-wide IT infrastructure and business process change. IT infrastructure is the base foundation of the IT portfolio, which is shared throughout the firm in the form of reliable services, and is usually coordinated by the IS group. IT infrastructure capability includes both the technical and managerial expertise required to provide reliable physical services and extensive electronic connectivity within and outside the firm. Exploratory case analysis of four firms (two in retail and two in petroleum) was used to understand the ways IT infrastructure contributes to success in implementing BPR. The finding was that all firms needed a basic level of IT infrastructure capability to implement BPR. The firms that had developed a higher level of IT infrastructure capabilities, before or concurrent with undertaking business process redesign, were able to implement extensive changes to their business processes over relatively short time frames. The higher level of infrastructure capability was provided in the form of(1) a sef of infrastructure services that spanned organizational boundaries such as those between functions, business units, or firms, and (2) the ability of the infrastructure to reach particular constituencies inside and outside the firm to transfer information and process complex transactions. The more extensive business process changes were more innovative and radical, crossing business and functional unit boundaries, and resulted in more significant business impact. The practical implication of the study is that before embarking on any form of BPR, managers should complete a business audit of their IT infrastructure capabilities, as these capabilities have an important impact on the speed and nature of business process change.","Business process redesign and reengineering; Business strategy; Exploratory case analysis; IT alignment; IT infrastructure; IT services","Database systems; Management information systems; Management science; Reengineering; Supervisory personnel; Telecommunication networks; Business process redesign and reengineering; Business strategy; Case analysis; Information Technology (IT) alignment; Information Technology (IT) infrastructure; Information Technology (IT) services; Information technology","","","","","","","Bashein B., Markus L., Riley P., Preconditions for BPR success: And how to prevent failures, Information Systems Management, 11, 2, pp. 7-13, (1994); Benjamin R.I., Managing information technology enabled change, Human Organizational and Social Dimensions of Information Systems Development, pp. 381-398, (1993); Porter M.E., Millar V., How information gives you competitive edge, Harvard Business Review, 63, 4, pp. 149-160, (1985); Ramcharamdas E., Xerox creates a continuous learning environment for business transformation, Planning Review, 22, 2, pp. 34-38, (1994); Snell M., Dissatisfied companies blast reengineering, The Australian; Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, 2nd Ed., (1994)","M.

This paper has two specific goals in its effort to fill this gap in the literature. The first, so that these outcomes can be systematically investigated, is to develop a taxonomy of information privacy-protective responses (IPPR). This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses - refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations - that are classified into three categories: information provision, private action, and public action. Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antecedents - concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining - of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR. The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users. The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR. These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR. Such an understanding could enable researchers to analyze a variety of behavioralresponses to information privacythreats in a fairly systematic manner. Overall, this paper contributes to researchers' theory-building efforts in the area of information privacy by breaking new ground for the study of individuals ' responses to information privacy threats.","Causal model; Ethical issues; Information privacy; Information privacy concerns; Responses to information privacy threats; Structural equation modeling","Management information systems; Causal model; Ethical issues; Information privacy; Information privacy concerns; Structural equation modeling; Taxonomies","","","","","","","Acquisto A., Friedman A., Telang R., Is There a Cost to Privacy Breaches?

The Information Systems (IS) unit within the business is largely responsible for meeting this challenge. Yet, current theory explains little about IS innovation and its role in organizational innovation in general. We suggest some needed foundations. IS innovations are posited to be of three types: Type I innovations confined to the IS task; Type II innovations supporting administration of the business; and Type III innovations imbedded in the core technology of the business. Diffusion among organizations is conjectured to occur by means of a communication circuit in which each IS unit is linked to its professional and business environments. Systematic differences in adoption and evolution patterns among IS innovation types are expected. Three specific IS innovations - data administration, the information center, and material requirements planning (MRP) - illustrate.","","Administrative data processing; Competition; Employment; Information management; Information services; Management science; Societies and institutions; Technology; Data administration; Information systems; Innovation; Innovation adoption and diffusion; Innovation evolution; Material requirements planning; Management information systems","","","","","","","","","","Inst of Management Sciences","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028494782"

By default, the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective, meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct. Many times, though, the nature of the construct is not reflective, but rather formative. Formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa. In this research, we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers. By examining complete volumes of MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the last 3 years, we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative constructs. For scientific results to be valid, we argue that researchers must properly specify formative constructs. This paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative constructs on both Type land Type II errors. To avoid these errors, the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative constructs. We also discuss how to address formative constructs within a research model after they are specified.","Composite constructs; Formative constructs; Latent constructs; Measurement models; Methodology;

We explore an alternate theory-based view of culture via social identity theory (SIT), which suggests that each individual is influenced by plethora of cultures and sub-cultures-some ethnic, some national, and some organizational. In IS research, the culture of subjects and respondents is problematic because it is typically an overly simplistic categorization. IS research nearly always assumes that an individual living in a particular place and time belongs to a single ""culture,"" e.g., someone living in Egypt is automatically classified as being a member of the Egyptian culture, or, more broadly, the Arab culture. This dearth of clear concepts and measures for ""culture"" may explain why cross-cultural research has been so exceedingly difficult to conduct. It may also explain why it has been hard to develop and refine theories. Moreover, it may give insight into why reasonable explained variance in predictive models has not been higher. Finally, it is very possible that much cross-cultural business research could be rightly accused of advancing an ""ecological fallacy"" by not recognizing the individual makeup of persons with respect to culture. Using SIT (or other theory bases) as grounding for cultural research programs implies the use of certain methodological approaches. Each study would have to establish the salient ""cultures"" in each individual's background and include these different ""cultures"" as independent variables in positivist research. In qualitative research, there would need to be an equally rigorous assessment of the cultural identifiers of each individual.","","Decision making; Decision support systems; Management information systems; Societies and institutions; Culture; Global information management; Social identity theory; Information technology","","","","","","","Brown R.J., Tajfel's contribution to the reduction of intergroup conflict, Social Groups and Identities: Developing the Legacy of Henri Tajfel, (1996); Cook T.D., Campbell D.T., Quasi-Experimentation: Design and Analysis Issues for Field Settings, (1979); Daft R.L., Lengel R.H., Trevino L.K., Message equivocality, media selection, and manager performance: Implications for informational systems, MIS Quarterly, 11, pp. 355-366, (1987); Deaux K., From individual differences to social categories.

We used interpretive in-depth case study research to study how a European financial services provider has formulated and implemented a DTS. By focusing on the underlying processes and strategizing activities, we show that digital strategy making not only represents a break with the conventions of upfront strategic information systems (IS) planning, but reveals a new extreme of emergent strategy making. Specifically, we conclude that a DTS is continuously in the making, with no foreseeable end. By building on theory from IS strategizing and strategy-as-practice literature, we theorize an integrated process/activity model that characterizes DTS formulation and implementation in pre-digital organizations. Our model shows that the crafting of a DTS is a highly dynamic process involving iterating between learning and doing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Digital transformation strategy; Financial services; Interpretive case study; IS strategizing","Information systems; Management information systems; Digital transformation; Emergent strategies; Financial service; Financial services providers; Interpretive case studies; Strategic information systems; Strategy as practices; Traditional industry; Finance","","","","","","","Arvidsson V., Holmstrom J., Lyytinen K., Information systems use as strategy practice: a multi-dimensional view of strategic information system implementation and use, J.

It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises. However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012. We approach social crises as communal efforts for community intelligence gathering and collective information processing to cope with and adapt to uncertain external situations. We explore two issues: (1) collective social reporting as an information processing mechanism to address crisis problems and gather community intelligence, and (2) the degeneration of social reporting into collective rumor mills. Our analysis reveals that information with no clear source provided was the most important, personal involvement next in importance, and anxiety the least yet still important rumor causing factor on Twitter under social crisis situations.","Community intelligence; Extreme events; Rumor theory; Social crisis; Social information processing; Social reporting; Twitter","Management information systems; Community intelligences; Extreme events; Rumor theory; Social crisis; Social information processing; Social reporting; Twitter; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Allen K., Sturcke J., Timeline: Toyota's recall woes, The Guardian, (2010); Allport G.W., Postman L., The Psychology of Rumor, (1947); Anthony S., Anxiety and rumor, The Journal of Social Psychology, 89, pp. 91-98, (1973); Berinato S., You have to lead from everywhere: An interview with Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (Ret.), Harvard Business Review, 88, 11, pp. 76-79, (2010); Bharosa N., Janssen M., Rao H.R., Lee J., Adaptive information orchestration: Architectural principles improving information quality,  International ISCRAM Conference, pp. 556-565, (2008); Bharosa N., Lee J., Janssen M., Challenges and obstacles in sharing and coordinating information during multi-agency disaster response: Propositions from field exercises, Information Systems Frontiers, 12, 1, pp. 49-65, (2010); Bordia P., Rumor Interaction Patterns on Computer-mediated Communication Networks, (1996); Bordia P., DiFonzo N., Rumor as group problem solving: Development patterns in informal computer-mediated groups, Small Research Group, 30, 8, pp. 8-28, (1999); Bordia P., DiFonzo N., Problem solving in social interactions on the internet: Rumor as social cognition, Social Psychology Quarterly, 67, 1, pp. 33-49, (2004); Buckner H.T., A theory of rumor transmission, The Public Opinion Quarterly, 29, 1, pp. 54-70, (1965); Chakraborty R., Agrawal M., Rao H.R., An exploratory study of information processing under stress: The case of mumbai police control and first responders during terrorist attacks of November 26, 2008, The Pre-ICIS ISGSEC Workshop on Information Security and Proviacy, (2010); Police: 'Hero' Saved Several Seattle Café Patrons as Gunman Opended Fire, (2012); Collins H.M., Tacit knowledge, trust and the Q of Sapphire, Social Studies of Science, 31, 1, pp. 71-85, (2001); DeLone W., McLean E.R., The delone and mclean model of information systems success: A ten-year update, Journal of Management Information Systems, 19, 4, pp. 9-30, (2003); DiFonzo N., Bordia P., Rumor transmission, Encyclopedia of Social Psychology, (2007); Durbin J., Watson G.S., Testing for serial correlation in least squares regression.

Firms are increasingly relying on information technologies, including process, knowledge, and communication technologies, to enhance their agility. The purpose of this paper is to broaden understanding about the strategic role of IT by examining the nomological network of influences through which IT impacts firm performance. By drawing upon recent thinking in the strategy, entrepreneurship, and IT management literatures, this paper uses a multitheoretic lens to argue that information technology investments and capabilities influence firm performance through three significant organizational capabilities (agility, digital options, and entrepreneurial alertness) and strategic processes (capability-building, entrepreneurial action, and coevolutionary adaptation). We also propose that these dynamic capabilities and strategic processes impact the ability of firms to launch many and varied competitive actions and that, in turn, these competitive actions are a significant antecedent of firm performance. Through our theorizing, we draw attention to a significant and reframed role of IT as a digital options generator in contemporary firms.","Digital options; It competence; Knowledge capital; Process capital;

This novel perspective has created the challenge of designing and managing a network of interdependent relationships developed and fostered through strategic collaboration. Although research interests in supply chain management (SCM) are growing, no research has been directed towards a systematic development of SCM instruments. This study identifies and consolidates various supply chain initiatives and factors to develop key SCM constructs conducive to advancing the field. To this end, we analyzed over 400 articles and synthesized the large, fragmented body of work dispersed across many disciplines. The result of this study, through successive stages of measurement analysis and refinement, is a set of reliable, valid, and unidimensional measurements that can be subsequently used in different contexts to refine or extend conceptualization and measurements or to test various theoretical models, paving the way for theory building in SCM. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we formally define the notion of IT-dependent strategic initiative and use it to frame a review of the literature on the sustainability of competitive advantage rooted in information systems use. We offer a framework that articulates both the dynamic approach to IT-dependent strategic advantage currently receiving attention in the literature and the underlying drivers of sustainability. This framework models how and why the characteristics of the IT-dependent strategic initiative enable sustained competitive advantage, and how the determinants of sustainability are developed and strengthened over time. Such explanation facilitates the pre-implementation analysis of planned initiatives by innovators, as well as the post-implementation evaluation of existing initiatives so as to identify the basis of their sustainability. In carrying out this study, we examined the interdisciplinary literature on strategic information systems. Using a structured methodology, we reviewed the titles and abstracts of 648 articles drawn from information systems, strategic management, and marketing literature. We then examined and individually coded a relevant subset of 117 articles. The literature has identified four barriers to erosion of competitive advantage for IT-dependent strategic initiatives and has surfaced the structural determinants of their magnitude. Previous work has also begun to theorize about the process by which these barriers to erosion evolve over time. Our review reveals that signifi cant exploratory research and theoretical development have occurred in this area, but there is a paucity of research providing rigorous tests of theoretical propositions. Our work makes three principal contributions. First, it formalizes the definition of IT-dependent strategic initiative. Second, it organizes the extant interdisciplinary research around an integrative framework that should prove useful to both research and practice. This framework offers an explanation of how and why IT-dependent strategic initiatives contribute to sustained competitive advantage, and explains the process by which they evolve over time. Finally, our review and analysis of the literature offers the basis for future research directions.","Competitive advantage; IT-dependent strategic initiatives; Strategic agility; Strategic information systems; Sustainable competitive advantage","Competitive intelligence; Economic and social effects; Management information systems; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; IT dependent strategic initiatives; Strategic agility; Strategic information systems; Sustainable competitive advantage; Information science","","","","","","","Amit R., Zott C., Value creation in e-business, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 6, pp. 493-520, (2001); Applegate L.M., Making the case for networked business, Corporate Information Strategy and Management, pp. 115-134, (2003); Armstrong A., Hagel J., The real value of on-line communities, Harvard Business Review, 74, 3, pp. 134-141, (1996); Atkins M.H., The role of appropriability in sustaining competitive advantage - An electronic auction system case study, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 7, 2, pp. 131-152, (1998); Attewell P., Technology diffusion and organizational learning: The case of business computing, Organization Science, 3, 1, pp. 1-19, (1992); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Looking inside for competitive advantage, Academy of Management Executive, 9, 4, pp. 49-61, (1995); Barney J., Organizational culture: Can it be a source of sustained competitive advantage, Academy of Management Review, 11, 3, pp. 656-664, (1986); Barton P.S., Peters D.H., The ASB bank: An IT case study in sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 1, 3, pp. 165-170, (1992); Benjamin R.I., Rockart J.F., Scott Morton M.S., Wyamn J., Information technology: A strategic opportunity, Sloan Management Review, 25, 3, pp. 3-14, (1984); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bharadwaj A.S., Varadarajan P.R., Fahy J., Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: A conceptual model and research propositions, Journal of Marketing, 57, 4, pp. 83-99, (1993); Brandenburger A.M., Stuart H.W., Value-based business strategy, Journal of Economics and Management Strategy, 5, 1, pp. 5-24, (1996); Broadbent M., Weill P., Management by maxim: How business and IT managers can create IT infrastructures, Sloan Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 77-92, (1997); Broadbent M., Weill P., Neo B.S., Strategic context and patterns of IT infrastructure capability, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 8, 2, pp. 157-187, (1999); Broadbent M., Weill P., St. Clair D., The implications of information technology infrastructure for business process redesign, MIS Quarterly, 23, 2, pp. 159-182, (1999); Brohman M.K., Watson R.T., Piccoli G., Parasuraman A., Data completeness: The key to narrowing the gap between your customer and you, Communications of the ACM, 46, 6, pp. 47-51, (2003); Brown C.L., Lattin J.M., Investigating the relationship between time in market and pioneering advantage, Management Science, 40, 10, pp. 1361-1370, (1994); Carr N., IT doesn't matter, Harvard Business Review, 81, 5, pp. 41-50, (2003); Cash J.I., Konsynski B.R., IS redraws competitive boundaries, Harvard Business Review, 63, 2, pp. 134-142, (1985); Chan Y.E., Why haven't we mastered alignment?

These two approaches have been developed in parallel and have not been reconciled or integrated. This paper develops an integrated research model that distinguishes beliefs and attitudes about the system (i.e., object-based beliefs and attitudes) from beliefs and attitudes about using the system (i.e., behavioral beliefs and attitudes) to build the theoretical logic that links the user satisfaction and technology acceptance literature. The model is then tested using a sample of 465 users from seven different organizations who completed a survey regarding their use of data warehousing software. The proposed model was supported, providing preliminary evidence that the two perspectives can and should be integrated. The integrated model helps build the bridge from design and implementation decisions to system characteristics (a core strength of the user satisfaction literature) to the prediction of usage (a core strength of the technology acceptance literature). © 2005 INFORMS.","Information quality; Information systems success; System quality; Technology acceptance model; Theory of reasoned action; User satisfaction","Computer software; Data warehouses; Decision making; Information technology; Investments; Societies and institutions; Information quality; Information systems success; System quality; Technology acceptance model; Theory of reasoned action; User satisfaction; Management information systems","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Prasad J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies, Decision Sci., 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Ajzen I., Nature and operation of attitudes, Annual Rev.

However, dominant DR thinking takes a technological view of the IT artifact, paying scant attention to its shaping by the organizational context. Consequently, existing DR methods focus on building the artifact and relegate evaluation to a subsequent and separate phase. They value technological rigor at the cost of organizational relevance, and fail to recognize that the artifact emerges from interaction with the organizational context even when its initial design is guided by the researchers' intent. We propose action design research (ADR) as a new DR method to address this problem. ADR reflects the premise that IT artifacts are ensembles shaped by the organizational context during development and use. The method conceptualizes the research process as containing the inseparable and inherently interwoven activities of building the IT artifact, intervening in the organization, and evaluating it concurrently. The essay describes the stages of ADR and associated principles that encapsulate its underlying beliefs and values. We illustrate ADR through a case of competence management at Volvo IT.","Action design research; Action research; Design research; Emergence; Ensemble artifact; Organizational intervention; Research method","Management information systems;

However, established groups (i.e., groups with a history of working together) can view and use the same technology differently from groups without any past experiences of working together. This study examines the relative influences of media condition and group cohesion on social presence, task participation, and group consensus. Results from a controlled laboratory experiment with 45 triads of college students working on a decision-making task showed that media condition (audio conferencing vs. desktop video-conferencing) has significantly smaller influences on social presence and task participation than group cohesion in established groups. The study found that influence of group cohesion over social presence is additive, rather than substitutive, to that of media condition. The study also established that task participation played a more important role than social presence in determining the degree of consensus among group members in computer-mediated communication environments.","Desktop videoconferencing; Group cohesion; Group consensus; Group history; Media richness; Social presence; Task participation","Decision making; Groupware; Research; Social aspects; Students; Video conferencing; Desktop videoconferencing; Group cohesion; Group consensus; Group history; Media richness; Social presence; Task participation; Management information systems","","","","","","","Abel M.J., Experiences in an exploratory distributed organization, Intellectual Teamwork: the Sociological and Technical Bases of Collaborative Work, pp. 489-510, (1990); Alavi M., Wheeler B.C., Valacich J.S., Using IT to reengineer business education: An exploratory investigation of collaborative telelearning, MIS Quarterly, 19, 3, pp. 293-312, (1995); Anson R., Bostrom R., Wynne B., An experiment assessing group support system and facilitator effects on meeting outcomes, Management Science, 41, 2, pp. 189-208, (1995); Barclay D., Higgins C., Thompson R., The partial least squares (PLS) approach to causal modeling, personal computer adoption and use as an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Bijker W.E., Of Bicycle, Bakelites, and Bulbs: Toward A Theory of Sociotechical Change, (1995); Burke K., Chidambaram L., How much bandwidth is enough?

Supply chain partners are (1) engaging in interlinked processes that enable rich (broad-ranging, high quality, and privileged) information sharing, and (2) building information technology infrastructures that allow them to process information obtained from their partners to create new knowledge. This study uncovers and examines the variety of supply chain partnership configurations that exist based on differences in capability platforms, reflecting varying processes and information systems. We use the absorptive capacity lens to build a conceptual framework that links these configurations with partner-enabled market knowledge creation. Absorptive capacity refers to the set of organizational routines and processes by which organizations acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge to produce dynamic organizational capabilities.","","Data processing;

However, why individuals help strangers in these electronic networks is not well understood: there is no immediate benefit to the contri butor, and free-riders are able to acquire the same knowledge as everyone else. To understand this paradox, we apply theories of collective action to examine how individual motivations and social capital influence knowledge contribution in electronic networks. This study reports on the activities of one electronic network supporting a professional legal association. Using archival, network, survey, and content analysis data, we empirically test a model of knowledge contribution. We find that people contribute their knowledge when they perceive that it enhances their professional reputations, when they have the experience to share, and when they are structurally embedded in the network. Surprisingly, contributions occur without regard to expectations of reciprocity from others or high levels of commitment to the network.","Electronic networks of practice; Knowledge management; Online communities; Social capital","Data structures; Embedded systems; Industrial economics; Knowledge engineering; Management information systems; Online systems; Problem solving; Electronic networks of practice; Knowledge management; Online communities; Social capital; Electronic communities","","","","","","","Ahuja M., Galletta D., Carley K., Individual centrality and performance in virtual R&D groups: An empirical study, Management Science, 49, 1, pp. 21-38, (2003); Alavi M., Leidner D., Knowledge management systems: Issues, challenges and benefits, Communication of the Association for Information Systems, 1, pp. 1-28, (1999); Allen T.J., Managing the Flow of Technology, (1977); Anand V., Glick W.H., Manz C.C., Thriving on the knowledge of outsiders: Tapping organizational social capital, Academy of Management Executive, 16, 1, pp. 87-101, (2002); Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action, (1986); Barclay D., Higgins C., Thompson R., The Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to causal modeling: Personal computer adoption and use as an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Blau P.M., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Borgatti S., Everett M.G., Freeman L.C., UCINET 5 for Windows, (1999); Bouty I., Interpersonal and interaction influences on informal resource exchanges between R&D researchers across organizational boundaries, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 1, pp. 50-66, (2000); Brown J.S., Duguid P., Knowledge and organization: A social-practice perspective, Organization Science, 12, 2, pp. 198-213, (2001); Brown J.S., Duguid P., Organizational learning and communities-of-practice: Toward a unified view of working, learning, and innovation, Organization Science, 2, 1, pp. 40-57, (1991); Brown J.S., Duguid P., The Social Life of Information, (2000); Burt R.S., Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, (1992); Butler B.S., Membership size, communication activity, and sustainability: A resource-based model of online social structures, Information Systems Research, 12, 4, pp. 346-362, (2001); Chin W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling, Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336, (1998); Chin W.W., Frye T., PLS Graph, 2.91, (1996); Chin W.W., Todd P.A., On the use, usefulness, and ease of use of structural equation modeling in MIS research: A note of caution, MIS Quarterly, 19, 2, pp. 237-246, (1995); Cohen B.P., Zhou X., Status processes in enduring work groups, American Sociological Review, 56, pp. 179-188, (1991); Cohen D., Prusak L., In Good Company: How Social Capital Makes Organizations Work, (2001); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (1988); Cohen J.A., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Coleman J.S., Foundations of Social Theory, (1990); Constant D., Sproull L., Kiesler S., The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice, Organization Science, 7, 2, pp. 119-135, (1996); DeSanctis G., Monge P., Communication processes for virtual organizations, Organization Science, 10, 6, pp. 693-703, (1999); Donath J.S., Identity and deception in the virtual community, Communities in Cyberspace, pp. 29-59, (1999); Ekeh P.P., Social Exchange Theory: The Two Traditions, (1974); Fornell C., Larcker D., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 39-50, (1981); Fukuyama F., Trust.

Implications include the possibility that information technology plays the role of a jealous mistress when it comes to the development and ownership of valuable knowledge in organizations; that is, information technology may destabilize the relationship between organizations and their employees when it comes to the transfer of knowledge.

They allow companies to replace their existing information systems, which are often incompatible with one another, with a single, integrated system. By streamlining data flows throughout an organization, these commercial software packages, offered by vendors like SAP, promise dramatic gains in a company's efficiency and bottom line. It's no wonder that businesses are rushing to jump on the ES bandwagon. But while these systems offer tremendous rewards, the risks they carry are equally great. Not only are the systems expensive and difficult to implement, they can also tie the hands of managers. Unlike computer systems of the past, which were typically developed in-house with a company's specific requirements in mind, enterprise systems are off-the-shelf solutions. They impose their own logic on a company's strategy, culture, and organization, often forcing companies to change the way they do business. Managers would do well to heed the horror stories of failed implementations. FoxMeyer Drug, for example, claims that its system helped drive it into bankruptcy. Drawing on examples of both successful and unsuccessful ES projects, the author discusses the pros and cons of implementing an enterprise system, showing how a system can produce unintended and highly disruptive consequences. Because of an ES's profound business implications, he cautions against shifting responsibility for its adoption to technologists. Only a general manager will be able to mediate between the imperatives of the system and the imperatives of the business.","","Accounting; Commerce; Equipment and Supplies; Evaluation Studies; Information Management; Maintenance; Management Information Systems; Marketing of Health Services; Organizational Culture; Personnel Management; Software; Systems Integration; United States; accounting; apparatus, equipment and supplies; article; commercial phenomena; computer program; economics; evaluation; financial management; hospital service; information system; organization; organization and management; personnel management; system analysis; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00178012","","","10181586","English","Harv Bus Rev","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032112063"

Researchers have investigated knowledge management factors such as enablers, processes, and performance. However, most current empirical research has explored the relationships between these factors in isolation. To fill this gap, this paper develops a research model that interconnects knowledge management factors. The model includes seven enablers: collaboration, trust, learning, centralization, formalization, T-shaped skills, and information technology support. The emphasis is on knowledge creation processes such as socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization. To establish credibility between knowledge creation and performance, organizational creativity is incorporated into the model. Surveys collected from 58 firms were analyzed to test the model. The results confirmed the impact of trust on knowledge creation. The information technology support had a positive impact on knowledge combination only. Organizational creativity was found to be critical for improving performance; neglecting ideas can undermine a business. The results may be used as a stepping stone for further empirical research and can help formulate robust strategies that involve trade-offs between knowledge management enablers.","Knowledge management; Knowledge management enablers; Knowledge-creating processes; Organizational creativity; Organizational performance","Information technology; Knowledge engineering; Societies and institutions; Knowledge management; Management information systems","","","","","","","Adler P., Goldoftas B., Levine D., Flexibility versus efficiency?

Price College of Business, University of Oklahoma, United States","IT governance arrangements refers to the patterns of authority for key IT activities in business firms, including IT infrastructure, IT use, and project management. During the last 20 years, three primary modes of IT governance have become prevalent: centralized, decentralized, and the federal mode. These modes vary in the extent to which corporate IS, divisional IS, and line management are vested with authority for the key IT activities. While a significant volume of research has examined the influence of contingency factors on the choice of a specific mode of IT governance, most of this research has examined the singular effects of the contingency factors. The assumption underlying these studies is as though the organizational contingencies act in isolation in influencing the mode of IT governance. However, in reality, business firms are subject to the pulls and pressures of multiple, rather than singular, contingency forces. Therefore, to acknowledge this reality, this study applies the theory of multiple contingencies to examine how contingency forces influence the mode of IT governance. The theory argues that contingency forces interact with each other by either amplifying, dampening, or overriding their mutual influences on the IT governance mode. Three scenarios of multiple, interacting contingencies are identified: reinforcing, conflicting, and dominating. Each of these scenarios of multiple contingencies is hypothesized to influence a particular mode of IT governance. Utilizing rich data from case studies of eight firms, empirical evidence is presented to support these hypotheses. Implications of the multiple contingencies theory for research and for practice are presented.","Federal governance; IS organization design; Multiple contingencies; Qualitative research","Computer software; Data reduction; Decision making; Management; Management information systems; Project management; Research; Federal governance; IS organizational design; Multiple contingencies; Qualitative research; Information technology","","","","","","","Ahituv N., Neumann S., Zviran M., Factors affecting the policy for distributing computing resources, MIS Quarterly, 13, 4, pp. 389-401, (1989); Applegate L.M., McFarlan F.W., McKenney J.L., Corporate Information Systems Management: Text and Cases, 4th Ed., (1996); Bastien D.T., Common patterns of behavior and communication in corporate mergers and acquisitions, Human Resource Management, 26, 1, pp. 17-33, (1987); Zmud R.W., Building relationships throughout the corporate entity, Transforming the IS Organization: The Mission, the Framework, the Transition, (1988)","V.

To date, however, the literature appears to have arrived at few conclusions with regard to the performance of the two representations. This paper addresses these issues by presenting a theory, based on information processing theory, to explain under what circumstances one representation outperforms the other. The fundamental aspects of the theory are: (1) although graphical and tabular representations may contain the same information, they present that information in fundamentally different ways; graphical representations emphasize spatial information, while tables emphasize symbolic information; (2) tasks can be divided into two types, spatial and symbolic, based on the type of information that facilitates their solution; (3) performance on a task will be enhanced when there is a cognitive fit (match) between the information emphasized in the representation type and that required by the task type; that is, when graphs support spatial tasks and when tables support symbolic tasks; (4) the processes or strategies problem solvers use are the crucial elements of cognitive fit since they provide the link between representation and task; the processes identified here are perceptual and analytical; (5) so long as there is a complete fit of representation, processes, and task type, each representation will lead to both quicker and more accurate problem solving. The theory is validated by its success in explaining the results of published studies that examine the performance of graphical and tabular representations in decision making.

It posits that mimetic, coercive, and normative pressures existing in an institutionalized environment could influence organizational predisposition toward an information technology-based interorganizational linkage. Survey-based research was carried out to test this theory. Following questionnaire development, validation, and pretest with a pilot study, data were collected from the CEO, the CFO, and the CIO to measure the institutional pressures they faced and their intentions to adopt financial electronic data interchange (FEDI). A firm-level structural model was developed based on the CEO's, the CFO's, and the CIO's data. LISREL and PLS were used for testing the measurement and structural models respectively. Results showed that all three institutional pressures -mimetic pressures, coercive pressures, and normative pressures - had a significant influence on organizational intention to adopt FEDI. Except for perceived extent of adoption among suppliers, all other subconstructs were significant in the model. These results provide strong support for institutional-based variables as predictors of adoption intention for interorganizational linkages. These findings indicate that organizations are embedded in institutional networks and call for greater attention to be directed at understanding institutional pressures when investigating information technology innovations adoption.","Coercive pressures; Financial electronic data interchange; Institutional influences; Interorganizational systems; Mimetic pressures; Normative pressures","Electronic commerce; Electronic data interchange; Finance; Information technology; Research and development management; Financial electronic data interchange (FEDI); Technical efficiency; Value-added networks; Management information systems","","","","","","","Abrahamson E., Managerial fads and fashions: The diffusion and rejection of innovations, Academy of Management Review, 16, 3, pp. 586-612, (1991); Abrahamson E., Rosenkopf L., Institutional and competitive bandwagons: Using mathematical modeling as a tool to explore innovation diffusion, Academy of Management Review, 18, 3, pp. 487-517, (1993); Anderson J.C., An approach for confirmatory measurement and structural equation modeling of organizational properties, Management Science, 33, 4, pp. 525-541, (1987); Azjen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Behavior, (1980); Bagozzi R.P., Causal Models in Marketing, (1980); Bagozzi R.P., Fornell C., Theoretical concepts, measurement, and meaning, A Second Generation of Multivariate Analysis, 2, (1982); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., Phillips L.W., Assessing construct validity in organizational research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 3, pp. 421-458, (1991); Banker R.D., Kaufmann R., Strategic contributions of information technology: An empirical study of ATM networks, Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 141-150, (1988); Barclay D.C., Higgins C., Thompson R., The partial least squares approach to causal modeling: Personal computer adoption and use as an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-308, (1995); Bentler P.M., Comparative fit indices in structural model, Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 238-246, (1990); Bouchard L., Decision criteria in the adoption of EDI, Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 365-376, (1993); Burns L.R., Wholey B.R., Adoption and abandonment of matrix management programs: Effects of organizational characteristics and interorganizational networks, Academy of Management Journal, 36, 1, pp. 106-138, (1993); Burt R.S., Social contagion and innovation: Cohesion versus structural equivalence, American Journal of Sociology, 92, 6, pp. 1287-1335, (1987); Burt R.S., Toward A Structural Theory of Action: Network Models of Social Structure, Perception, and Action, (1982); Cash J.I., McFarlan F.W., McKenney J.L., Applegate L.M., Corporate Information Systems Management: Text and Cases, (1992); Carroll G.R., Delacroix J., Organizational mortality in the newspaper industries of argentina and ireland: An ecological approach, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, 1, pp. 169-198, (1982); Chin W.W., Issues and opinions on structural equation modeling, MIS Quarterly, 22, 1, pp. 7-16, (1998); Chwelos P., Benbasat I., Dexter A., Empirical test of an EDI adoption model, Information Systems Research, 12, 3, pp. 304-322, (2001); Clemons E.K., MAC - Philadelphia national bank's strategic venture in shared ATM networks, Journal of Management Information Systems, 7, 1, pp. 5-25, (1990); Contractor N.S., Eisenberg E.M., Communication networks and new media in organizations, Organizations and Communication Technology, pp. 143-172, (1990); Copeland D.G., McKenney J.L., Airline reservation systems: Lessons from history, MIS Quarterly, 12, 3, pp. 353-370, (1988); Cyert R.M., March J.G., A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, (1963); Damanpour F., Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators, Academy of Management Journal, 34, 3, pp. 555-590, (1991); Davis G.F., Agents without principles?

Researchers have shown that a firm's ability to effectively leverage its IT investments by developing a strong IT capability can result in improved firm performance. We test the robustness of this approach and examine several related issues. Our results indicate that firms with superior IT capability indeed exhibit superior current and sustained firm performance when compared to average industry performance, even after adjusting for effects of prior firm performance. However, the differences in the results from various analyses suggest that the impact of ""halo effects"" and prior financial performance of firms must be taken into consideration in future tests of IT capability. Further, it is critical to develop theoretically derived multidimensional measures of IT capability in order to continue to apply the RBV approach to assess the impact of IT investments on firm performance.","Firm performance; IT capability; Resource-based view","Computer software; Economics; Information technology; Investments; Product development; Firm performance; Information technology (IT) capability; Resource-based view; Management information systems","","","","","","","Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Benbasat I., Zmud R.W., Empirical research in information systems: The practice of relevance, MIS Quarterly, 23, 1, pp. 3-16, (1999); Berthon P., Pitt L., Ewing M., Carr C.L., Potential research space in MIS: A framework for envisioning and evaluating research replication, extension and generation, Information Systems Research, 13, 4, pp. 416-427, (2002); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bharadwaj A., Sambamurthy V., Zmud R.W., IT capabilities: Theoretical perspectives and empirical operationalization,  International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 378-385, (1999); Brown B., Perry S., Removing the financial performance halo from fortune's most admired companies, Academy of Management Journal, 37, 5, pp. 1347-1359, (1994); Brynjolfsson E., Hitt L.M., Beyond the productivity paradox, Communications of the ACM, 41, 8, pp. 49-55, (1998); Chan Y., IT value: The great divide between qualitative and quantitative and individual and organizational measures, Journal of Management Information Systems, 16, 4, pp. 225-261, (2000); Clemons E.K., Row M.C., Sustaining IT advantage: The role of structural differences, MIS Quarterly, 15, 3, pp. 275-292, (1991); Dreyfus J., IW 500: A methodology, Information Week, (1994); Duliba K.A., Kauffman R.J., Lucas Jr. H.C., Appropriating value from CRS ownership in the airline industry, Organization Science, 12, 6, pp. 702-728, (2001); Fama E.F., French K.R., Forecasting profitability and earnings, The Journal of Business, 73, 2, pp. 161-175, (2000); Grant R.M., The resource-based theory of competitive advantage: Implications for strategy formulation, California Management Review, 33, 3, pp. 114-135, (1991); Hitt L., Brynjolfsson E., Productivity, business profitability, and consumer surplus: Three different measures of information technology value, MIS Quarterly, 20, 2, pp. 121-142, (1996); Ives B., Editor's comment: Probing the productivity paradox, MIS Quarterly, 18, 2, (1994); Lucas H., Information Technology and the Productivity Paradox: Assessing the Value of Investing in IT, (1999); Mahmood M.A., Mann G.J., Special issue: Impacts of information technology investment on organizational performance, Journal of Management Information Systems, 16, 4, pp. 3-10, (2000); Makadok R., Toward a synthesis of the resource-based and dynamic-capability views of rent creation, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 5, pp. 387-401, (2001); Martinsons M.G., Martinsons V., Rethinking the value of IT, again, Communications of the ACM, 45, 7, pp. 25-26, (2002); Mata F.J., Fuerst W.L., Barney J.B., Information technology and sustained competitive Advantage: A resource-based analysis, MIS Quarterly, 19, 4, pp. 487-505, (1995); Neter J., Kutner M.H., Nachtsheim C.J., Wasserman W.,  Ed.), (1996); Robbins D.K., Pearce J.A., Turnaround, retrenchment and recovery, Strategic Management Journal, 13, 4, pp. 287-310, (1992); Rosenthal R., Replication in behavioral research, Replication Research in the Social Sciences, pp. 1-30, (1991); Ross J.W., Beath C.M., Develop long-term competitiveness through IT assets, Sloan Management Review, 38, 1, pp. 31-42, (1996); Sambamurthy V., Research in information systems: What we haven't learned, MIS Quarterly, 25, 4, pp. 10-11, (2001); Teece D.J., Pisano G., Shuen A., Dynamic capabilities and strategic management, Strategic Management Journal, 18, 7, pp. 509-533, (1997); Tsang E.W.K., Kwan K.M., Replication and theory development in organizational science: A critical realist perspective, Academy of Management Review, 24, 4, pp. 759-780, (1999); Weill P., Olson M.H., Managing investment in information technology: Mini case examples and implications, MIS Quarterly, 13, 1, pp. 2-17, (1989); Wisner J.D., Eakins S.G., A performance assessment of the US baldridge quality award winners, The International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 11, 2, pp. 8-26, (1994)","R.

In this setting, inbound orders from a downstream member serve as a valuable informational input to upstream production and inventory decisions. This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of ""orders"" tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and the distortion tends to increase as one moves upstream - a phenomenon termed ""bullwhip effect."" This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations. Actions that can be taken to mitigate the detrimental impact of this distortion are also discussed.","Information Distortion; Information Integration; Production and Inventory Management; Supply Chain Management","Decision making; Management information systems; Marketing; Operations research; Production; Information distortion; Supply chain management; Management science","","","","","","","Abel A.B., Inventories, Stockouts and Production Smoothing, Rev.

Prior research has argued that business-IT strategic alignment facilitates business effect of IT and that contextual factors affect business-IT alignment. However, the role of knowledge considerations in the relationship between contextual factors and alignment, and the role of IT projects in the relationship between alignment and business effects of IT, have not been explicitly examined. Therefore, this paper pursues the following two research questions: (1) Based on knowledge considerations, how do planning behaviors (specifically, IT managers' participation in business planning and business managers' participation in IT planning) and top management knowledge of IT mediate the effects of two contextual factors - organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions - on business-IT strategic alignment? (2) How do aspects of IT projects (specifically, quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects) mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effects of IT? Results from a survey of 274 senior information officers indicate that organizational emphasis on knowledge management and centralization of IT decisions affect top managers' knowledge of IT, which facilitates business managers' participation in strategic IT planning and IT managers' participation in business planning, and both of these planning behaviors affect business-IT strategic alignment. Moreover, the results indicate that quality of IT project planning and implementation problems in IT projects mediate the relationship between business-IT strategic alignment and business effect of IT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the planning and implementation of IT projects when examining the effects of business-IT strategic alignment, and highlight the importance of considering shared domain knowledge (i.e., top managers' knowledge of IT) and planning behaviors when examining the effects of contextual factors on business-IT strategic alignment. Managers can use these results to develop more comprehensive action plans for achieving greater business-IT strategic alignment, and for translating alignment into enhanced IT effects on business performance. © 2007 M.E.

The article went on to suggest the use of an IS-context-modified version of the SERVQUAL instrument to assess the quality of the services supplied by an information services provider (Parasuraman et al. 1985, 1988, 1991).2 However, a number of problems with the SERVQUAL instrument have been discussed in the literature (e.g., Babakus and Boiler 1992; Carman 1990; Cronin and Taylor 1992, 1994; Teas 1993). This article reviews that literature and discusses some of the implications for measuring service quality in the information systems context. Findings indicate that SERVQUAL suffers from a number of conceptual and empirical difficulties. Conceptual difficulties include the operationalization of perceived service quality as a difference or gap score, the ambiguity of the expectations construct, and the unsuitably of using a single measure of service quality across different industries. Empirical problems, which may be linked to the use of difference scores, include reduced reliability, poor convergent validity, and poor predictive validity. This suggests that (1) some alternative to difference scores is preferable and should be utilized; (2) if used, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of IS-SERVQUAL difference scores; and (3) further work is needed in the development of measures for assessing the quality of IS services.","Evaluation; Is management; Measurement; Service quality; User attitudes; User expectations","Behavioral research; Evaluation; Measurement theory; Personnel rating; Problem solving; Quality of service; IS management; Service quality; User attitudes; User expectations; Management information systems","","","","","","","Babakus E., Boiler G.W., An empirical assessment of the SERVQUAL scale, Journal of Business Research, 24, 3, pp. 253-268, (1992); Bagozzi R., Davis F., Warshaw P., Development and test of a theory of Technological learning and usage, Human Relations, 45, 7, pp. 659-686, (1992); Gronroos C., A service quality model and its marketing implications, European Journal of Marketing, 18, 4, pp. 36-55, (1984); Johns G., Difference score measures of organizational behavior variables: A critique, Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 27, pp. 443-463, (1981); Kappelman L., Measuring user involvement: A diffusion of innovation approach, The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, 26, 2-3, pp. 65-83, (1995)","T.P.

This paper details the development and empirical validation of a model of software piracy by individuals in the workplace. The model was developed from the results of prior research into software piracy, and the reference disciplines of the theory of planned behavior, expected utility theory, and deterrence theory. A survey of 201 respondents was used to test the model. The results indicate that individual attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are significant precursors to the intention to illegally copy software. In addition, punishment severity, punishment certainty, and software cost have direct effects on the individual's attitude toward software piracy, whereas punishment certainty has a significant effect on perceived behavioral control. Consequently, strategies to reduce software piracy should focus on these factors. The results add to a growing stream of information systems research into illegal software copying behavior and have significant implications for organizations and industry groups aiming to reduce software piracy.","Computer ethics; Deterrence theory; Expected utility theory; Software piracy; Theory of planned behavior","Computer crime; Computer software; Computers; Information science; Computer ethics; Management information systems","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32, 4, pp. 665-683, (2002); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Attitude-behavior relation: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research, Psychological Bulletin, 84, 5, pp. 888-918, (1977); Ajzen I., Madden T.J., Prediction of goal-directed behavior: Attitudes, intentions and perceived behavioral control, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 22, 5, pp. 453-474, (1986); Armitage C.J., Conner M., The theory of planned behavior, British Journal of Social Psychology, 40, 4, pp. 471-499, (2001); Barclay D., Higgins C., Thompson R., The partial least squares approach to causal modeling: Personal computer adoption and use as an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Beck L., Ajzen I., Predicting dishonest actions using the theory of planned behavior, Journal of Research in Personality, 25, 3, pp. 285-301, (1991); Forecasting a Robust Future: An Economic Study of the U.S. Software Industry, (1999); 2000 Global Software Piracy Report, (2001); Chen Y., Png I.P.L., Software pricing and copyright enforcement: Private vis-à-vis social welfare, Proceedings of the Twentieth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 119-123, (1999); Cheng H., Sims R., Teegen H., To purchase or to pirate software: An empirical study, Journal of Management Information Systems, 13, 4, pp. 49-60, (1997); Chin W.W., The partial least squares approach for structural equation modeling, Modern Methods for Business Research, pp. 295-336, (1998); Christensen A., Eining M., Factors influencing software piracy: Implications for accountants, Journal of Information Systems, 5, 1, pp. 67-80, (1991); Conner K.R., Rumelt R.P., Software piracy: An analysis of protection strategies, Management Science, 3, 2, pp. 125-139, (1991); Cronbach L., Test validation, Educational Measurement, 2d Ed., (1971); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Ehrlich I., Participation in illegitimate activities: A theoretical and empirical investigation, Journal of Political Economy, 81, 3, pp. 521-565, (1973); Ehrlich I., Crime, punishment, and the market for offenses, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 10, 1, pp. 43-67, (1996); Eining M., Christensen A., A psycho-social model of software piracy: The development and test of a model, Ethical Issues in Information Systems, pp. 182-187, (1991); Falk R.F., Miller N.B., A Primer for Soft Modeling, (1992); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, attitude, intention and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, 1975; Fornell C., A Second Generation of Multivariate Analysis, Methods: Vol. 1, 1, (1982); Fornell C., Larcker D.F., Structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement errors, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 1, pp. 39-50, (1981); Givon M., Mahajan V., Muller E., Software piracy: Estimation of lost sales and impact on software diffusion, Journal of Marketing, 59, 1, pp. 29-37, (1995); Gopal R., Sanders G., Preventive and deterrent controls for software piracy, Journal of Management Information Systems, 13, 4, pp. 29-47, (1997); Gopal R., Sanders G., International software piracy: Analysis of key issues and impacts, Information Systems Research, 9, 4, pp. 380-397, (1998); Gopal R., Sanders G., Global software piracy: You can't get blood out of a turnip, Communications of the ACM, 43, 9, pp. 83-89, (2000); Hair J.F.

The nature of ISDTs is articulated using Dubin's concept of theory building and Simon's idea of a science of the artificial. An example of an ISDT is presented in the context of Executive Information Systems (EIS). Despite the increasing awareness of the potential of EIS for enhancing executive strategic decisionmaking effectiveness, there exists little theoretical work which directly guides EIS design. We contend that the underlying theoretical basis of EIS can be addressed through a design theory of vigilant information systems. Vigilance denotes the ability of an information system to help an executive remain alertly watchful for weak signals and discontinuities in the organizational environment relevant to emerging strategic threats and opportunities. Research on managerial information scanning and emerging issue tracking as well as theories of open loop control are synthesized to generate vigilant information system design theory propositions. Transformation of the propositions into testable empirical hypotheses is discussed. Copyright © 1992.

Drawing on the elaboration-likelihood model (ELM), we compared two alternative influence processes, the central and peripheral routes, in motivating IT acceptance. These processes were respectively operationalized using the argument quality and source credibility constructs, and linked to perceived usefulness and attitude, the core perceptual drivers of IT acceptance. We further examined how these influence processes were moderated by users' IT expertise and perceived job relevance and the temporal stability of such influence effects. Nine hypotheses thus developed were empirically validated using a field survey of document management system acceptance at an eastern European governmental agency. This study contributes to the IT acceptance literature by introducing ELM as a referent theory for acceptance research, by elaborating alternative modes of influence, and by specifying factors moderating their effects. For practitioners, this study introduces influence processes as policy tools that managers can employ to motivate IT acceptance within their organizations, benchmarks alternative influence strategies, and demonstrates the need for customizing influence strategies to the specific needs of a user population.","Attitude;

Organizations in these environments have to be agile in order to adapt their strategies and actions to be successful. While it is recognized that information technology can enable firms to be agile, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms through and the contexts in which Information Technology (IT) enhances agility. This study examines two key antecedents of organizational agility, namely the IT competence of a firm and its innovation capacity and, examine their independent and joint effects on agility. We test our model using data collected from large firms in the US. The results provide strong support for our model. We found that firms with superior IS capabilities coupled with an aggressive IT investment orientation create digital platforms that enable them to be agile. We also found that the innovation capacity of the firm has a positive relationship with organizational agility and that firms with higher innovation capacity are better able to leverage their digital platforms to enhance agility. Our results indicate that organizational agility has a strong positive impact of firm performance.

Anecdotal evidence in the business press points to limited satisfaction among users of ASP, which calls for an assessment of determinants of satisfaction with ASP. In this paper, we draw upon the consumer satisfaction paradigm widely employed in marketing literature to analyze post-usage satisfaction with ASP services. We develop a conceptual model of satisfaction with ASP and empirically test the predictions using data from 256 firms using ASP services. Expectations about ASP service have a significant influence on the performance evaluation of ASPs, and experience-based norms have only limited significance in explaining satisfaction with ASP. We also find empirical support for the influence of performance and disconfirmation on the satisfaction with ASP. Implications for both ASPs and organizations adopting ASP services are discussed.","Applications software; Causal models; Empirical research; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Management Information Systems;

Design/methodology/approach - The project used a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The grounded theory approach was used to analyze responses to open-ended questions answered by 220 certified information system security professionals. Using these responses, a survey instrument was developed. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - Evidence suggests that top management support is a significant predictor of an organization's security culture and level of policy enforcement. Research limitations/implications - During instrument validation, a special effort removed survey items that appeared overly intrusive to the respondents. In this endeavor, an expert panel of security practitioners evaluated all candidate items on a willingness-to-answer scale. While especially helpful in security, this scale may be used in other research domains. Practical implications - Practitioners should understand the impact of top management support on achieving security effectiveness. Based on the findings of this study, low levels of executive support will produce an organizational culture less tolerant of good security practices. Low levels of support will diminish the level of enforcement of existing security policies. Originality/value - Researchers developed original scales to measure levels of top management support, policy enforcement, and organizational culture. The scales demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity scores. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Information control; Management effectiveness; Organizational culture; Surveys","Law enforcement; Mathematical models; Professional aspects; Public policy; Security of data; Information control; Management effectiveness; Organizational culture; Management information systems","","","","","","","Allen B., Danger ahead!

Adopting trust-building foundations from cross-culture literature and focusing on a set of well-established cultural constructs as groups of culture (Type I and Type II), this study develops a theoretical model of self-perception- based versus transference-based consumer trust in e-vendors, and empirically tests the model using cross-cultural data. The results show that transference-based trust determinants (i.e., ""perceived importance of third-party seal"" and ""perceived importance of positive referral"") are more positively related to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type II (i.e., collectivist-strong uncertainty avoidance-high long-term orientation-high context) culture than in a Type I (i.e., individualistic-weak uncertainty avoidance-low long-term orientation-low context) culture. Unlike the initial hypothesized expectations, self-perception-based trust determinants (i.e., perceived security protection, perceived privacy concern, and perceived system reliability) do not show stronger roles to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture, although the stronger negative effect of perceived privacy concerns is observed on consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture. Theoretical contributions for e-commerce cross-culture literature and implications for multinational online business managers are discussed. © 2008 M.E.

It is now over a decade since the first study was published, during which several significant developments in the IT industry have taken place. Unlike the 1990s, when proprietary information systems prevailed, the 2000s are characterized by more standardized and homogeneous information systems and with the rapid adoption of ERP and web technologies. Thus, we attempted to reexamine the link between IT capability and firm performance with data from the 2000s. Surprisingly, the results of our current analysis showed no significant link between IT capability and firm performance. Contrary to earlier studies, IT leader firms in our study didn't show better financial performance than control firms. We discuss several possible causes for the change in findings and present an in-depth comparison in business performance between the two groups-IT leader and control-over a period extending from 1991 to 2007.","Firm performance; IT business value; IT capability; IW 500","Management information systems; Business performance; Financial performance; Firm Performance; IT business values; IT Capabilities; IW 500; Proprietary information; Web technologies; Information systems","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Aghion P., Lelarge C., Van Reenen J., Zilibotti F., Technology, Information, and the Decentralization of the Firm, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122, 4, pp. 1759-1799, (2007); Bakos Y., A strategic analysis of electronic marketplaces, MIS Quarterly, 15, 3, pp. 295-310, (1991); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bartel A., Ichniowski C., Shaw K., How does information technology affect productivity?

To examine the alignment paradox, we conducted a meta-analysis that probed the interrelationships between alignment, performance, and context constructs. We found the alignment dimensions (intellectual, operational, and cross-domain) demonstrate unique relationships with the different performance types (financial performance, productivity, and customer benefit) and with many of the other constructs in alignment's nomological network. All mean corrected correlations between dimensions of alignment and dependent variables were positive and most of the credibility interval values in these analyses were also positive. Overall, the evidence gathered from the extant literature suggests there is not much of an alignment paradox. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying the relationships between alignment and performance outcomes and offering insight into sources of inconsistencies in alignment research.

Existing research makes the universalistic assumption that both outcomes will always be realized through firms' IT asset portfolios. There has been limited research on the conditions under which firms' IT asset portfolios should be oriented more toward efficiency or innovation. Here, we argue that the nature of the industry where a firm competes will have a significant moderating effect on the link between firms' IT asset portfolios and efficiency or innovation outcomes. Using panel data that covers a wide range of industry environments, we find that at lower levels of dynamism, munificence, and complexity, IT asset portfolios are associated with a greater increase in efficiency. In contrast, in environments with higher levels of complexity, IT asset portfolios are associated with a greater increase in innovation (i.e., development of new products and processes, and exploration of growth opportunities). These results provide insights about how firms could realize strategic alignment by tailoring their IT asset portfolios toward an efficiency or innovation focus.","Competitive environment; Complexity; Dynamism; Efficiency; Exploitation; Exploration; Innovation; IT asset portfolio; IT value; Munificence","Management information systems; Natural resources exploration; Competitive environment; Complexity; Dynamism; Exploitation; It asset portfolios; IT value; Munificence; Efficiency","","","","","","","Quick Service' Performance Analysis Keeps the Dough Rising at Papa John's, (2005); Aral S., Weill P., It assets, organizational capabilities and firm performance: How resource allocations and organizational differences explain performance variation, Organization Science, 18, pp. 763-780, (2007); Banker R.D., Bardhan I.R., Hsihui C., Shu L., Plant information systems, manufacturing capabilities, and plant performance, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 2, pp. 315-337, (2006); Bartelsman E.J., Caballero R.J., Lyons R.K., Customer-and supplier-driven externalities, American Economic Review, 84, 4, pp. 1075-1084, (1999); Barua A., Konana P., Whinston A., Yin F., An empirical investigation of net-enabled business value, MIS Quarterly, 28, 4, pp. 585-620, (2004); Barua A., Kriebel C.H., Mukhopadhyay T., Information technology and business value: An analytic and empirical investigation, Information Systems Research, 6, 1, pp. 3-23, (1995); Barua A., Lee B., The information technology productivity paradox revisited: A theoretical and empirical investigation in the manufacturing sector, International Journal of Flexible Manufacturing Systems, 9, 2, pp. 145-166, (1997); Berianato S., Room for two, CIO, pp. 82-88, (2002); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 676-706, (2002); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Berndt E.R., Morrison C.J., High-tech capital and economic performance in u.s.

However, sifting through the myriad of content available through KMSs can be challenging, and knowledge workers may be over-whelmed when trying to find the content most relevant for completing a new task. To address this problem, KMS designers often include content rating schemes (i.e., users of the KMS submit ratings to indicate the quality of specific content used) and credibility indicators (indicators describing the validity of the content and/or the ratings) to improve users'search and evaluation of KMS content. This study examines how content ratings and credibility indicators affect KMS users' search and evaluation processes and decision performance (how well and how quickly users selected alternatives offered by the KMS). Four interrelated laboratory experiments provide evidence that ratings have a strong influence on KMS search and evaluation processes, which in turn affects decision performance. Finally, this study demonstrates that certain credibility indicators can moderate the relationship between rating validity and KMS content search and evaluation processes.","Content ratings; Credibility indicators; Decision making; Knowledge management systems; Knowledge usage","Decision making; Enterprise resource planning; Information use; Resource allocation; Content ratings; Credibility indicators; Knowledge management systems; Knowledge usage; Management information systems","","","","","","","Anonymous.

News posts on social media focus users’ attention on the headlines, but does it matter who wrote the article? We investigate whether changing the presentation format to highlight the source of the article affects its believability and how social media users choose to engage with it. We conducted two experiments and found that nudging users to think about who wrote the article influenced the extent to which they believed it. The presentation format of highlighting the source had a main effect; it made users more skeptical of all articles, regardless of the source’s credibility. For unknown sources, low source ratings had a direct effect on believability. Believability, in turn, influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). We also found confirmation bias to be rampant: users were more likely to believe articles that aligned with their beliefs, over and above the effects of other factors. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

However, for a variety of reasons, such teams are often unable develop and enact agility in dealing with changing situations. This paper seeks to provide a deeper understanding of agility through an intensive study of the distributed ISD experience in TECHCOM, an organization widely recognized for its excellence in IT development and use. The study reveals that agility should be viewed as a multifaceted concept having three dimensions: resource, process, and linkage. Resource agility is based on the distributed development team's access to necessary human and technological resources. Process agility pertains to the agility that originates in the team's systems development method guiding the project, its environmental scanning, and sense-making routines to anticipate possible crises, and its work practices enabling collaboration across time zones. Linkage agility arises from the nature of interactional relationships within the distributed team and with relevant project stakeholders, and is composed of cultural and communicative elements. The paper highlights some of the difficulties in developing agility in distributed ISD settings, provides actionable tactics, and suggests contingencies wherein different facets of agility may become more (or less) critical. © 2009 INFORMS.","Agility; Case study; Distributed information systems development; Global software development; Insourcing; Interpretive study; Offshoring; Virtual teamwork","Distributed computer systems; Information systems; Management information systems; Agility; Distributed information systems; Global software development; Insourcing; Interpretive study; Off-shoring; Virtual teamwork; Software design","","","","","","","Astley W.G., Zammuto R.F., Organization science, managers, and language games, Organ.

The idea has successfully been used by marketers to reach a large number of customers rapidly. If data about the customer network is available, centrality measures provide a structural measure that can be used in decision support systems to select influencers and spread viral marketing campaigns in a customer network. Usage stimulation and churn management are examples of DSS applications, where centrality of customers does play a role. The literature on network theory describes a large number of such centrality measures. A critical question is which of these measures is best to select an initial set of customers for a marketing campaign, in order to achieve a maximum dissemination of messages. In this paper, we present the results of computational experiments based on call data from a telecom company to compare different centrality measures for the diffusion of marketing messages. We found a significant lift when using central customers in message diffusion, but also found differences in the various centrality measures depending on the underlying network topology and diffusion process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the impact of BDA capabilities on a firm's performance is still not fully understood. These capabilities relate to the flexibility of the BDA infrastructure and the skills of the management and the firm's personnel. Most scholars explored the phenomenon from either a theoretical standpoint or neglected intermediate factors, such as organizational traits. This article builds on the dynamic capabilities view to propose and empirically test a model exploring whether organizational ambidexterity and agility mediate the relationship between BDA capabilities and organizational performance. Using data from surveys of 259 managers of large European organizations, we tested a proposed model using bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis. We found that organizational BDA capabilities affect a firm's ambidexterity and agility, which, in turn, affect its performance. These results establish ambidexterity and agility as positive mediators in the relationship between organizational BDA capabilities and a firm's performance. Furthermore, the organizational resistance to the implementation of information management systems and the fit between the organization and these systems also moderated this relationship. Practical implications for managers are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Agility; Ambidexterity; Big data; Big Data Analytics (BDA); Management information systems; Organizational performance","Europe; Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Human resource management; Management information systems; Managers; Agility; Ambidexterity; Dynamic capabilities; Information management systems; Mediation analysis; Organizational performance; bootstrapping; data set; empirical analysis; numerical model; organizational framework; performance assessment; Information management","","","","","","","Akter S., Wamba S.F., Gunasekaran A., Dubey R., Childe S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?, Int.

We agree that an understanding of cultural differences is important, but suggest that the concept of ""national culture"" that has tended to dominate the IS research literature is too simplistic. In this article, we challenge information systems researchers to go beyond models of national culture. We propose that IS researchers should adopt a more dynamic view of culture-one that sees culture as contested, temporal and emergent.","","Data communication systems; Decision support systems; Developing countries;

Despite claims on the part of vendors that the use of graphics will improve decision speed and quality over traditional methods of data display, the available evidence is far from supportive. Initial studies show graphics to be no more effective in communicating information than tables. Correct interpretation of graphical displays appears to require training, which most users lack. Furthermore, there is evidence that those features that make a graph visually attractive—such as color, design complexity, and realism—may actually detract from accurate comprehension. This paper summarizes the literature dealing with the human use of graphics, develops several propositions based on persistent trends in the literature, and suggests directions for future research.

We conduct a field study with an industrial supplier and examine the drivers of performance of the procurement process. Our research quantifies both the operational and strategic impacts of electronic integration in a B2B procurement environment for a supplier. Additionally, we show that the customer also obtains substantial benefits from efficient procurement transaction processing. We isolate the performance impact of technology choice and ordering processes on both the trading partners. A significant finding is that the supplier derives large strategic benefits when the customer initiates the system and the supplier enhances the system's capabilities. With respect to operational benefits, we find that when suppliers have advanced electronic linkages, the order-processing system significantly increases benefits to both parties.","B2B; Business Value of IT; Electronic Integration; Electronic Procurement; Empirical Assessment; Operational IT Impact; Strategic IT Impact","Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Industrial management; Information technology; Electronic integration; Management information systems","","","","","","","Amemiya T., Advanced Econometrics, (1985); Benjamin R., DeLong D., Scott-Morton M., The realities of electronic data interchange: How much competitive advantage?, Long Range Planning, 23, 1, pp. 29-40, (1990); Clemons E.K., Row M., MCkesson drug company, a case study of economost, J.

Adopting arguments from marketing, Van Dyke et al. (1997) question the SERVQUAL gap measurement approach, the interpretation and operationalization of the SERVQUAL expectation construct, and the reliability andvalidity of SERVQUAL dimensionality. In a response to those arguments, Pitt et al. (1997) defend their previous work (1995) in a point-by-point counterargument that suggests that the marginal empirical benefit of a perceptual-based (SERVPERF) service quality measure does not justify the loss of managerial diagnostic capabilities found in a gap measure. While siding with many of the positions taken by Pitt et al. (1997), we attempt to add value to the debate by presenting discrepancies we have with the two other research teams and by suggesting alternative approaches to resolve, or at least alleviate, problems associated with SERVQUAL We believe that the theoretical superiority of an alternative IS service quality measure should be backed by empirical evidence in the IS context, hence answering some of the criticism by Van Dyke et al. and offering a construct valid version of the IS-adapted SERVQUAL. From a pragmatic view-point, we believe that the justification of using SERVQUAL's gap measure should be driven by more effective ways to utilize expectations in IS service management. To this end, we introduce the newer Parasuraman et al. (1994b) measures, the concept of a ""zone of tolerance"" for expectation management and an illustration of its practical use in an IS setting. Overall, we attempt to set the direction of where we think this debate should lead the IS field, namely, toward practical and timely IS service quality measures.","Evaluation; Is management; Is service quality; Measurement; SERVPERF; SERVQUAL; User expectations","Evaluation; Knowledge representation; Marketing; Measurement theory; Quality assurance; Quality of service; Reliability; IS management; IS service quality; SERVPERF; SERVQUAL; User expectations; Management information systems","","","","","","","Andersen J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bagozzi R.P., Phillips L.W., Representing and Testing Organizational Theories: A Holistic Construal, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 459-489, (1982); Kettinger W.J., Lee C.C., Lee S., Global Measures of Information Service Quality: A Cross-National Study, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 569-588, (1995); Lee C.C., Kettinger W.J., A test of the psychometric properties of the IS adapted SERVQUAL measure, 1996 National INFORMS Meeting, (1996); Van Dyke T.P., Kappelman L.A., Prybutok V.R., Measuring information systems service quality: Concerns on the use of the SERVQUAL questionnaire, MIS Quarterly, 21, 2, pp. 195-208, (1997); Zeithaml V., Parasuraman A., Berry L.L., Delivering Quality Service: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations, (1990); Zeithaml V., Berry L.L., Parasuraman A., The nature and determinants of customer expectations of service quality, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 21, 1, pp. 1-12, (1993)","W.J.

A parallel research stream emphasizes voluntariness, a key social influence and contextual variable, as a critical factor in information technology (IT) adoption, but pays little attention to its role in TAM. This paper addresses this particular absence by investigating the impact of environment-based voluntariness on the relation-ships among the four primary TAM constructs. A metaanalysis of 71 empirical studies provides strong support for the hypotheses that environment-based voluntariness moderates the effects of ease of use and usefulness on behavioral intention, but not the effect of ease of use on usefulness. Moreover, inconsistent with our expectations, environment-based voluntariness does not moderate the effects of ease of use and usefulness on usage. By further analyzing the data set, we suggest this may be because of the relatively small sample size, the presence of other factors, or the inappropriate measurement of usage in previous studies. The current study contributes not only to the distinction between user-based and environment-based voluntariness but also to a more complete understanding of user acceptance of IT across system-use environments.","Acceptance; Behavioral intention; Ease of use; Meta-analysis; Publication bias; Statistical power analysis; Study artifacts; System usage; TAM; Usefulness; Voluntariness","Management information systems; Acceptance; Behavioral intention; Ease-of-use; Meta analysis; Publication bias; Statistical power; Study artifacts; System usages; Usefulness; Voluntariness; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Adams D.A., Nelson R.R., Todd P.A., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly, 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Agarwal R., Prasad J., The Role of Innovation Characteristics and Perceived Voluntariness in the Acceptance of Information Technologies, Decision Sciences, 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Agarwal R., Prasad J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new information technologies?, Decision Sciences, 30, 2, pp. 361-391, (1999); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Aladwani A.M., The development of two tools for measuring the easiness and usefulness of transactional web sites, European Journal of Information Systems, 11, 3, pp. 223-234, (2002); An J.Y., Correlates and Predictors of Consumers' Health Information and Services Usage Behavior on the Internet: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach, (2005); Argo J.J., Main K.J., Meta-analysis of the effectiveness of warning labels, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 23, 2, pp. 193-208, (2004); Bajaj A., Nidumolu S.R., A feedback model to understand information system usage, Information and Management, 33, 4, pp. 213-224, (1998); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Bostrom R.P., Olfman L., Sein M.K., The importance of learning style in end-user training, MIS Quarterly, 14, 1, pp. 101-119, (1990); Brown S.A., Massey A.P., Montoya-Weiss M.M., Burkman J.R., Do i really have to?

The main purpose of this paper is to raise awareness about the challenges of conducting field research on teams in global firms. Based on field research across multiple firms (software development, product development, financial services, and high technology), we outline five types of boundaries that we encountered in our field research (geographical, functional, temporal, identity, and organizational) and discuss methodological issues in distinguishing the effects of one boundary where multiple boundaries exist. We suggest that it is important to: (1) appropriately measure the boundary of interest to the study, (2) assess and control for other influential boundaries within and across teams, and (3) distinguish the effects of each boundary on each team outcome of interest. Only through careful attention to methodology can we properly assess the effects of team boundaries and appreciate their research and practical implications for designing and using information systems to support collaborative work.","Cross-functional teams; Distributed teams; Global teams; Interorganizational teams multiple boundaries; Organizational forms; Research methods; Virtual teams; Work groups","Product development; Research; Societies and institutions; Software engineering; Team boundaries; Management information systems","","","","","Lucent Technologies; National Science Foundation, NSF, (-9354995, -9812123, -9872996)","Acknowledgments: An earlier version of this paper was presented at the HaiiaInterwnational Conference on System Sciences, Big Island, Hawaii, Jauarny 7–10, 2002.

Various ISD outcomes are addressed using a classification scheme involving two broad categories - attitudinal/behavioral outcomes and productivity outcomes. The results demonstrate that user participation is minimally-to-moderately beneficial to ISD; its effects are comparatively stronger on attitudinal/behavioral outcomes than on productivity outcomes. This attitudinal/behavioral impact may largely be the result of the emphasis that has been placed on user participation by academics and consultants. The results of this analysis are compared to those of a meta-analysis in the broader management context of participation. The results are similar in terms of attitudinal outcomes, but different, and lesser, in terms of productivity outcomes. Since the current status of research in the broad area of participation is that the effects of participation are considered to be problematic, that status and the results of this study suggest that user participation alone may not be sufficient to achieve significantly improved ISD outcomes, and that different strategies should be employed based on the specific goals of ISD projects. If system acceptance is the ultimate goal, user participation should be designed to induce more psychological involvement among potential users. If productivity benefits are the focus, user participation should be designed to provide developers the needed domain knowledge. In sum, user participation should be treated as one of a number of means for ISD projects to be more successful. © 2008 M.E.

This paper presents a qualitative study of role changes that occur when faculty become online or virtual professors. In 20 semi-structured interviews of faculty, coded with pattern analysis software, the authors captured role changes enacted by instructors in ALN settings-cognitive roles, affective roles, and managerial roles. The cognitive role, which relates to mental processes of learning, information storage, and thinking, shifts to one of deeper cognitive complexity. The affective role, which relates to influencing the relationships between students, the instructor, and the classroom atmosphere, required faculty to find new tools to express emotion, yet they found the relationship with students more intimate. The managerial role, which deals with class and course management, requires greater attention to detail, more structure, and additional student monitoring. Overall, faculty reported a change in their teaching persona, toward more precision in their presentation of materials and instructions, combined with a shift to a more Socratic pedagogy, emphasizing multilogues with students. The main sources of frustration and of fulfillment of the virtual professor are explored.","Affective role; Asynchronous learning networks; Cognitive role; E-learning; Managerial roles; Role theory","Cognitive systems; Education; Internet; Students; Asynchronous learning networks (ALN); Management information systems","","","","","New Jersey Center for Multi-Media Research","Acknowledgments: This research was partially supported by the Alfred P.S anlFouondation, and by the New Jersey Center for Multi-Media Research.

H3A 1G5, 1001 Sherbrooke West, Canada","This study compares two conceptual (resource-centered and contingency-based) and two analytical (linear and nonlinear) approaches that can be used to assess the strategic value of information technology. Two hypotheses related to these approaches are developed and tested based on matched survey data collected from the CEOs and CIOs of 110 firms. The results indicate that the resource-centered and contingency-based approaches provide complementary understanding of the strategic value of IT. On the one hand, the contingency-based approach is better at explaining the impact of costrelated IT applications on firm performance. Alignment between business strategy and information systems strategy on cost reduction was found to have a significant negative association with firm expense. On the other hand, the resource-centered perspective has a stronger predictive ability of IT impact on firm revenue and profitability. Our results indicate that investments in growth-oriented applications were directly and positively related to firm revenue. An ANOVA test indicates that the nonlinear approaches provide additional insights that help to better understand the relationship between alignment and performance. The response surface method (RSM) shows that high-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both high) leads to superior performance compared to low-end strategic alignment (i.e., fit occurring when business strategy and IT strategy are both low). We discuss the implications of this study for research and practice and conclude with suggestions for future research directions.","Alignment of IT; Business value of IT; Contingency approach; Nonlinear approaches; Organizational performance; Resource-centered view; Strategic; Strategic value of IT","Linear systems; Management information systems; Nonlinear analysis; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Contingency approach; Nonlinear approaches; Organizational performance; Strategic value; Information technology","","","","","","","Ahuja M., Carley K., Network Structure in Virtual Organizations, Organization Science, 10, 6, pp. 741-757, (1999); Alexander J., Randolph W., The Fit Between Technology and Structure as a Predictor of Performance in Nursing Subunits, Academy of Management Journal, 28, 4, pp. 844-859, (1985); Anderson P., Meyer A., Eisenhardt K., Carley K., Pettigrew A., Introduction to the Special Issue: Applications of Complexity Theory to Organization Science, Organization Science, 10, 2, pp. 233-236, (1999); Altman D.G., Practical Statistics for Medical Research, (1991); Bakos Y., Treacy E., Information Technology and Corporate Strategy: A research Perspective, MIS Quarterly, 10, 2, pp. 107-119, (1986); Barney J., Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barua A., Kriebel C., Mukhopadhyay T., Information Technologies and Business Value: An Analytic and Empirical Investigation, Information Systems Research, 6, 1, pp. 3-23, (1995); Barua A., Prabhudev K., Whinston A., Yin F., An Empirical Investigation of Net-Enabled Business Value, MIS Quarterly, 28, 4, pp. 585-620, (2004); Bergeron F., Raymond L., Rivard S., Fit in Strategic Information Technology Management Research: An Empirical Comparison of Perspectives, Omega, 29, 2, pp. 125-142, (2001); Bharadwaj A., A Resource-Based Perspective on Information Technology Capability and Firm Performance: An Empirical Investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bharadwaj A., Bharadwaj S., Konsynski B., Information Technology Effects as Measured by Tobin's q, Management Science, 45, 6, pp. 1008-1024, (1999); Box G., Draper N., Empirical Model-Building and Response Surface, (1987); Brynjolfsson E., The Productivity Paradox of Information Technology, Communications of ACM, 36, 12, pp. 66-77, (1993); Brynjolfsson E., Hitt L., Paradox Lost?

This paper presents the results of a study of the outsourcing behavior of ten large organizations. The analysis used the transaction cost framework to explain outsourcing behavior at two different levels. At the first level of analysis, the role of asset specificity, measurement problem, and frequency in explaining the choice of the outsourced activities is investigated. The second level of analysis focuses on the influence of asset specificity and measurement problem on the terms and on the management of the contract between a firm and its outsourcer. The results presented here support the basic principles of transaction cost and incomplete contract theories.","Asset specificity; Case study; Contract management; Frequency; IS operations; Measurement problem;

An instrument for measurement of end user computing satisfaction (EUCS) is developed. Using exploratory factor analysis, six attitudinal dimensions for measurement of EUCS are first identified. Structural equation modelling techniques are then used to explore the relationship between EUCS and user performance. It is shown that the six attitudinal dimensions of EUCS account for a significant portion of the variation in user performance.","Computing performance; End user computing; Measures of satisfaction; Satisfaction; Structural equation modelling","Human computer interaction; Mathematical models; Performance; User interfaces; Computing satisfaction; End user computing; Exploratory factor analysis; Structural equation modelling; Management information systems","","","","","Social Science and Humanity Research Council of Canada","This research is supported by a grant from Social Science and Humanity Research Council of Canada.","Amoroso D., Cheney P., Testing a causal model of end-user application effectiveness, Journal of Management Information Systems, pp. 39-48, (1991); Amoroso D., Cheney P., Quality end user developed applications: Some essential ingredients, Data Base, pp. 1-12, (1992); Bailey J., Pearson S., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, Management Science, 29, 5, pp. 530-545, (1983); Bollen K.A., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Baroudi J.J., Orlikowski W.J., A short form measure of user information satisfaction: Research and practice, Journal of Management Information Systems, (1986); Bentler P.M., Bonett D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606, (1980); Cattel R.B., The Scientific Use of Factor Analysis, (1978); Delone W.H., McLean E.R., Information systems success: The quest for the dependent variable, Information Systems Research, pp. 60-95, (1992); Doll W.J., Torkzadeh G., The measurement of end-user computing satisfaction, MIS Quarterly, pp. 259-274, (1988); Doll W.J., Torkzadeh G., The measurement of end-user computing satisfaction: Theoretical and methodological issues, MIS Quarterly, pp. 5-10, (1991); Etezadi-Amoli J., Farhoomand A.F., On end-user computing satisfaction, MIS Quarterly, pp. 1-4, (1991); Fornell C., Issues in the application of covariance structure analysis: A comment, Journal of Consumer Research, 9, 3, pp. 443-448, (1983); Galletta D.F., Lederer A.L., Some cautions on the measurement of user information satisfaction, Decision Sciences, 20, pp. 419-438, (1989); Goodhue D., IS attitude: Towards theoretical definition and measurement clarity, Database, pp. 6-15, (1988); Hayduk L.A., Structural Equation Modelling with LISREL, (1987); Ives B., Olson M., Baroudi J.J., The measurement of user information satisfaction, Communications of the ACM, pp. 785-793, (1983); Joreskog K.G., Sorbom D., SPSS LISREL 7 and PRELIS User's Guide and Reference, (1990); Kaiser H.F., The varimax criterion for analytic rotation in factor analysis, Psychometrika, 23, pp. 187-200, (1970); Lord F.M., Novick M.R., Statistical Theory of Mental Test Score, (1974); Mason R., Swanson B., Measurement for management decisions: A perspective, California Management Review, pp. 70-81, (1979); Melone N.P., A theoretical assessment of the user-satisfaction construct in information-systems research, Management Science, pp. 76-91, (1990); Miller J., Information systems effectiveness: The fit between business needs and system capabilities, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 273-288, (1989); Rice R.E., Contractor N.S., Conceptualization effects of office information systems: A methodology and application for the study of alpha, beta, and gamma changes, Decision Sciences, 21, pp. 301-317, (1990); Rosenblueth A., Wiener N., Bigelow J., Behaviour, purpose, and teleology, Philosophy of Science, 10, pp. 18-24, (1943); Schewe C., The management information system user: An exploratory behavioral analysis, Academy of Management Journal, pp. 577-590, (1976); Swanson B., Management information systems: Appreciation and involvement, Management Science, 21, pp. 178-188, (1974); Treacy M., An empirical examination of a causal model of user information satisfaction, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 285-297, (1985)","J.

We propose that perceived threat to professional autonomy is a salient outcome belief affecting physician acceptance of an IT. In addition, level of knowledge codification of an IT is an important technological context affecting physician acceptance. Data from a sample of U.S. physicians were collected to test the hypotheses using partial least squares analysis. Results show that perceived threat to professional autonomy has a significant, negative direct influence on perceived usefulness of an IT and on intention to use that IT. Level of knowledge codification is also an important variable. The effect of perceived threat to professional autonomy is larger for clinical decision support systems than for electronic medical records systems. Awareness of these results would help managers better manage IT implementation in health care settings. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Problems arising from low commitment have also been described. However, there has been little research on the factors that influence the level of commitment to an IS project. This paper provides some initial insights into the determinants of commitment based on a longitudinal study of an IS project that was stopped and then restarted on several occasions over a 17-year period (1975-1992). The paper draws four types of determinants - project, psychological, social, and structural - from the organization behavior literature and uses them to explain six decisions that were made during the 17-year period. A comparison of these six decisions suggests that project determinants play a central role during the initial commitment decision, but the other determinants assume greater importance in later stages. Moreover, it seems that in this case study, project and psychological determinants affected the decision to increase commitment, whereas social and structural determinants influenced the decision to withdraw commitment to the project. Some implications for practice and future research are examined.","Commitment; Conflict; Project management; Systems development","Decision making; Problem solving; Project management; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Systems analysis; Commitment; Conflict; Systems development; Management information systems","","","","","","","Bargh J.A., Attention and automaticity in the processing of self-relevant information, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43, 3, pp. 425-436, (1982); Barki H., Rivard S., Talbot J., Toward an assessment of software development risk, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 2, pp. 203-225, (1993)","M.

As critical antecedents of dependence and trust among team members, four constructs are included in the study-environmental complexity, domain expertise, similarity of project value, and communication frequency. Partial least square analyses are conducted, using data collected from 135 project teams in two large IT firms. The results confirm that dependence and trust maintain a strong impact on knowledge sharing, leading to good team project performance. This study uses a cross-sectional survey as a research method. Longer term exploration seems necessary to further explore how trust and dependence are actually formed among team members. Findings indicate that team members share their knowledge when they trust their partners and when they feel dependent. Feelings of dependence and trust are influenced by the communication frequency, perceived similarity of the project's value, and the perceived expertise. Project managers need to pay attention to these variables in order to increase the level of knowledge sharing among team members especially in information systems development projects where primary tasks are critically knowledge-intensive. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.","Dependence;

Our overall objective in this study is to better understand the diversity in IS research, and the extent to which diversity is universal across journals that publish IS research. We developed a classification system that comprises five key characteristics of diversity (reference discipline, level of analysis, topic, research approach, and research method) based on a review of prior literature. We then examined articles over a five-year period, from 1995 to 1999, in five journals acknowledged as the top journals of the field, at least in North America. Analyses reveal considerable diversity in each of the key characteristics. Perhaps not surprisingly, the research approach used is more focused with most studies being conducted using hypothetico-deductive approaches, whereas reference discipline is perhaps the most diverse of the characteristics examined. An interesting finding is that IS itself emerged as a key reference discipline in the late 1990s. The Journal of Management Information Systems and Information Systems Research publish articles displaying the greatest diversity, and MIS Quarterly and Decision Sciences publish articles that focus on subsets of the field. Our research provides a foundation for addressing the direction that diversity in the IS discipline takes over time. In the shorter term, researchers can use our classification system as a guide to writing abstracts and selecting key words, and the findings of our journal analyses to determine the best outlet for their type of research.","Information systems journals; Information systems research; Information systems research diversity; Level of analysis; Reference discipline; Research methods","Classification (of information); Computer simulation; Decision making; Information technology; Information systems journals; Management information systems","","","","","","","ACM Computing classification system, (1998); Ajzen I., From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior, Action Control: From Cognition to Behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Alavi M., Carlson P.A., Review of MIS research and disciplinary development: Implications for deans/administrators, Journal of Management Information Systems, 8, 4, pp. 45-62, (1992); Alavi M., Carlson P., Brooke G., The ecology of MIS research: A twenty year status review, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 363-375, (1989); Alter S., Ein-Dor P., Markus M.L., Scott J.E., Vessey I., Does the trend toward ebusiness call for changes in the fundamental concepts of information systems?

Such problems are characterized by a large degree of uncertainty with respect to how the problem should be approached and how to establish and evaluate the set of alternative solutions. A design theory nexus is a set of constructs and methods that enable the construction of models that connect numerous design theories with alternative solutions. It thereby offers a unique problem-solving approach that is particularly useful for addressing ill-structured or wicked problems. For each alternative solution in a design theory nexus one or more unique criteria are established to formulate a specific design theory. We develop a general method for constructing a design theory nexus and illustrate its utility using two field studies. One develops and applies an organizational change nexus. The other develops and applies a user involvement nexus. Each is a specific instantiation of the general design theory nexus constructs. Using these illustrations, we provide examples of how to evaluate such instantiations. We then discuss our findings as well as the validity of our approach. We conclude that the design theory nexus provides a viable conceptualization that enables the construction of effective problem-solving artifacts.","Design research; Design science research; Multiple criteria decision making; Organizational change; Participative development; Science of design; User involvement; Wicked problems","Management information systems; Design research; Design-science researches; Multiple criteria decision making; Organizational change; Participative development; Science of design; User involvement; Wicked problems; Decision making","","","","","","","Agerfalk P.J., Goldkuhl G., Fitzgerald B., Bannon L., Reflecting on Action in Language, Organisations and Information Systems, European Journal of Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 4-8, (2006); Andersen C.V., Krath F., Krakow L., Mathiassen L., Pries-Heje J., The Grass Root Effort, Improving Software Organizations - From Principles to Practice, pp. 83-98, (2001); Applegate L., McFarlan F.W., McKenney J.L., Corporate Information Systems Management: Text and Cases, (1999); Barki H., Hartwick J., Rethinking the Concept of User Involvement, MIS Quarterly, 13, 1, pp. 55-63, (1989); Barki H., Hartwick J., Rethinking the Concept of User Involvement, and User Attitude, MIS Quarterly, 18, 1, pp. 59-79, (1994); Barley S.R., The Alignment of Technology and Structure through Roles and Networks, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 1, pp. 61-103, (1990); Baroudi J.J., Olson M.H., Ives B., An Empirical Study of the Impact of User Involvement on System Usage and Information Satisfaction, Communications of the ACM, 29, 3, pp. 232-238, (1986); Bashein B.J., Markus M.L., Riley P., Preconditions for BPR Success: And How to Prevent Failures, Information Systems Management, 11, 2, pp. 7-13, (1994); Baskerville R., Stage J., Accommodating Emergent Work Practices: Ethnographic Choice of Method Fragments, Realigning Research and Practice in Is Development: The Social and Organizational Perspective, pp. 12-28, (2001); Baumoel U., Strategic Agility through Situational Method Construction,,  Annual Conference on Responsible Management in an Uncertain World, (2005); Beer M., Nohria N., Breaking the Code of Change, (2000); Belton V., Stewart T.J., Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis - An Integrated Approach, (2001); Benner M., Tushman M., Exploitation, Exploration, and Process Management: The Productivity Dilemma Revisited, Academy ofManagement Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Bodker K., Simonsen J., Kensing F., Participatory IT Design: Designing for Business and Workplace Realities, (2004); Store Statslige IT-Projekter - Hvordan Gør Man Det Bedre?

In this paper, we continue this exploration by focusing specifically on entanglement: the inseparability of meaning and matter. Our particular approach is differentiated by its grounding in a relational and performative ontology, and its use of agential realism. We explore some of the key ideas of entanglement through a comparison of two phenomena in the travel sector: an institutionalized accreditation scheme offered by the AA and an online social media website hosted by TripAdvisor. Our analysis centers on the production of anonymity in these two practices of hotel evaluation. By examining how anonymity is constituted through an entanglement of matter and meaning, we challenge the predominantly social treatments of anonymity to date and draw attention to the uncertainties and outcomes generated by specific performances of anonymity in practice. In closing, we consider what the particular agential realist concept of entanglement entails for understanding anonymity, and discuss its implications for research practice.","Agential realism; Anonymity;

Evaluation of system effectiveness is difficult due to its multidimensionality its quantitative and qualitative aspects, and the multiple, and often conflicting, evaluator viewpoints. This article provides an overview of what system effectiveness means and how it should be measured. It is the first of two articles to appear in consecutive issues of the MIS. Quarterly. Starting with a definition of system effectiveness, this article examines evaluation of system effectiveness in terms of a conceptual hierarchy of system objectives. The hierarchy is used to discuss problems in, and recommendations for, evaluating system effectiveness, and to compare MIS evaluation approaches. The second article characterizes and compares the evaluator viewpoints on system effectiveness for decision makers in several functional groups involved in MIS implementation - user, MIS, internal audit, and management. The second article recommends several MIS evaluation approaches for incorporating multiple dimensions and multiple evaluator viewpoints into evaluations of information system effectiveness.","Evaluation; Management information systems; MIS","","","","","","","","Alter S.L., A Study of Computers Aided Decision Making in Organizations, (1975); Anderson J.C., Schroeder R.G., Tupy S.E., White E.M., MRP: A Study of Implementation and Practice, (1981); Appleton D., A Manufacturing Systems Cookbook: Part 2, Datamation, 25, 3, pp. 132-140, (1979); Campbell J.P., On the Nature of Organization Effectiveness, New Perspectives on Organizational Effectiveness, pp. 13-55, (1977); Carlson E.O., Evaluating the Impact of Information Systems, Management Informatics, 3, pp. 57-67, (1974); Cheney H., Measuring MIS Project Success, Proceedings of 9th Annual AIDS Conference, pp. 141-143, (1977); Dickson G.W., Powers R.F., MIS Project Management: Myths, Opinions, and Reality, California Management Review, 7, pp. 147-156, (1973); Dolotto T.A., Bernstein M.I., Dickson Jr. R.S., France N.A., Rosenblatt B.A., Smith D.M., Steel Jr. T.B., Data Processing in 1980-1985, (1976); Ein-dor P., Segev E., Strategic Planning for Management Information Systems, Management Science, 24, 15, pp. 1631-1641, (1978); Gallagher C.A., Perceptions of the Value of a Management Science Implementation, Academy of Management Journal, 17, 1, pp. 46-55, (1974); Ginzberg M.J., Improving MIS Project Selection, (1978); Greenberg H.D., Stewart R.J.S., Hanes L.F., Kriebel C.H., Debons A., Productivity Measurement Systems for Administrative Services: Computing and Information Services, Proceedings of the Grantee's Conference on Research on Productivity Measurement Systems for Administrative Services, (1976); Halbrecht H.Z., MIS Quarterly, 1, 2, pp. 7-11, (1977); Hamilton S., A Survey of Data Processing Post Installation Evaluation Practices, (1980); Keen P.G.W., Scott Morton M.S., Decision Support Systems: An Organizational Perspective, (1978); Kriebel C.H., Raviv A., Zia H., An Economics Approach to Modeling the Productivity of Information Systems, (1977); Langefores B., Discussion of 'Determining Management Information Needs: A Comparison of Methods, MIS Quarterly, 1, 4, (1977); Lientz B.P., Swanson E.B., Tompkins G.E., Characteristics of Application Software Maintenance, Communications of the ACM, 21, 6, pp. 466-471, (1978); Lucas Jr. H.C., Performance and Use of an Information System, Management Science, 21, 4, pp. 908-919, (1975); McLean E.R., Soden J., Strategic Planning for MIS, (1977); Meals D.W., Systems Evaluation, Journal of Systems Management, 16, 7, pp. 6-9, (1977); Molnar J.J., Rogers D.L., Organizational Effectiveness: An Empirical Comparison of the Goal and System Resource Approaches, The Sociological Quarterly, 17, 2, pp. 401-413, (1976); Norton D.P., Rau K.G., A Guide to EDP Performance Management, QED Information Sciences, (1978); O'Brien J.F., Methodology for Assessing the Impact of Computing and Information Systems on Users, (1977); Pearson S.W., Measurement of Computer User Satisfaction, (1977); Price J.L., The Study of Organizational Effectiveness, The Sociological Quarterly, 13, 4, pp. 3-15, (1972); Richardson P.R., Gordon J.R.M., Measuring Total Manufacturing Performance, Sloan Management Review, 9, 2, pp. 47-58, (1980); Schriven M., The Methodology of Evaluation: Formative and Summative Evaluation, Evaluating Action Programs, (1972); Seashore S.E., Yuchtman E., Factor Analysis of Organizational Performance, Administrative Science Quarterly, 12, 2, pp. 377-395, (1967); Seward H.H., Evaluating Information Systems, The Information Systems Handbook, pp. 132-153, (1975); Smith Jr. G.L., Participatory Approaches to the Development of Productivity Measures, Proceedings of the 9th Annual SMIS Conference, pp. 101-110, (1977); Stabell C.B., Individual Differences in Management Decision Making Processes: A Study of Conversational Computer Usage, (1974); Varanelli A., An Organizational Approach to the Evaluation of Computing Center Effectiveness, (1978)","","","Management Information Systems Research Center","","","","","","02767783","","MISQD","","English","MIS Quart Manage Inf Syst","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0009193192"

Marketing, strategy, and graphic design professionals have joined technical developers, business managers, and users in the development of Web-based applications. Often, these specialists work for different organizations with distinct histories and cultures. A longitudinal, qualitative field study of a Web-based application development project was undertaken to develop an in-depth understanding of the collaborative practices that unfold among diverse professionals on ISD projects. The paper proposes that multiparty collaborative practice can be understood as constituting a ""collective reflection-in-action"" cycle through which an information systems (IS) design emerges as a result of agents producing, sharing, and reflecting on explicit objects. Depending on their control over the various economic and cultural (intellectual) resources brought to the project and developed on the project, agents influence the design in distinctive ways. They use this control to either ""add to,"" ""ignore,"" or ""challenge"" the work produced by others. Which of these modes of collective reflection-in-action are enacted on the project influences whose expertise will be reflected in the final design. Implications for the study of boundary objects, multiparty collaboration, and organizational learning in contemporary ISD are drawn. © 2005 INFORMS.","Critical perspectives on IT; Ethnographic research; Interpretive research; Management of IS projects; Outsourcing; System design and implementation","Management information systems; Outsourcing; Web crawler; Web services; Websites; Collaborative practices; Critical perspectives; Design and implementations; Information systems development; Information systems development projects; Interpretive research; Multiparty collaborations; Qualitative field studies; Information systems","","","","","","","Agar M., The Professional Stranger: An Informal Introduction to Ethnography, (1980); Andersen N.E., Professional Systems Development: Experience, Ideas, and Action, (1990); Austin R., The effects of time pressure on quality in software development: An agency model, Inform.

This study examines some of the important organizational impacts of the fashion phenomenon in IT. An IT fashion is a transitory collective belief that an information technology is new, efficient, and at the forefront of practice. Using data collected from published discourse and annual IT budgets of 109 large companies for a decade, I have found that firms whose names were associated with IT fashions in the press did not have higher performance, but they had better reputation and higher executive compensation in the near term. Companies investing in IT in fashion also had higher reputation and executive pay, but they had lower performance in the short term and then improved performance in the long term. These results support a fashion explanation for the middle phase diffusion of IT innovations, illustrating that following fashion can legitimize organizations and their leaders regardless of performance improvement. The findings also extend institutional theory from its usual focus on taken-for-granted practices to fashion as a novel source of social approval. This study suggests that practitioners balance between performance pressure and social approval when they confront whatever is hottest in IT.","Corporate reputation; Diffusion; Discourse; Executive compensation; Information technology fashion; Innovation; Legitimacy; Management fashion; Performance","Diffusion; Management information systems; Corporate reputations; Discourse; Executive compensation; Information technology fashions; Legitimacy; Performance; Budget control","","","","","","","Abrahamson E., Managerial Fads and Fashions: The Diffusion and Rejection of Innovations, Academy of Management Review, 16, 3, pp. 586-612, (1991); Abrahamson E., Management Fashion, Academy of Management Review, 21, 1, pp. 254-285, (1996); Abrahamson E., Fairchild G., Management Fashion: Lifecycles, Triggers, and Collective Learning Processes, Administrative Science Quarterly, 44, 4, pp. 708-740, (1999); Aldrich H.E., Fiol C.M., Fools Rush In?

Drawing on Time, Interaction, and Performance (TIP) theory, we consider how and why virtual team behavior is temporally patterned in complex ways. We report on the results of an experiment consisting of 35 virtual project teams comprised of 175 members residing in the United States and Japan. Through content and cluster analysis, we identify distinct patterns of interaction and examine how these patterns are associated with differential levels of GVPT performance. We also explore the role of temporal coordination mechanisms as a means to synchronize temporal patterns in GVPTs. Our results suggest that successful enactment of temporal coordination mechanisms is associated with higher performance. However, we found that temporal coordination per se is not the driver of performance; rather, it is the influence of coordination on interaction behaviors that affects performance.","Cluster analysis; Computer-mediated communication; Temporal coordination; Virtual teams","Decision making; Human computer interaction; Project management; Virtual reality; Virtual project teams; Management information systems","","","","","","","Ancona D.G., Caldwell D.F., Bridging the boundary: External activity and performance in organizational teams, Administrative Sciences Quarterly, 37, 4, pp. 634-665, (1992); Ancona D.G., Caldwell D.F., Demography and design: Predictors of new product performance, Organization Science, 3, 3, pp. 321-341, (1992); Beale E.M.L., Cluster Analysis, (1969); Bordia P., Face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication: A synthesis of the experimental literature, Journal of Business Communication, 34, 1, pp. 99-120, (1997); Boudreau M., Loch K., Robey D., Straub D., Going global: Using IT to advance the competitiveness of the virtual transnational organization, Academy of Management Executive, 12, 4, pp. 120-128, (1998); Boyd H., Walker O., Larreche J.C., Marketing Management, (1998); Briggs R.O., Nunamaker J.F.

After the first measurement, IS management initiated several actions to improve service quality. The second measurement indicated that service quality improved in the intervening period. When service quality was measured a third time, it had returned to the levels of the first measurement. The evidence suggests that management's attention to service quality waned after about a year, and IS management needs to recognize that service quality is not a fad but an ongoing commitment. The paper concludes by recognizing that delivering IS service quality requires action at three levels (strategic, tactical, and operational) and that the CIO must pay continuing attention to IS service quality. A model for building service quality into IS is described.","IS management; Longitudinal study; Service quality; SERVQUAL","Benchmarking; Customer satisfaction; Information technology; Mathematical models; Personal computers; Productivity; Quality of service; Societies and institutions; Software engineering; IS management; Longitudinal study; Service quality; SERVQUAL; Management information systems","","","","","","","Beath C.M., Supporting the information technology champion, MIS Quarterly, 15, 3, pp. 355-372, (1991); Kettinger W.J., Lee C.C., Lee S., Global measures of information service quality: A cross-national study, Decision Sciences, 26, 5, pp. 569-588, (1995); Lewin K., Frontiers in group dynamics, Human Relations, 1, pp. 5-41, (1947); Mayo E., The Human Problems of an Industrial Civilization, (1953)","R.T.

Reliable measurement of UIS is important for providing evaluative information for both researchers and practitioners. This study used 92 managers and executives as subjects to compare the test/retest reliability of a widely used, 13‐scale UIS instrument together with four summary questions under experimental and control conditions. The summary questions behaved more reliably than the detailed questions for all groups, perhaps because of problems with scale units and origins and with item heterogeneity. This suggests that researchers need more reliable measures of UIS and that practitioners need to exercise caution when collecting and interpreting UIS scores. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

In the information and communication technology (ICT) context, a growing number of studies consider the affective dimension of human interaction with ICTs. However, few of these studies take systematic approaches, resulting in inconsistent conclusions and contradictory advice for researchers and practitioners. Many of these issues stem from ambiguous conceptualizations of various affective concepts and their relationships. Before researchers can address questions such as ""what causes affective responses in an ICT context"" and ""what impacts do affective responses have on human interaction with ICTs,"" a theoretical foundation for affective concepts and their relationships has to be established. This theory and review paper addresses three research questions: (1) What are pertinent affective concepts in the ICT context? (2) In what ways are these affective concepts similar to, or different from each other? (3) How do these affective concepts relate to or influence one another? Based on theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, the affective response model (ARM) is developed. ARM is a theoretically bound conceptual framework that provides a systematic and holistic reference map for any ICT study that considers affect. It includes a taxonomy that classifies affective concepts along five dimensions: the residing, the temporal, the particular/general stimulus, the object/behavior stimulus, and the process/outcome dimensions. ARM also provides a nomological network to indicate the causal or co-occurring relationships among the various types of affective concepts in an ICT interaction episode. ARM has the power for explaining and predicting, as well as prescribing, potential future research directions.

In this paper, we discuss the practical advantages of such techniques for the selection of a software platform. First, we argue that traditional quantitative approaches to a cost-benefit analysis give only a partial picture of such decision situations: due to the long planning horizon required because of the time-consuming and resource-intensive implementation process, it is not possible to exactly predict which applications will, in fact, run on the system over time. Thus, the investor is faced with the problem of valuing ""implementation opportunities."" We then compare different valuation techniques for this task and discuss their respective advantages and draw-backs. The practical advantages of employing such models are demonstrated by describing a real-life case study where option pricing models were used for deciding whether to continue employing SAP R/2 or to switch to SAP R/3.","Cost-benefit analysis; IS investment; Real options; SAP R/3; Software platform; Strategic IS management","Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Information technology; Investments; IS investment; Real options; SAP R/3; Software platform; Strategic IS management; Management information systems","","","","","","","Amram M., Kulatilaka N., Henderson J., Taking an option on it, CIO, 12, 17, pp. 46-52, (1999); Benaroch M., Kauffman R.J., A case for using option pricing analysis to evaluate information technology project investments, Information Systems Research, 10, 10, pp. 70-86, (1999); Kambil A., Henderson J., Mohsenzadeh H., Strategic management of information technology investments: An option perspective, Strategic Information Technology Management: Perspectives on Organizational Growth and Competitive Advantage, pp. 161-178, (1993)","A.

Using a sample of 118 usermanagers in 34 companies, the results show that user involvement in design and implementation is related positively to users' perceptions of system usefulness. However, organizational factors were not found to be related significantly to user involvement, as had been originally hypothesized. Rather, organizational factors either had a direct relationship with perceived usefulness or moderated the relationship between involvement and usefulness. Two factors reflecting an MIS department's maturity (size and age) were found to reduce users' perceptions of system usefulness. Also, users at higher levels and those making more structured decisions found their systems more useful, although the user's level was found to moderate perceptions of system usefulness during the design stage. Three other organizational factors (level of MIS manager, MIS department scope, and decentralization of authority) also were found to have moderating effects. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

We tested one of its assumptions that the 'perceived ease-of-use' and 'perceived usefulness' constructs fully mediate the influence of external variables on usage behaviors. Using a survey of 125 employees of a U.S. Government agency we found, contrary to the normally accepted assumption, that external variables could have direct effects on usage behavior over and above their indirect effects. We also found that TAM is significantly and consistently better at predicting frequency than volume of usage. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While significant debate has surrounded ride-sharing, limited empirical work has been devoted to uncovering the societal benefits of such services (or the mechanisms which drive these benefits). Using a difference in difference approach to exploit a natural experiment, the entry of Uber Black and Uber X into California markets between 2009 and 2014, we find a significant drop in the rate of fatalities after the introduction of Uber X. Further, results suggest that not all services have the same effect, insofar as the effect of the Uber Black car service is intermittent and manifests only in selective locations (i.e., large cities). These results underscore the importance of coupling increased availability with cost savings in order to exploit the public welfare gains offered by the sharing economy. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","Difference in difference; Drunk driving; Natural experiment; Platforms; Ride-sharing; Sharing economy; Uber; Vehicular fatalities","Management information systems; Difference-in-differences; Drunk driving; Natural experiment; Platforms; Ride-sharing; Sharing economy; Uber; Vehicular fatalities; Automobile drivers","","","","","","","Alter S., Viewing systems as services: A fresh approach in the is field, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 26, 11, pp. 195-224, (2010); Angrist J.D., Pischke J.-S., Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion, (2008); Assaad J.-M., Exum M.L., Understanding intoxicated violence from a rational choice perspective, Rational Choice and Criminal Behavior: Recent Research and Future Challenges, pp. 65-84, (2002); Azoulay P., Zivin J.S.G., Wang J., Superstar extinction, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 125, 2, pp. 549-589, (2010); Badger E., Are uber and lyft responsible for reducing duis?, Washington Post, (2014); Bakos Y., Bailey J., An exploratory study of the emerging role of electronic intermediaries, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 1, 3, pp. 7-20, (1997); Bapna R., Ramaprasad J., Shmueli G., Umyarov A., One-way mirrors in online dating: A randomized field experiment, The Workshop on Information Systems Economics, (2012); Bertrand M., Duflo E., Mullainathan S., How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 1, pp. 249-275, (2004); Birkland T.A., Lawrence R.G., Media framing and policy change after columbine, American Behavioral Scientist, 52, pp. 1426-1446, (2009); Blackwell M., Iacus S.M., King G., Porro G., Cem: Coarsened exact matching in stata, Stata Journal, 9, 4, pp. 524-546, (2009); Brynjolfsson E., Hu Y., Smith M.D., Consumer surplus in the digital economy: Estimating the value of increased product variety at online booksellers, Management Science, 49, 11, pp. 1580-1596, (2003); Brynjolfsson E., Smith M.D., Frictionless commerce?

Enacting such epistemic scripts squeezes IS theory to the middle range, where abstract reference theory concepts are directly instantiated or slightly modified to the IS context, whereas IT remains exogenous to theory by being treated as an independent variable, mediator, or moderator. In this design, IT is often operationalized using proxies that detect the presence of IT or its variation in use or cost. Our analysis of 143 articles published in MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the past 15 years demonstrates that over 70 percent of published theory conforms to this mode of producing IS knowledge. This state of play has resulted in two negative consequences: the field (1) agonizes over the dearth of original and bold theorizing over IT and (2) satisfices when integrating theory with empirics by creating incommensurate mid-range models that are difficult to consolidate. We propose that one way to overcome these challenges is to critically examine and debate the negative impacts of the field's dominant epistemic scripts and relax them by permitting IS scholarship that more fluidly accommodates alternative forms of knowledge production. This will push IS inquiry to the ""edges"" and emphasize, on the one hand, inductive, rich inquiries using innovative and extensive data sets and, on the other hand, novel, genuine, high-level theorizing around germane conceptual relationships between IT, information and its (semiotic) representations, and social behaviors. We offer several exemplars of such inquiries and their results. To promote this push, we invite alternative institutionalized forms of publishing and reviewing. We conclude by inviting individual scholars to be more open to practices that permit richer theorizing. These recommendations will broaden the field's knowledge ecology and permit the creation of good IS knowledge over just getting ""hits."" We surmise that, if such changes are carried out, the field can look confidently toward its future as one of the epicenters of organizational inquiry that deal with the central forces shaping human enterprise in the 21st century. © 2015 The Authors.","Epistemic scripts;

These five approaches are selected for analysis because they illustrate alternative philosophical assumptions from the dominant ""orthodoxy"" identified in the research literature. The paper also proposes a distinction between ""approach"" and ""methodology."" The analysis of the five approaches is organized around four basic ques-tions: What is the assumed nature of an information system (ontology)? What is human knowledge and how can it be obtained (epistemology)? What are the preferred research methods for continuing the improvement of each approach (research methodology)? and what are the implied values of information system research (ethics)? Each of these questions is explored from the internal perspective of the particular ISD approach. The paper addresses these questions through a conceptual structure which is based on a paradigmatic framework for analyzing ISD approaches.","Assumption Analysis; Information Systems Development; Information Systems Development Methodologies and Approaches; Paradigmatic Analysis; Paradigms","Information systems; Management information systems; Philosophical aspects; Assumption Analysis; Information systems development; Information systems development methodologies; Paradigmatic Analysis; Paradigms; Speech analysis","","","","","","","Applegate L., Managing in the Information Age: Transforming the Organization in the 1990's, IFIP 8.2 Proceedings on Information Technology and New Emergent Forms of Organizations, (1994); Andersen N., Kensing F., Lundin J., Mathiassen L., Munk-Madsen A., Rasbech M., Sorgaard P., Professional Systems Development: Experience, Ideas and Action, (1990); Argyris C., Schon D., Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, (1978); Astley W.G., Sachdava P.S., Structural Sources of Intraorganizational Power: A Theoretical Synthesis, Acad.

Developing an effective multinational Internet presence requires designing web sites that operate in a diverse, multi-cultural environment. This is not simple, given that the field of web site development has lacked standards and rules relating to content and design. This study develops a conceptual model that differentiates web site content from design. The content component addresses the issue of what is included in the site and identifies the various types of information. The design component addresses presentation and navigational features. This conceptual web site content/design model was used to study the features of global corporate web sites to determine if the content and design features have become globally standardized or if differences exist as a result of national culture and/or industry. The majority of web site content features were found to be significantly different across various cultural groups. This, however, was not the case for design features. Furthermore, there appeared to be little association between the content and design features and industry classification. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet recent research has illustrated a gap between the espoused theory of a best practice solution and the theory-in-use experienced by those who install software with such a design. As researchers begin to examine the difficult process by which organizations recast the best practices model handed down to them by consultancies and software vendors in an effort to make the software 'work for them' in practice, it is equally important that we begin to understand the reasons that such a gap exists. To this end, we analyze the strategic partnership between a multinational software vendor and a university who together designed a 'best practice' ERP package for the higher education industry. Through the theoretical lens of 'epistemic cultures' we argue that in organizational contexts made up of more than one epistemic culture, the use of a best practice model will be problematic because, by definition, the model mandates one epistemological position through the software design. This is counter to a university's loosely coupled organizational form. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we demonstrate that IT strategic role can explain how IT investments in each of the IT strategic roles might affect the firm's competitive position and ultimately firm value. We find positive, abnormal returns to announcements of IT investments by firms making transformative IT investments, and with membership in industries with transform IT strategic roles. The results of previous research are not found to be significant when IT strategic role is included as an explanatory variable. These results provide support for the value of capturing the IT strategic role of a firm's IT-related competitive maneuvering in studies striving to understand the conditions under which IT investments are likely to produce out-of-the-ordinary, positive returns.","Event study; IT investment; IT strategic role; Stock market reaction","Information analysis; Investments; Management information systems; Performance; Strategic planning; Event study; Stock market reaction; Stock prices; Information technology","","","","","","","Armstrong C., Sambamurthy V., Information technology assimilation in firms: The influence of senior leadership and IT infrastructures, Information Systems Research, 10, 4, pp. 304-327, (1999); Atiase R.K., Predisclosure information, firm capitalization and security price behavior around earnings announcements, Journal of Accounting Research, 23, 1, pp. 21-36, (1985); Barua A., Mukhopadhyay I., Information technology and business performance: Past, present and future, Framing the Domains of IT Management: Projecting the Future Through the Past, pp. 65-84, (2000); Brown S.J., Warner J.B., Using daily stock returns: The case of event studies, Journal of Financial Economics, 14, 1, pp. 3-31, (1985); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., Competing on the Edge: Strategy As Structured Chaos, (1998); Brynjolfsson E., Information assets, technology and organization, Management Science, 40, 12, pp. 1645-1662, (1994); Brynjolfsson E., Hitt L., Is information systems spending productive?

Earlier research has suggested that single-project management may be related to project portfolio-level success, but empirical evidence has been scarce. A questionnaire survey with 279 firms verifies the hypothesized role of information availability, goal setting and systematic decision making in achieving portfolio management efficiency. The results reveal a mediating and direct role of project management efficiency but reject the hypothesized link between reaching project goals and portfolio management efficiency. The results imply that understanding of portfolio-level issues needs to be considered as part of project managers' capabilities and not only a top management concern. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Efficiency; Implementing strategy; Managing programmes; Managing projects; Project portfolio management","Decision making; Management information systems; System program documentation; project management; strategic approach; Implementing strategy; Managing programmes; Managing projects; Project portfolio management; Project management","","","","","","","Archer N., Ghasemzadeh F., Project portfolio selection techniques a review and a suggested integrated approach, Project portfolio management.

The usage frequency of essentially all information sources was positively related to perceived accessibility; however, usage frequency also tended to be positively related to environmental complexity. These results suggest that the information‐gathering requirements associated with an individual's job may necessitate the use of less accessible sources, and this finding represents a break with prior research.

However, our review of papers in the two leading IS journals from 2000 to 2016 suggests that IS research has lost sight of the discipline’s sociotechnical character—a character that was widely acknowledged at the discipline’s inception. This is a problem because an axis of cohesion can be fundamental to a discipline’s long-term vitality. In order to address this issue, we offer ways to renew the sociotechnical perspective so that it can continue to serve as a distinctive and coherent foundation for the discipline. Our hope is that the renewed sociotechnical frame for the IS discipline discussed in the paper holds potential to contribute to the enduring strength of our diverse, distinctive, yet unified discipline. It also prompts members of the discipline to think more deeply about what it means to be an IS scholar. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

Sciences Department, Bauer College of Business, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States","Employing media richness theory, a model is developed to open the black box surrounding the impact of computer-mediated communication systems on decision quality. The effects on decision quality of two important communication system factors, cue multiplicity and feedback immediacy, are examined in light of three important mediating constructs: social perceptions, message clarity, and ability to evaluate others. A laboratory experiment examining two tasks and employing face-to-face, electronic meeting, electronic conferencing, and electronic mail communication systems is used to assess the model's validity. Results provide consistent support for the research model as well as media richness theory. Richer media facilitate social perceptions (total socio-emotional communication and positive socio-emotional climate) and perceived ability to evaluate others' deception and expertise. Leaner media (electronic mail and electronic conferencing) facilitate communication clarity when participants have less task-relevant knowledge. The impacts of these mediating constructs on decision quality were found to depend on the levels of participant expertise and deception. In general, it was found that richer media can have significantly positive impacts on decision quality when participants' task-relevant knowledge is high. Moreover, effects of participant deception can be mitigated by employing richer media.","Computer-mediated communication; Feedback immediacy; Group performance; Group processes; Media richness theory;

For the most part the group decision support system effort has been concerned with demonstrating the usefulness of the technology in planning and decisionmaking situations where the quality of the meeting's outcomes can be objectively assessed. In many decision situations, however, there is no objective measure of decision quality available. Rather, the group must reconcile differences in opinion, personal preference, or judgment and achieve consensus about a particular mode of action. As a contribution to the accumulating research on GDSS, the current study examines the effects of a GDSS in resolving conflicts of personal preference. In a task requiring resolution of competing personal preferences, 82 groups - the largest sample size in the GDSS literature to date - were randomly assigned to one of three experiment conditions: (1) a computer-based support system (GDSS); (2) a manual, paper and pencil, support system; or (3) no support whatsoever. Groups were either of size 3 or 4 persons. Use of the GDSS was expected to facilitate democratic participation in group discussion, move group members toward agreement with one another, and result in a high level of satisfaction with the group decision process. While several of the intended effects of the technology were observed, the groups experienced some unintended consequences as a result of using the GDSS. In general, the GDSS technology appeared to offer some advantage over no support, but little advantage over the pencil and paper method of supporting group discussion.","Decision support; Group decision support systems;

However, a review of the literature reveals that very few studies have systematically examined value cocreation within business-tobusiness (B2B) contexts. Using a revelatory case study of the relationship between an ERP vendor with a global reputation and its partners, and informed by the resource-based view of the firm and related theoretical perspectives, we develop an understanding of value cocreation in B2B alliances associated with selling, extending, and implementing packaged software, specifically ERP systems. Our study reveals that there are different mechanisms underlying value cocreation within B2B alliances, and also points to several categories of contingency factors that influence these mechanisms. In addition to providing insights about the phenomenon of cocreation itself, the study contributes to the stream of packaged software literature, where the implications of value cocreation in alliances between packaged software vendors and their partners for the client organizations have not been sufficiently explored.","Business-to-business alliance;

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly viewed as a useful resource in programs that provide settlement services or promote participation in society. This paper moves beyond the conventional discussion on the digital divide to explore what people are actually able to do and achieve with ICTs. We draw on an analysis of the use of ICTs for particular purposes by more than 50 resettled refugees to develop an explanation of the process by which ICT use contributes to their social inclusion. We propose that ICT constitutes a resource from which a set of five valuable capabilities is derived: to participate in an information society, to communicate effectively, to understand a new society, to be socially connected, and to express a cultural identity. In realizing these capabilities through ICT use, refugees exercise their agency and enhance their well-being in ways that assist them to function effectively in a new society and regain control over their disrupted lives.","Agency; Capability approach; Information and communication technology; Refugees; Social inclusion; Wellbeing","Management information systems; Agency; Capability approach; Information and Communication Technologies; Refugees; Social inclusion; Wellbeing; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Alkire S., Why the capability approach?, Journal of Human Development, 6, 1, pp. 115-135, (2005); Avgerou C., Social mechanisms for causal explanation in social theory based IS research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 14, 8, pp. 399-419, (2013); Beck E., Madon S., Sahay S., On the margins of the 'information society': A comparative study of mediation, The Information Society, 20, 4, pp. 279-290, (2004); Benitez J.L., Salvadoran transnational families: ICT and communication practices in the network society, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 38, 9, pp. 1439-1449, (2012); Caidi N., Allard D., Quirke L., Information practices of immigrants, Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 44, 1, pp. 491-531, (2010); Cass N., Shove E., Urry J., Social exclusion, mobility and access, The Sociological Review, 53, 3, pp. 539-555, (2005); Castells M., The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business, and Society, (2001); Clark D.A., Sen's capability approach and the many spaces of human well-being, The Journal of Development Studies, 41, 8, pp. 1339-1368, (2005); Craig B., Williams J.E., Research informing practice: Toward effective engagement in community ICT in New Zealand, Journal of Community Informatics, 7, (2011); Dreze J., Sen A.K., India: Development and Participation, (2002); Emirbayer M., Mische A., What is agency?, American Journal of Sociology, 103, 4, pp. 962-1023, (1998); Gifford S.M., Wilding R., Digital escapes?

Data was collected by conducting interviews at various levels of the subject organizations and by examining their archived records when available. The study proposes that a cautious, evolutionary, bureaucratic implementation process backed with careful change management, network relationships, and cultural readiness can lead to a successful ERP project implementation as opposed to a revolutionary project scope mandated autocratically by top management without organizational readiness and proper change management.

Stock market investors provide one appropriate perspective on the value-creation and growth potential of IT infrastructure investments through their reactions to specific IT infrastructure investment moves by business firms. This research utilizes the eventstudy analysis approach to examine if IT infrastructure investments are associated with significantly positive abnormal stock market returns and rises in trading volume when firms announce such investments. Drawing upon a sample of IT infrastructure announcements in the early 1990s, this research finds significant evidence that positive abnormal returns and increased trading volume are associated with IT infrastructure investment announcements. Further, when such investments are contrasted with investments in IT applications, evidence exists that infrastructure investments generate greater excess returns and a larger increase in trading volume than applications investments do. The evidence provides empirical support for the potential of IT infrastructure investments to be perceived as a platform for growth and revenue generation opportunities in contemporary business firms.","Event study;

It is based on a theoretical input-output model of the IS function's role in supporting business process effectiveness and organizational performance. The research model consists of three system output dimensions - systems performance, information effectiveness, and service performance. The ""updated paradigm"" for instrument development was followed to develop and validate the ISFS instrument. Construct validation of the instrument was conducted using responses from 346 systems users in 149 organizations by a combination of exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using LISREL. The process resulted in an instrument that measures 18 unidimensional factors within the three ISFS dimensions. Moreover, a sample of 120 matched-paired responses of separate CIO and user responses was used for nomological validation. The results showed that the ISFS measure reflected by the instrument was positively related to improvements in business processes effectiveness and organizational performance. Consequently, the instrument may be used for assessing IS performance, for guiding information technology investment and sourcing decisions, and as a basis for further research and instrument development. © 2005 M.E.

In this article, the discourse about their vision is extended by considering the potential for the IS field to contribute to new product development (NPD) research. It is argued that the rapid infusion of information technology (IT) along four dimensions of product development - process management, project management, information and knowledge management, and collaboration and communication - raises several important NPD research issues. These issues could be addressed by drawing from extant theories and models in the IS field. By employing NPD as the context, other issues that underlie the new role envisioned for the IS field are also identified.","Diffusion of research; IS research agenda; IS research issues; IT infusion;

A conceptual framework is proposed to define four components of ISDP complexity: structural organizational complexity, structural IT complexity, dynamic organizational complexity, and dynamic IT complexity. Measures of ISDP complexity are generated based on literature review, field interviews, and focus group discussions. The measures are then refined through a systematic process and are tested using confirmatory data analyses with survey responses from 541 ISDP managers. Results support the final measurement model that consists of a second-order factor of ISDP complexity, four distinct first-order factors, and 15 measurement items. The measurement adequately satisfies the criteria for unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, reliability, factorial invariance across different types of ISDPs, and nomological validity. Implications of the study results to research and practice as well as limitations of the study and directions for future research are discussed. © 2005 M.E.

Stem School of Business, New York University","This paper explores the use of contingency theory in the field of Management Information Systems (MIS). The development of contingency theory in MIS is compared to the development of organization theory. The assumptions of fit, performance as a dependent variable, rational actors, and a deterministic model in both organizational research and MIS research are critiqued. The dominant influence of contingency theory is demonstrated through a review of empirical studies published in J MIS and MIS Quarterly. Of the 177 articles during the period studied, 59 percent were empirical and over 70 percent of these were judged to follow a contingency model. Based on our assessment of this research, we conclude that research in MIS has been hampered by the use of a naive meta-theory, conflicting empirical results with low explained variance, ill-defined concepts of performance and fit, and a narrow perspective of researchers. We give some recommendations for improving the theoretical basis of MIS, including advocating more subjectivist, less functional, and less deterministic research approaches. We also suggest a wider selection of methodologies including qualitative case studies, longitudinal studies, and ethnographic approaches. Finally, we conclude that significantly more theory-building is required in defining the MIS construct.","Contingency theory; Management information systems; Organization theory; Research methodology in MIS","","","","","","","","Aiken M., Hage J., Organizational interdependence and intra-organizational structure, American Sociological Review, 33, pp. 912-930, (1968);

The basis for this instrument was a published framework that suggests three categories of such benefits: strategic, informational, and transactional. In a cross-sectional study of 178 IS projects proposed and approved for development, this framework was operationalized and empirically tested using the measurement model of LISREL. The analysis culminated in the validation and refinement of the these categories. The final instrument offers items under three separate subdimensions of strategic benefits: competitive advantage, alignment, and customer relations. Informational benefits are similarly comprised of information access, information quality, and information flexibility. Finally, transactional benefits are also shown to be of three types: communications efficiency, systems development efficiency, and business efficiency. Implications of this multidimensional instrument for IS practitioners and researchers are discussed.","Information management; Management information systems; Measurement","","","","","","","","Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988);

Yet, more and more brick-and-mortar banks and other businesses are investing in online Web sites that supposedly ""leverage""positive consumer impressions of their offline business. The main purpose of this study is to test empirically whether or not trust in an offline bank transfers (i.e., influences) perceptions about that company's online bank. In order to do so, we analyze how trust in an offline bank influences four perceptions about its online banking counterpart (flow, structural assurance, perceived Web site satisfaction, and perceived extent of future use). The study tests the hypothesized influence of offline trust using a sample of 199 South Korean consumers responding about offline and online banking. Results show that offline trust influences all four online perceptions, just as proposed. These effects were especially prominent among respondents new to online banking. Thus, offline-to-online transfer should be considered when designing strategies for online channels. This study fills a key research gap by examining transfer of cognitive beliefs from an offline to an online setting. © 2007 IEEE.","Banking; Cognitive overhead; Coherence; Customer relationship management; Electronic commerce; Extent of use; Flow; Marketing channel; Online banking; Online trust; Structural assurance; Trust; Trust transfer; Web site satisfaction; Web sites","Administrative data processing; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Websites; Customer relationship management; Online banking; Online trust; Trust transfer; Web site satisfaction; Management information systems","","","","","Samsung Research Fund; Sungkyunkwan University, SKKU","Manuscript received May 1, 2005; revised November 1, 2005, February 1, 2006, and July 1, 2006.

There is much potential for conflict in GVTs as members work across cultural, geographical, and time boundaries. This study examines the antecedents of GVT conflict and the circumstances under which conflict affects team performance. An in-depth study of GVT conflict episodes was carried out using interviews, observations, communication logs, and documents. Based on findings from the teams under study interpreted in the light of prior literature, propositions are developed about the antecedents and effects of GVT conflict as stated. Within GVTs, cultural diversity is likely to contribute to both task and relationship conflict while functional diversity may result in task conflict. Large volumes of electronic communication and lack of immediacy of feedback in asynchronous media can contribute to task conflict. Moreover, the relationship between task conflict and team performance is likely to be contingent upon task complexity and conflict resolution approach. The influence of relationship conflict on performance may depend on task interdependence and conflict resolution approach. The conflict resolution approach may in turn be determined by the nature of conflict attribution. These propositions have been synthesized into a model to guide future empirical research and GVT practice. © 2007 M.E.

This study theorizes that effective processing and management of customer information flows requires organizations to possess ""relational information processing capability"" (RIPC) and ""analytical information processing capability"" (AIPC). Drawing on and extending the theories of absorptive capacity and complementarities in the context of innovation, we posit that RIPC and AIPC complement product-focused customer involvement (PCI) and information-intensive customer involvement (ICI) practices, respectively, to enhance the amount of firm innovation. To test our hypotheses, we collected archival data from more than 300 large U.S. manufacturing firms and mapped their RIPC and AIPC to specific IT applications. Consistent with our theorizing, we find that RIPC positively moderates the relationship between PCI and amount of firm innovation and that AIPC positively moderates the relationship between ICI and amount of firm innovation. In further exploratory analysis, we find a positive three-way interaction between AIPC, RIPC, and PCI. Taken together, the results suggest that configurations of IT-enabled capabilities alone are not enough for innovation; instead, firms benefit more when specific configurations of IT-enabled capabilities are leveraged in unison with specific types of customer involvement. The study contributes to theory and practice by shedding light on important complementarities between specific types of customer involvement (PCI and ICI) and specific IT-enabled capabilities (RIPC and AIPC).","Analytical information processing capability;

To explain such failures, we draw on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm to define various dimensions of information systems (IS) resources. Using resource-picking and capability-building arguments, we examine the relationships between IS resources and ERP capabilities to find out whether they have complementary effects on outcomes. Empirical results from a survey of manufacturing firms that recently implemented ERP systems support the hypothesized model. For IS research, this study further develops the complementary and capability-building roles of IS resources, integrates RBV into our current knowledge of ERP implementation, and provides theoretical explanations for when or under what conditions building ERP capabilities has the highest impact on business process outcomes. For IS practice, it emphasizes the importance of IS resources in building ERP capabilities, provides preliminary measures for IS resource dimensions, and demonstrates their impact on firms' ERP capabilities and consequent business process outcomes. © 2007 M.E.

We agree with many of their observations, but we are concerned with their prescription for IS research. We critique their discussion of errors of inclusion and exclusion in IS research and highlight the potential misinterpretations that are possible from a literalreading of their comments. Our conclusion is that following Benbasat and Zmud's nomological net will result in a micro focus for IS research. The results of such a focus are potentially dangerous for the field. They could result in the elimination of IS from many academic programs. We present an alternative set of heuristics that can be used to assess what lies within the domain of IS scholarship. We argue that the IS community has a powerful story to tell about the transformational impact of information technology. We believe that a significant portion of our research should be macro studies of the impact of IT. It is important for academic colleagues, deans, and managers to understand the transformational power of the technology. As IS researchers with deep knowledge of the underlying artifact, we are best positioned to do such research.","IS identity crisis; Macro studies of IT; Transformational impact of IT","Heuristic methods; Information analysis; Information technology; Information use; Academic programs; Information Systems identity crisis; Macro studies; Transformational impact; Management information systems","","","","","","","Alter S., 18 Reasons Why IT-Reliant Work Systems Should Replace ""The IT Artifact"" as the Core Subject Matter of the IS Field, Communications of the AIS, 12, pp. 366-395, (2003); Alter S., The IS Core XI: Sorting Out Issues About the Core, Scope and Identity of the IS Field, Communications of the AIS, 12, pp. 607-628, (2003); Bakos Y., Lucas Jr. H.C., Oh W., Simon G., Viswanathan S., Weber B., The Impact of Electronic Commerce on Competition in the Retail Brokerage Industry, Information Systems Research, (2005); Benbasat I., Zmud R., The Identity Crisis Within the IS Discipline: Defining and Communicating the Discipline's Core Properties, MIS Quarterly, 27, 2, pp. 183-194, (2003); Deans P.C., The IS Core III: The Core Domain Debate and the International Business Discipline: A Comparison, Communications of the AIS, 12, pp. 546-552, (2003); DeSanctis G., The Social Life of Information Systems Research: A Response to Benbasat and Zmud's Call for Returning to the IT Artifact, Journal of the AIS, 4, 7, pp. 360-376, (2003); Dufner D., The IS Core I: Economic and Systems Engineering Approaches to IS Identity, Communications of the AIS, 12, pp. 527-538, (2003); El Sawy O.A., The IS Core IX: The 3 Faces of IS Identity: Connection, Immersion, and Fusion, Communications of the AIS, 12, pp. 588-598, (2003); Galliers R.D., Change as Crisis or Growth?

While much is known about different social, cognitive, and technical factors that influence initial adoption and use, less is known about the role of emotional factors in users' behaviors. Through an in-depth field study conducted in two North American universities, we examine the role of emotions in how specific IT use patterns emerge. We find that there are five different characteristics of an IT stimulus event (cues) that, when interacting in a reinforcing manner, elicit a single class of emotions (uniform affective responses) and, when interacting in an oppositional manner, elicit mixed emotions (ambivalent affective responses). While users respond to uniform emotions with clear adaptation strategies, they deal with ambivalent emotions by combining different adaptation behaviors, a vacillating strategy between emphasizing positive and negative aspects of the stimulus. Surprisingly, these ambivalent emotions and vacillating strategies can lead to active and positive user engagement, exhibited in task and tool adaptation behaviors and improvisational use patterns that, despite their nonconformity to terms of use, can have positive organizational implications. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation behaviors; Ambivalence; Emotions; IT use patterns; Qualitative research","Management information systems; Adaptation behaviors; Ambivalence; Emotions; IT use patterns; Qualitative research; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Alvarez R., Examining technology, structure and identity during an enterprise system implementation, Information Systems Journal, 18, 2, pp. 203-224, (2008); Ashforth B.E., Rogers K.M., Pratt M.G., Pradies C., Ambivalence in organizations: A multilevel approach, Organization Science, 25, 5, pp. 1453-1478, (2014); Bagayogo F., Beaudry A., Lapointe L., Impacts of it acceptance and resistance behaviors: A novel framework, Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Information Systems, (2013); Bagozzi R.P., The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 8, 4, pp. 244-254, (2007); Barki H., Titah R., Boffo C., Information system use-related activity: An expanded behavioral conceptualization of individual-level information system use, Information Systems Research, 18, 2, pp. 173-192, (2007); Beaudry A., Pinsonneault A., Understanding user responses to information technology: A coping model of user adaptation, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 493-524, (2005); Beaudry A., Pinsonneault A., The other side of acceptance: Studying the direct and indirect effects of emotions on information technology use, MIS Quarterly, 34, 4, pp. 689-710, (2010); Bhattacherjee A., Understanding information systems conti nuance: An expectation-confirmation model, MIS Quarterly, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001); Boudens C.J., The story of work: A narrative analysis of workplace emotion, Organization Studies, 26, 9, pp. 1285-1306, (2005); Burton-Jones A., Gallivan M.J., Toward a deeper understanding of system usage in organizations: A multilevel perspective, MIS Quarterly, 31, 4, pp. 657-679, (2007); Burton-Jones A., Grange C., From use to effective use: A representation theory perspective, Information Systems Research, 24, 3, pp. 632-658, (2013); Burton-Jones A., Straub D.W., Reconceptualizing system usage: An approach and empirical test, Information Systems Research, 17, 3, pp. 228-246, (2006); Cenfetelli R.T., Getting in touch with our feelings towards technology, Proceedings of the Academy of Management Conference, pp. F1-F6, (2004); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user scceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Edmondson A., McManus S., Methodological fit in management field research, The Academy of Management Review, 32, 4, pp. 1155-1179, (2007); Elfenbein H.A., Emotion in organizations: A review and theoretical integration, Academy of Management Annals, 1, 1, pp. 315-386, (2007); Ferneley E.H., Sobreperez P., Resist, comply or workaround?

We ask: is systems development the rational process so eloquently described in the ""classic"" works of DeMarco (1978), Gane and Sarson (1979), Weinberg (1980), Yourdon (1982), Jackson (1983), and Martin (1985)? Or does this orthodox view fail to explain the actual practice of systems development? It is our view that even the basic assumptions about the rationality of the actors and the social processes they engage in need to be critically appraised. We suggest that if the assumptions about economic rationality are closely analyzed, it can be seen that they do not reflect the reality of systems development. ISD tends to defy rational explanations. As an alternative to basing our understanding of systems development on economic rationality, we contend that symbolism holds more promise. Instead of focusing on data flow diagrams, structured walkthroughs, requirements specifications, and the like, we concentrate on the role of myth, metaphor, and magic. These concepts offer considerable scope in interpreting the social actions that are embodied within ISD. We feel they facilitate a much richer understanding of systems development.

In this paper, we go beyond the dominant firm-level alignment paradigm by utilizing a value disciplines perspective on strategic foci to conceptualize alignment at the process level. Theory would then suggest that alignment should be tightest in processes that are considered critical to each firm's strategic focus. Using data from matched surveys of IT and business executives at 241 firms, we detect support for this locus of alignment argument when alignment is identified using profile deviation or moderation. We also find a positive link between alignment and perceived IT business value in each of five primary processes in the value chain. By bringing a process-level view to the study of alignment and its impacts, we go beyond a discussion on the extent of fit - a cornerstone of the literature - to whether firms are pursuing the right type of fit for the particular mix of processes underlying their strategy. In this way, a process-level perspective can foster a deeper and more meaningful understanding of how alignment affects firm performance. Our results also show a need for managers to reconsider the steps taken to align IT and business strategy by looking more closely at how IT can support individual processes rather than at how IT can support an entire strategy. © 2008 M.E.

The five research streams we identify incorporate different definitions of the managerial problems that relate to IS, the alternate theoretical perspectives and different methodological paradigms to study them, and the levels of the organization at which their primary results impact managerial practice. The decision support and design science research stream studies the application of computers in decision support, control, and managerial decision making. The value of information research stream reflects relationships established based on economic analysis of information as a commodity in the management of the firm. The human-computer systems design research stream emphasizes the cognitive basis for effective systems design. The IS organization and strategy research stream focuses the level of analysis on the locus of value of the IS investment instead of on the perceptions of a system or its user. The economics of information systems and technology research stream emphasizes the application of theoretical perspectives and methods from analytical and empirical economics to managerial problems involving IS and information technologies (IT). Based on a discussion of these streams, we evaluate the IS literature's core contributions to theoretical and managerial knowledge, and make some predictions about the road that lies ahead for IS researchers.","Decision support systems;

The paper suggests that IT innovation theory needs to be expanded to analyze IT innovations in kind that exhibit atypical discontinuities in IT innovation behaviors by studying two questions. First, can a model of disruptive IT innovations be created to understand qualitative changes in IT development processes and their outcomes so that they can be related to architectural discontinuities in computing capability? Second, to what extent can the observed turmoil among systems development organizations that has been spawned by Internet computing be understood as a disruptive IT innovation? To address the first question, a model of disruptive IT innovation is developed. The model defines a disruptive IT innovation as an architectural innovation originating in the information technology base that has subsequent pervasive and radical impacts on development processes and their outcomes. These base innovations establish necessary but not sufficient conditions for subsequent innovation behaviors. To address the second question, the impact of Internet computing on eight leading-edge systems development organizations in the United States and Finland is investigated. The study shows that the adoption of Internet computing in these firms has radically impacted their IT innovation both in development processes and services.","Disruptive IT innovation; Innovation theory; Internet computing; IT innovation cores; System development, software management, it applications","Communication systems; Computer software; Internet; Management information systems; Societies and institutions; Empirical validation; Innovation theory; Internet computing; Software management; Information technology","","","","","","","Abernathy W., Clark K., Innovation: Mapping the winds of creative destruction, Research Policy, 14, 1, pp. 3-22, (1985); Abrahamson E., Management fashion, Academy of Management Review, 21, 1, pp. 254-285, (1996); Alter S., Ein-Dor P., Markus L., Scott J., Vessey I., Does the trend toward e-business call for changes in the fundamental concepts of information systems?

We test this conjecture using the revenue distributions of books in over 200 distinct categories on Amazon.com and detailed daily snapshots of co-purchase recommendation networks in which the products of these categories are situated. We measure how much a product is influenced by its position in this hyperlinked network of recommendations using a variant of Google's PageRank measure of centrality. We then associate the average influence of the network on each category with the inequality in the distribution of its demand and revenue, quantifying this inequality using the Gini coefficient derived from the category's Lorenz curve. We establish that categories whose products are influenced more by the recommendation network have significantly flatter demand and revenue distributions, even after controlling for variation in average category demand, category size, and price differentials. Our empirical findings indicate that doubling the average network influence on a category is associated with an average increase of about 50 percent in the relative revenue for the least popular 20 percent of products, and with an average reduction of about 15 percent in the relative revenue for the most popular 20 percent of products. We also show that this effect is enhanced by higher assortative mixing and lower clustering in the network, and is greater in categories whose products are more evenly influenced by recommendations. The direction of these results persists over time, across both demand and revenue distributions, and across both daily and weekly demand aggregations. Our work illustrates how the microscopic economic data revealed by online networks can be used to define and answer new kinds of research questions, offers a fresh perspective on the influence of networked IT artifacts on business outcomes, and provides novel empirical evidence about the impact of visible recommendations on the long tail of electronic commerce.","Electronic commerce;

In other words, only once a specific isolated option is identified as being embedded in a target IT investment, does this research call upon using real options analysis to evaluate the option. In effect, however, because real options are not inherent in any IT investment, they usually must be planned and intentionally embedded in a target IT investment in order to control various investment-specific risks, just like financial risk management uses carefully chosen options to actively manage investment risks. Moreover, when an IT investment involves multiple risks, there could be numerous ways to reconfigure the investment using different series of cascading (compound) options. In this light, we present an approach for managing IT investment risk that helps to rationally choose which options to deliberately embed in an investment so as to optimally control the balance between risk and reward. We also illustrate how the approach is applied to an IT investment entailing the establishment of an Internet sales channel.","Information technology investment evaluation; Information technology investment management; Information technology investment risk; Information technology investments; Option-pricing models; Real options; Risk management","Electronic commerce; Information technology; Internet; Investments; Risk management; Information technology investments; Management information systems","","","","","","","Alter S., Ginzberg M., Managing uncertainty in MIS implementation, Sloan Management Review, 20, 1, pp. 23-31, (1978); Amram M., Kulatilaka N., Disciplined decisions: Aligning strategy with the financial markets, Harvard Business Review, 77, 1, pp. 95-104, (1999); Benaroch M., Kauffman R.J., A case for using real option pricing analysis to evaluate information technology project investments, Information Systems Research, 10, 1, pp. 70-86, (1999); Benaroch M., Kauffman R.J., Justifying electronic banking network expansion using real options analysis, MIS Quarterly, 24, 2, pp. 197-225, (2000); Boehm B., Software Risk Management, (1989); Bowman E.H., Hurry D., Strategy through the option lens: An integrated view of resource investments and the incremental-choice process, Academy of Management Review, 18, 4, pp. 760-782, (1993); Broadbent M., Weill P., St. Clair D., The implications of information technology infrastructure for business process redesign, (1998); Carr P., The valuation of sequential exchange opportunities, Journal of Finance, 43, 5, pp. 1235-1256, (1988); Clemons E.K., Evaluating strategic investments in information systems, Communications of the ACM, 34, 1, pp. 22-36, (1991); Clemons E.K., Weber B., Strategic information technology investments: Guidelines for decision making, Journal of Management Information Systems, 7, 2, pp. 9-28, (1990); Copeland T.S., Keenan P.T., How much is flexibility worth?, McKinsey Quarterly, 2, pp. 38-49, (1998); Davis G.B., Strategies for information requirements determination, IBM Systems Journal, 21, 1, pp. 4-30, (1982); Deise M.V., Nowikow C., King P., Weight A., Executive's Guide to E-Business, (2000); Dixit A.K., Pindyck R.S., Investment Under Uncertainty, (1994); Dos Santos B.L., Justifying investment in new information technologies, Journal of Management Information Systems, 7, 4, pp. 71-89, (1991); Erdogmus H., Vandergraaf J., Quantitative approaches for assessing the value of COTS -centric development, Sixth International Symposium on Software Metrics (METRICS'99), (1999); Gamba A., Trigeorgis L., A log-transformed binomial lattice extension for multi-dimensional option problems, Fifth Annual Conference on Real Options, (2001); Hull J.C., Options, Futures, and Other Derivative Securities, 2d ed., (1993); Kambil A., Henderson C.J., Mohsenzadeh H., Strategic management of information technology: An options perspective, Strategic Information Technology Management: Perspectives on Organizational Growth and Competitive Advantage, pp. 161-178, (1993); Keen D.G., Shaping the Future: Business Design Through Information Technology, (1991); Keil M., Cule P.E., Lyytinen K., Schmidt R.C., A framework for identifying software project risk, Communications of the ACM, 41, 11, pp. 76-83, (1998); Kemerer C.F., Sosa G.L., Systems development challenges in strategic use of information systems, Information and Software Technology, 33, 3, pp. 212-223, (1991); Kulatilaka N., Balasubramanian P., Strock J., Using real options to frame the IT investment problem, Real Options and Business Strategy: Applications to Decision-Making, pp. 185-224, (1999); Luehrman T.A., Investment opportunities as real options: Getting started on the numbers, Harvard Business Review, 76, 4, pp. 3-15, (1998); Lyytinen K., Mathiassen L., Ropponen J., Attention shaping and software risk-A categorical analysis of four classical risk management approaches, Information Systems Research, 9, 3, pp. 233-255, (1998); Mason S., Merton R., The role of contingent claims analysis in corporate finance, Recent Advances in Corporate Finance, pp. 7-54, (1985); McFarlan W., Portfolio approach to information systems, Journal of Systems Management, 33, 1, pp. 12-19, (1982); Richmond W.B., Seidmann A., Software development outsourcing contract structure and business value, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 1, pp. 57-72, (1993); Smith J.R., Nau R.F., Valuing risky projects: Option pricing theory and decision analysis, Management Science, 41, 5, pp. 795-816, (1995); Taudes A., Software growth options, Journal of Management Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 165-185, (1998); Taudes A., Feurstein M., Mild A., Options analysis of software platform decisions: A case study, MIS Quarterly, 24, 2, pp. 227-243, (2000); Trigeorgis L., Real Options, (1996); Zhu K., Evaluating information technology investment: Cash flows or growth options?, Workshop on Information Systems Economics (WISE'99), (1999)","","","M.E.

Prior literature is used to develop the research model, including hypotheses about the effects of four knowledge management processes (internalization, externalization, socialization, and combination) on perceived individual-level, group-level, and organizational-level knowledge management effectiveness. The study was conducted at the John F. Kennedy Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration using a survey of 159 individuals and two rounds of personal interviews. Structural equation modeling was performed to test measurement and structural models using the survey data. The emergent model suggests that internalization and externalization impact perceived effectiveness of individual-level knowledge management. Socialization and combination influence perceived effectiveness of knowledge management at group and organizational levels, respectively. The results also support the expected upward impact in perceived effectiveness of knowledge management, from individual to group level, as well as from group level to organizational level. The study's limitations and implications for practice and future research are described.","Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Multiple regression; Structural equation modeling; Survey research","","","","","","","","Alavi M., Leidner D.E., Knowledge management systems: Issues, challenges, and benefits, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 1, 7, (1999); Alavi M., Leidner D.E., Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues, MIS Quarterly, 25, 1, (2001); Anderson J.C., An approach for confirmatory measurement and structural equation modeling of organizational properties, Management Science, 33, 4, pp. 525-541, (1987); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Argote L., Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining, and Transferring Knowledge, (1999); Argyris C., Organizational learning and management information systems, Accounting, Organizations, and Society, 2, 2, pp. 113-123, (1977); Argyris C., Schon D., Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, (1978); Armbrecht F.M.R., Chapas R.B., Chappelow C.C., Farris G.F., Friga P.N., Hartz C.A., McIlvaine M.E., Postle S.R., Whitwell G.E., Knowledge management in research and development, Research Technology Management, 44, 4, pp. 28-48, (2001); Babin B.J., Boles J.S., Employee behavior in a service environment: A model and test of potential differences between men and women, Journal of Marketing, 62, 2, pp. 77-91, (1998); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural evaluation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Baker J., Parasuraman A., Grewal D., Voss G.B., The influence of multiple store environment cues on perceived merchandise value and patronage intentions, Journal of Marketing, 66, 2, pp. 120-141, (2002); Baum J.R., Locke E.A., Smith K.G., A multidimensional model of venture growth, Academy of Management Journal, 44, 2, pp. 292-303, (2001); Bentler P.M., Bonnett D.G., Significance tests and goodness-of-fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, NOVEMBER, pp. 588-606, (1980); Boland R.J., Tenkasi R.V., Perspective making and perspective taking in communities of practice, Organization Science, 6, 4, pp. 350-372, (1995); Brown J.S., Duguid P., Organizational learning and communitiesof-practice: Toward a unified view of working, learning, and innovation, Organization Science, 2, 1, pp. 40-57, (1991); Buenger V., Daft R.L., Conlon E.J., Austin J., Competing values in organizations: Contextual influences and structural consequence, Organization Science, 7, 5, pp. 557-576, (1996); Burrell G., Morgan G., Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analysis, (1979); Carmines E.G., McIver S.P., Analyzing models with unobserved variables: Analysis of covariance structures, Social Measurement: Current Issues, pp. 65-115, (1981); Chin W.W., Newsted P.R., The importance of specification in causal modeling: The case of end-user computing satisfaction, Information Systems Research, 6, 1, pp. 73-81, (1995); Churchman C.W., The Design of Inquiring Systems: Basic Concepts of Systems and Organizations, (1972); Cohen W.M., Levinthal D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 1, pp. 128-152, (1990); Conner K.R., A historical comparison of resource-based theory and five schools of thought within industrial organization economics: Do we have a new theory of the firm?, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 121-155, (1991); Conner K.R., Prahalad C.K., A resource-based theory of the firm: Knowledge versus opportunism, Organization Science, 7, 5, pp. 477-501, (1996); Daft R.L., Weick K.E., Toward a model of organizations as interpretation systems, Academy of Management Review, 9, 2, pp. 284-295, (1984); Davenport T., Prusak L., Working Knowledge, (1998); Dean J.W.

While ratings have become ubiquitous and influential on the Internet, surprisingly little empirical research has investigated how these online assessments reflect the opinion of the population at large, especially in the domain of professional services where quality is often opaque to consumers. Building on the word-of mouth literature, we examine the relationship between online ratings and population perceptions of physician quality. We leverage a unique dataset which includes direct measures of both the offline population's perception of physician quality and consumer-generated online reviews. As a result, we are able to examine how online ratings reflect patients' opinions about physician quality. In sharp contrast to the widely voiced concerns by medical practitioners, we find that physicians who are rated lower in quality by the patient population are less likely to be rated online. Although ratings provided online are positively correlated with patient population opinions, the online ratings tend to be exaggerated at the upper end of the quality spectrum. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence of the relationship between online ratings and the underlying consumer-perceived quality, and extends prior research on online word-of-mouth to the domain of professional services.","In formativeness; Online ratings; Online word-of-mouth; Physician quality; Professional services","Management information systems; Empirical research; Medical practitioner; On-line assessment; Online ratings; Online word of mouths; Patient population; Perceptions of qualities; Professional services; Professional aspects","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Gao G., DesRoches C., Jha A.K., Research commentary - The digital transformation of healthcare: Current status and the road ahead, Information Systems Research, 21, 4, pp. 796-809, (2010); Alexander G.C., Casalino L.P., Tseng C.W., McFadden D., Meltzer D.O., Barriers to patient-physician communication about out-of-pocket costs, Journal of General Internal Medicine, 19, 8, pp. 856-860, (2004); Anderson C.L., Agarwal R., The digitization of healthcare: Boundary risks, emotion, and consumer willingness to disclose personal health information, Information Systems Research, 22, 3, pp. 469-490, (2011); Anderson E.W., Customer satisfaction and word of mouth, Journal of Service Research, 1, 1, pp. 5-17, (1998); Arndt J., Role of product-related conversations in the diffusion of a new product, Journal of Marketing Research, 4, 3, pp. 291-295, (1967); Arrow K. .

It is thought that many maintenance problems derive from inadequate software design and development practices. Poor design choices can result in complex software that is costly to support and difficult to change. However, it is difficult to assess the actual maintenance performance effects of software development practices because their impact is realized over the software life cycle. To estimate the impact of development activities in a more practical time frame, this research develops a two-stage model in which software complexity is a key intermediate variable that links design and development decisions to their downstream effects on software maintenance. The research analyzes data collected from a national mass merchandising retailer on 29 software enhancement projects and 23 software applications in a large IBM COBOL environment. Results indicate that the use of a code generator in development is associated with increased software complexity and software enhancement project effort. The use of packaged software is associated with decreased software complexity and software enhancement effort. These results suggest an important link between software development practices and maintenance performance.","Management of Computing and Information Systems; Software Complexity; Software Economics; Software Maintenance; Software Metrics; Software Productivity; Software Quality","COBOL (programming language); Costs; Management information systems; Computing and information systems management; Software complexity; Software economics; Software maintenance; Software metrics; Software productivity; Software quality; Software engineering","","","","","","","Albrecht A.J., Gaffney J., Software Function, Source Lines of Code, and Development Effort Prediction: A Software Science Validation, IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering, 6 SE-9, pp. 639-648, (1983); An American National Standard IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, (1983); Arthur L.J., Software Evolution, (1988); Banker R.D., Datar S., Kemerer C.F., Factors Affecting Software Maintenance Productivity: An Explanatory Study, Proc.

To address these contradictions, we investigate a holistic, configurational approach with the prevailing universalistic or contingency perspectives in exploring the effects of IT outsourcing strategies on outsourcing success. Based on residual rights theory, we begin by identifying three dimensions of IT outsourcing strategies: degree of integration, allocation of control, and performance period. We then develop a model of fit-as-gestalt, drawing from literatures on strategy, governance, interorganizational relationships, and outsourcing. Next, based on data from 311 firms in South Korea, we test universalistic and contingency perspectives in explaining the relationship between IT outsourcing strategies and outsourcing success. We then identify three congruent patterns, or gestalts, of IT outsourcing strategies. We term these strategies independent, arm's-length, and embedded strategies. To establish the predictive validity of these gestalts and the viability of a configurational perspective, we then explore the effects of these congruent gestalts vis-à-vis noncongruent patterns on three dimensions of outsourcing success: strategic competence, cost efficiency, and technology catalysis. We also contrast the effects of each of the three gestalts on each of the three dimensions of outsourcing success. Our findings indicate the superiority of the configurational approach over universalistic and contingency perspectives in explaining outsourcing success.","Arm's-length; Congruence; Embeddedness; Fit; IT outsourcing; Knowledge sharing; Outsourcing success; Partnership; Strategy","Computers; Economics; Finance; Information analysis; Management information systems; Outsourcing; Research; Societies and institutions; Arm's length; Congruence; Contingency; Embeddedness partnership; Fits; Information Technology (IT) success; Knowledge sharing; Strategy; Information technology","","","","","","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Altinkemer K., Chaturvedi A., Gulati R., Information systems outsourcing: Issues and evidence, Internat.

This integrative capability has important implications for large-scale information technology projects. This article examines the relationship between timely project completion and two dimensions of management's integrative capability: access to external knowledge and internal knowledge integration. Measures of these two dimensions are used to predict on-time project completion, where completion is a function of the duration of IT-related project delays. In a longitudinal study of 74 enterprise application integration projects in the medical sector, integrative capability was measured from the point of view of the CIO and a facility IT manager. Accounting for several project controls, our Cox regression results indicate both integrative dimensions significantly mitigate the duration of IT-related project delays, thus promoting timely project completion. The analysis also reveals the importance of taking management structure into consideration when studying IT phenomena in networked organizations.","Dynamic capabilities; Integrative capabilities; IT performance; Knowledge management; Management structure; MIS management; Project delay","Industrial management; Information technology; Management information systems; Product design; Societies and institutions; Knowledge management; Process design; Project management","","","","","","","Agresti A., Categorical Data Analysis, (1990); Altman R., Altman G., An Integration Primer, Business Integration Journal, pp. 57-59, (2004); Amit R., Schoemaker P., Strategic Assets and Organizational Rents, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Ancona D., Caldwell D., Bridging the Boundary, Administrative Science Quarterly, 37, 4, pp. 634-666, (1992); Ancona D., Caldwell D., Improving the Performance of New Product Teams, Research Technology Management, 33, 2, pp. 25-29, (1990); Appleyard M., Does Knowledge Flow?

Previous research examining other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) modules has shown that user perception of the responsiveness of such teams, as an indicator of a possible social exchange, is significantly associated with an increased favorable assessment of the new system and ultimately its adoption, the reason being that perceived responsiveness creates a constructive social exchange. However, previous research, using survey data alone, did not examine causation. The objective of this study is to examine, using a quasi-experimental design, whether different degrees of actual responsiveness in different sites during CRM implementation result in significant differences in the users' favorable assessment of the correctness and ultimately their approval of a new CRM. The data support these hypotheses, but show that the downstream effects of actual responsiveness are mediated by perceived responsiveness. Implications concerning the social exchange relationship during CRM adoption are discussed.","Customer Relationship Management; Enterprise Resource Planning; Social exchange theory","Customer satisfaction;

It is characterized by interorganizational coordination: companies working jointly with their customers and suppliers to integrate activities along the supply chain to effectively supply product to customers. More developed SCM is indicated by systematic integration, i.e. standardized and automatic interorganizational interfaces. Information technology (IT) engenders such systematic integration by allowing more efficient and automatic information flow. This research focuses on electronic data interchange (EDI), an important class of IT used for interorganizational information transfers in the supply chain. Data from a survey of the food industry is used to examine the use of EDI with respect to interfirm coordination activities involving suppliers and customers. The influence of demographic characteristics on EDI use is also investigated. The results suggest that firms view EDI as a tool for improving efficiencies rather than as a tool for facilitating supply chain integration. There is also a surprising difference in firms use of EDI with customers vis-à-vis suppliers. Firms tend to be much more accommodating of the desires of their customers than of their suppliers. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, United States","Although the choice of control mechanisms in systems development projects has been extensively studied in prior research, differences in such choices across internal and outsourced projects and their effects on systems development performance have not received much attention. This study attempts to address this gap using data on 57 outsourced and 79 internal projects in 136 organizations. Our results reveal a paradoxical overarching pattern: controllers attempt greater use of control mechanisms in outsourced projects relative to internal projects, yet controls enhance systems development performance in internal projects but not in outsourced projects. We introduce a distinction between attempted control and realized control to explain this disconnect, and show how anticipated transaction hazards motivate the former but meeting specific informational and social prerequisites facilitate the latter.Our results contribute three new insights to the systems development control literature. First, controllers attempt to use controller-driven control mechanisms to a greater degree in outsourced projects but controllee-driven control mechanisms to a greater degree in internal projects. Second, we establish a hitherto-missing control-performance link. The nuanced differences in internal and outsourced projects simultaneously confirm and refute a pervasive assertion in the information systems controls literature that control enhances performance. Finally, we show how requirements volatility-which can be at odds with control-alters the control-performance relationships. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2010 M.E.

However, user evaluations have been appropriately criticized as lacking a clearly articulated theoretical basis for linking them to systems effectiveness, and almost no research has been found that explicitly tests the link between user evaluations of systems and objectively measured performance. In this paper, we focus on user evaluations of task-technology fit for mandatory use systems and develop theoretical arguments for the link to individual performance. This is then empirically tested in a controlled experiment with objective performance measures and carefully validated user evaluations. Statistically significant support for the link is found for one measure of performance but not for a second. These findings are consistent with others which found that users are not necessarily accurate reporters of key constructs related to use of IS, specifically that self reporting is a poor measure of actual utilization. The possibility that user evaluations have a stronger link to performance when users receive feedback on their performance is proposed. Implications are discussed. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This typically entails substantial behavioral change by software developers away from previous informal practices toward conformance with the methodology. Developers' resistance to such change often results in failure to fully deploy and realize the benefits of the methodology. The present research draws upon theories of intention formation and innovation diffusion to advance knowledge about why developers accept or resist following methodologies. Results from a field study within a large organization indicate that developers' intentions are directly influenced by their perceptions of usefulness, social pressure, compatibility, and organizational mandate. This pattern of intention determinants is quite different from that typically observed in studies of information technology tool adoption, revealing several key differences between the domains of tool versus methodology adoption. Specifically, although organizational mandate had a significant effect on intentions, the strength of its direct influence was the lowest among the four significant constructs, and usefulness, compatibility, and social pressure all influenced intentions directly, above and beyond the effects of organizational mandate. The findings suggest, contrary to popular belief, that an organizational mandate is not sufficient to guarantee use of the methodology in a sustained manner.","Diffusion of innovations; Innovation adoption; Software development methodologies; Technology acceptance model","Computer software; Diffusion; Information technology; Societies and institutions; Innovation adoption; Management information systems","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Individual acceptance of information technologies, Framing the Domains of IT Management: Projecting the Future Through the Past, pp. 85-104, (2000); Agarwal R., Prasad J., The role of innovation characteristics and perceived voluntariness in the acceptance of information technologies, Decision Sciences, 28, 3, pp. 557-582, (1997); Agarwal R., Prasad J., A field study of the adoption of software process innovations by information systems professionals, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 47, 3, pp. 295-308, (2000); Ajzen I., Attitudes, Personality, and Behavior, (1988); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Andersen J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bagozzi R.P., Phillips L.W., Representing and testing organizational theories: A holistic construal, Administrative Science Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 459-489, (1982); Barki H., Hartwick J., Interpersonal conflict and its management in information system development, MIS Quarterly, 25, 2, pp. 195-228, (2001); Bayer J., Melone N., A critique of diffusion theory as a managerial framework for understanding adoption of software engineering innovations, Journal of Systems and Software, 9, 2, pp. 161-166, (1989); Brancheau J.C., Janz B.D., Wetherbe J.C., Key issues in information systems management: 1994-95 SIM Delphi results, MIS Quarterly, 20, 2, pp. 225-242, (1996); Chau P.Y.K., An empirical investigation on factors affecting the acceptance of CASE by systems developers, Information & Management, 30, 6, pp. 269-280, (1996); Chau P.Y.K., Hu P.J., Information technology acceptance by individual professionals: A model comparison approach, Decision Sciences, 32, 4, pp. 699-719, (2001); Chin W.W., Gopal A., Adoption intention in GSS: Relative importance of beliefs, DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, 26, 2-3, pp. 42-64, (1995); Chou C., Bentler P.M., Estimates and tests in structural equation modeling, Structural Equation Modeling: Concepts, Issues, and Applications, pp. 37-55, (1995); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R., Warshaw P., User acceptance of computer technology: A comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); DeShon R.P., A cautionary note on measurement error corrections in structural equation models, Psychological Methods, 3, 4, pp. 412-423, (1998); Dietrich G.B., Walz D.B., Wynekoop J.L., The failure of SDT diffusion: A case for mass customization, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44, 4, pp. 390-398, (1997); Ferratt T.W., Short L.E., Are information systems people different?

To investigate how GTM is applied in IS research and how the research contributions are contingent on those applications, we review 43 GTM-based articles in major IS and related journals. Ten of the articles develop theory. The other 33 articles use GTM to develop models and rich descriptions of new phenomena as their theoretical contribution. We show that each of the three forms is valuable to the IS community. For example, studies that develop theories and models are highly cited in the IS literature. We identify nine GTM procedures that are applied in various combinations to develop the three forms of research contribution. Treating GTM as a portfolio of the nine procedures, we examine the implications for the research contribution of adopting the core GTM procedures compared with a partial portfolio of those procedures. © 2017 The Authors.","Explorative; Grounded theory methodology; Portfolio approach; Procedures; Qualitative; Research method","Management information systems; Explorative; Grounded theory; Portfolio approach; Procedures; Qualitative; research methods; Information systems","","","","","","","Abraham C., Boudreau M.-C., Junglas I., Watson R., Enriching our theoretical repertoire: The role of evolutionary psychology in technology acceptance, European Journal of Information Systems, 22, 1, pp. 56-75, (2013); Agerfalk P.J., Insufficient theoretical contribution: A conclusive rationale for rejection?, European Journal of Information Systems, 23, 6, pp. 593-599, (2014); Avison D., Malaurent J., Is theory king?

Though prior studies have suggested that ""how much"" control is exercised has significant ramifications for individuals and firms, relatively few studies have operationalized and studied this important concept. In this study, we define the amount of formal control as the variety of mechanisms used by a client to exercise control over a vendor and the extent to which the mechanisms are used. We use literature on transaction cost economics and organizational control to build a model of the antecedents of the amount of formal control. The study uses data from 138 client-vendor matched pairs working in eight large, long-term, ongoing outsourcing arrangements to test specific hypotheses. The results suggest that clients who have technical or relationship management knowledge, or have high levels of trust in their vendors, use formal control mechanisms to a lesser extent. On the other hand, task uncertainty was found to be positively associated with the amount of formal control, and the degree of core competency involved in the outsourced activity was not found to be related to the amount of formal control. These results are discussed, and implications for research and practice are drawn. © 2008 INFORMS.","Client-vendor relationship; Control; Information systems management; Outsourcing","Control; Information management; Management information systems; Client-vendor relationships; Core competencies; Critical factors; Exercise control; Information technology outsourcing; Organizational controls; Relationship management; Transaction cost economics; Outsourcing","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Borys B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling and coercive, Admin.

This paper attempts to balance some of the arguments they raise from the marketing literature on the topic with the well-documented counterarguments of SERVQUAL's developers, as well as our own research evidence and observations in an IS-specific environment. Specifically, evidence is provided to show that the service quality perceptions-expectations subtraction in SERVQUAL is far more rigorously grounded than Van Dyke et al. suggest; that the expectations construct, while potentially ambiguous, is generally a vector in the case of an IS department; and that the dimensions of service quality seem to be as applicable to the IS department as to any other organizational setting. Then, the paper demonstrates that the problems of reliability of difference score calculations in SERVQUAL are not nearly as serious as Van Dyke et al. suggest; that while perceptions-only measurement of service quality might have marginally better predictive and convergent validity, this comes at considerable expense to managerial diagnostics; and reiterate some of the problems of dimensional instability found in our previous research, highlighted by Van Dyke et al. and discussed in many other studies of SERVQUAL across a range of settings. Finally, four areas for further research in this area are identified.","IS research agenda; Marketing of IS; Measurement; Reliability; Service quality; Validity","Behavioral research; Education; Evaluation; Marketing; Measurement theory; Research and development management; IS Research agenda; Marketing of IS; Service quality; Validity; Management information systems","","","","","","","Babakus E., Boiler G.W., An empirical assessment of the SERVQUAL scale, Journal of Business Research, 243, pp. 253-268, (1992); Baker G.P., Monsler K.B., San Francisco Bay Consulting, (1994); Van Dyke T.P., Kappelman L.A., Prybutok V.R., Measuring information Systems service quality: Concerns on the use of the SERVQUAL questionnaire, MIS Quarterly, 21, 2, pp. 195-208, (1997); Weick K.E., The Social Psychology of Organizing, (1979); Zeithaml V., Parasuraman A., Berry L.L., Delivering Quality Service: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations, (1990); Zeithaml V., Berry L.L., Parasuraman A., The nature and determinants of customer expectations of service quality, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 21, 1, pp. 1-12, (1993)","L.F.

It has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. Functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of ""subjective"" terms contained in text, i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. In this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms. The method is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of such terms, i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries, and on the use of the resulting term representations for semi-supervised term classification. The method we present outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard benchmarks for this task.

A citation analysis of IS articles that cite Hofstede's research on national culture suggests that most research is focused on issues related to IS management and to IS, while issues related to IS development and operations and to IS usage remain relatively unexamined. Within the dominant categories, research is concentrated in the IS management and types of information systems subcategories. Furthermore, the dimensions of national culture outlined by Hofstede have not been frequently used to develop and to build theory. Research opportunities and approaches to develop a stronger cumulative tradition and theory for international IS issues are proposed.","Citation analysis; Hofstede; Information systems (IS); National culture","Computer systems; Managers; Research; Societies and institutions; Citation analysis; Management information systems","","","","","","","King W.R., Sethi V., An empirical assessment of the organization of transnational information systems, J.

A proposed model provides a decision analysis capability that is often missing in existing CMMSs. The proposed model employs a hybrid of intelligent approaches. This hybrid system is analogous to the Holonic concept. The distinction between these two features is important. The rules function automatically. Practical implications. The main practical implication of this paper is the proposal of an intelligent model that can be linked to CMMSs to add value to data collected in the form of provision of decision support capabilities. A further implication is to identify the need for information to aid maintenance, followed by the provision of reasons for current deficiencies in existing off-the-shelf CMMSs.","Analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy logic; Maintenance programmes","Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Information analysis; Management information systems; Strategic planning; Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS); Manufacturing systems; Maintainability","","","","","","","Ben-Daya M., Duffuaa S.O., Raouf A., Maintenance Modelling and Optimisation, (2001); Bongaerts L., Monostori L., McFarlane D., Kadar B., Hierarchy in distributed shop floor control, Computers in Industry, 43, pp. 123-137, (2000); Boznos D., The Use of CMMSs to Support Team-based Maintenance, (1998); Christensen J., Holonic manufacturing systems-initial architecture and standards directions, Proceeding of the First European Conference on Holonic Manufacturing Systems, (1994); Exton T., Labib A.W., Spare parts decision analysis - The missing link in CMMSs (part II), Journal of Maintenance & Asset Management, 17, 1, pp. 14-21, (2002); Fernandez O., Labib A.W., Walmsley R., Petty D.J., A decision support maintenance management system: Development and implementation, International Journal of Quality and Reliability Management, 20, 8, pp. 965-979, (2003); Koestler A., The Ghost in the Machine, (1989); Labib A.W., An Interactive and Appropriate Productive Maintenance, (1996); Labib A.W., A logistic approach to managing the millennium information systems problem, Journal of Logistics Information Management, 11, 5, pp. 285-384, (1998); Labib A.W., World class maintenance using a computerised maintenance management system, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 4, 1, pp. 66-75, (1998); Labib A.W., Computerised maintenance management systems (CMMSs): A black hole or a black box?, Journal of Maintenance & Asset Management, 18, 3, pp. 16-21, (2003); Labib A.W., Exton T., Spare parts decision analysis - The missing link in CMMSs (Part I), Journal of Maintenance & Asset Management, 16, 3, pp. 10-17, (2001); Labib A.W., Cutting M.C., Williams G.B., Towards a world class maintenance programme, Proceedings of the CIRP International Symposium on Advanced Design and Manufacture in the Global Manufacturing Era, pp. 82-88, (1997); Labib A.W., Williams G.B., O'Connor R.F., An intelligent maintenance model (system): An application of the analytic hierarchy process and a fuzzy logic rule-based controller, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, pp. 745-757, (1998); Saaty T.L., The Analytic Hierarchy Process, (1980); Sherwin D., A review of overall models for maintenance management, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 6, 3, (2000); Shorrocks P., Selection of the Most Appropriate Maintenance Model Using a Decision Support Framework, (2000); Shorrocks P., Labib A.W., Towards a multimedia-based decision support system for word class maintenance, Proceedings of the 14th ARTS (Advances in Reliability Technology Symposium), (2000); Swanson L., Computerized Maintenance Management Systems: A Study of System Design and Use Production and Inventory Management Journal, 34, pp. 11-14, (1997)","","","","","","","","","13552511","","JQMEF","","English","J Qual Maint Eng","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-9444266436"

Owing to limited IT budgets and the need to justify investments in employee portals, assessing the benefits of these is an important field in research and practice. Thus, the purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of employee portal success. We introduce a theoretical model for this that is based on the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model. Furthermore, we develop hypotheses regarding the associations between different models' success dimensions and test them using more than 10,000 employees' responses collected in a survey of 22 companies. Our results indicate that besides the factors contributing to IS success in general, other success dimensions - like the quality of the collaboration and process support - have to be considered when aiming for a successful employee portal. The study's findings make it possible for practitioners to understand the levers with which to improve their employee portals. By empirically validating a comprehensive success model for employee portals, the study's results advance theoretical development in the area of collaboration-centered systems and present a basis for further research in this field. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Some organizations establish enterprise architecture (EA) standards to enable greater compatibility of information technology (IT) components and integration of applications and data across the enterprise. Through a firm-level survey, we sought to answer two key questions about the use of EA standards: (1) How do different governance mechanisms affect the use of EA standards? and (2) To what extent does the use of EA standards help organizations to improve the sharing and integration of IT resources across the enterprise? We identified four key governance mechanisms for EA standards management and examined how each mechanism affected the use of EA standards. We also examined how the use of EA standards affects the management of IT infrastructure, applications, and data resources across business units. Our empirical results showed that the use of EA standards is effective in helping organizations to better manage their IT resources. Our study also provides detailed insights into how organizations can set up governance mechanisms to facilitate the use of EA standards in achieving enterprise-wide goals. © 2007 M.E.

We view such rapid scaling as a generative process by which a venture's user base increases significantly between two points in time through digital innovation. We studied WeCash, a Chinese digital venture, nearly doubling its user base monthly, to learn more about this generative process. We trace three contingent mechanisms underpinning rapid scaling: data-driven operation, instant release, and swift transformation. We explain these mechanisms and how they interact in the rapid scaling of digital ventures. The research offers an agency perspective on scaling of digital ventures that speaks to the digital innovation literature.","Case study; Digital innovation; Digital technology; Digital ventures; Rapid scaling;

In a recent Decision Sciences article, Kettinger and Lee (1995) suggested the use of a modified SERVQUAL instrument to assess the quality of the services supplied by an information services provider. However, a number of problems with the SERVQUAL instrument are discussed in the literature. This article provides an illustrative example utilizing data collected from 138 executive and information systems professional customers of a multibillion dollar information services provider in order to examine the validity and reliability of Kettinger and Lee's (1995) modified SERVQUAL instrument. Results of analyses do not confirm the findings of Kettinger and Lee. Moreover, it appears that the use of difference scores in calculating SERVQUAL contributes to problems with the reliability, discriminant validity, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the measure. These findings suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of SERVQUAL scores and that further work is needed in the development of measures for assessing the quality of information services.","Management Information Systems; Quality Control; Service Operations; Service Quality","","","","","","","","Anderson J., Gerbing D., Predicting the performance of measures in a confirmatory factor analysis with a pretest assessment of their substantive validities, Journal of Applied Psychology, 76, 5, pp. 732-740, (1991); Babakus E., Boiler G.W., An empirical assessment of the SERVQUAL scale, Journal of Business Research, 24, 3, pp. 253-268, (1992); Bagozzi R.P., Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error: A comment, Journal of Marketing Research, 18, pp. 375-381, (1981); Boulding W., Kalra A., Staelin R., Zeithaml V.A., A dynamic process model of service quality: From expectations to behavioral intentions, Journal of Marketing Research, 30, 1, pp. 7-27, (1993); Brensinger R.P., Lambert D.M., Can the SERVQUAL scale be generalized to business-to-business services?

It is particularly challenging in institutionalized settings such as hospitals. We report an interpre-tive field study of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) at an acute-care hospital, in which we investigated how institutionally triggered and technology-triggered change interacted in complementary processes to engender alignment. Social structure changes included increased interdependency among clinical departments, multidisciplinary cooperation across clinical disciplines, and standardization in clinical decision-making. Organization members also enacted institutionalized interaction patterns with physicians by deferring to their preferences for CPOE use. The cumulative influence of change triggers nonetheless facilitated the hospital's realization of clinical goals. We drew on Barley's (1990) role- and network-based model for technology and structure alignment. Nonetheless, we extended this microlevel analytic approach to account for the influence of change in the macro-institutional environment. Our analysis clarified the extent of structure change attributable to the CPOE technology and highlighted institutional forces that promoted yet inhibited change. The case also highlighted the importance of role networks on the trajectory and outcomes of organizational change processes.","Computerized physician order entry; Health information technology; Institutional theory;

Therefore, health-care organizations are looking for new means to increase their functional capabilities and reduce integration cost. In addressing this need, enterprise application integration (EAI) technology has emerged to facilitate systems integration, enhance the quality of services, and reduce integration costs. Despite the application of EAI in other sectors, its adoption in health care is slow. In seeking to build on the limited normative research surrounding EAI, the authors of this paper focus on the evaluation of factors that influence EAI adoption in the health-care sector. In doing so, using fuzzy cognitive mapping as a technique to identify causal interrelationships among the EAI adoption factors. This approach will enhance the quality of the evaluation process and emphasizes the importance of each factor and its interrelationship with other factors. The outcomes shown in this paper will support health-care organizations' decision makers in exploring the implications surrounding EAI adoption. © 2006 M.E.

We integrate some of those knowledge-based approaches seeking to understand how aspects related to cross-functional orientation, new technologies, and increasing access to information affect manufacturing strategy. In this paper, ""know-what"" (where to find the needed information) and ""know-how"" (how to run operations smoothly) are considered key components of organizational knowledge in the process of manufacturing strategy formulation. Assuming that knowledge accumulation may lead to competitive advantage, we propose a model of manufacturing strategy process from a resource-based view perspective. We used a survey to collect field data from 104 companies. The results indicate that cross-functional activities integrate manufacturing knowledge and contribute to the creation of valuable and rare product characteristics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we examine the core ontological assumptions of CR in order to gain some perspective on key epistemological issues such as causation and validity, and illustrate how these shape our logic of inference in the research process through what is known as retroduction. We demonstrate the value of a CR-led mixedmethods research approach by drawing on a study that examines the impact of ICT adoption in the financial services sector. In doing so, we provide insight into the interplay between qualitative and quantitative methods and the particular value of applying mixed methods guided by CR methodological principles. Our positioning of demi-regularities within the process of retroduction contributes a distinctive development in this regard. We argue that such a research design enables us to better address issues of validity and the development of more robust meta-inferences.","Critical realism; Econometric modeling; IS research; Mixed methods; Qualitative and quantitative methods; Qualitative enquiry; Retroduction","Critical realisms; Econometric model; Is researches; Mixed method; Qualitative enquiry; Quantitative method; Retroduction; Management information systems","","","","","","","Aral S., Brynjolfsson E., Wu D.J., Which came first, it of productivity?

Yet several recent reviews have recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand, in this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both other items in the current order as well as future orders. We show how the findings can be used to provide input to inventory planning models and illustrate how failing to account for the long-run effects of a stockout will lead to suboptimal inventory decisions. We also demonstrate how the findings can be used in a customer lifetime value model. Finally, the study investigates the effectiveness of different responses that firms can offer to mitigate the cost of stockouts. There is considerable variation in the effectiveness of these responses. Offering discounts to encourage customers to backorder rather than cancel their orders is widely used in practice, but that was the least profitable of the responses that we evaluated. The findings have important implications for retailers considering the use of discounts as a response to stockouts. © 2006 INFORMS.","Inventory; Long run; Stockouts","Administrative data processing; Costs; Industrial economics; Industrial management; Management information systems; Strategic planning; Inventory planning; Long run; Stockouts; Inventory control","","","","","","","Anderson E., Simcstcr D., Docs promotion depth affect longrun demand?, Marketing Sci., 23, 1, pp. 4-20, (2004); Blattberg R.C., Neslin S.A., Sate Promotion: Concepts, Methods and Strategies, (1990); Campo K., Gijsbrechts E., Nisol P., The impact of retailer stockouts on whether, how much, and what to buy, Internat.

They may also implement group support systems (GSS) for the same reason. The two approaches can be taken separately or together. In this study, in-depth interviews with 37 practicing facilitators provided their perspectives on critical factors that influence meeting success and potential benefits and concerns with the use of GSS. Respondents focused on a core of communication and group process skills as critical for facilitator success. Overall, the respondents observed or anticipated more efficient and effective task performance as benefits of GSS technology. Their concerns focused on technology-related issues: participant anxiety, systems inflexibility, and systems reliability. Views of facilitators with high and low levels of GSS experience are largely consistent. High-experience GSS facilitators viewed technical issues as more central to meeting success, while low-experience GSS facilitators focused more heavily on attributes of the group. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for identifying and training GSS facilitators and comments on key issues of importance to GSS designers, based on the facilitator's perspective.","Electronic meetings; Group support systems","Communication systems; Computer science; Management information systems; Managers; Productivity; Public policy; Reliability; Societies and institutions; Electronic meetings; Flexibility; Group support systems (GSS); Technical presentations","","","","","","","Mintzberg H., The Nature of Managerial Work, (1973); Monge P.R., McSween C., Wyer J., A Profile of Meetings in Corporate America: Results of the 3M Meeting Effectiveness Study, (1989); Nunamaker J.F., Dennis A.R., George J.F., Valacich U.S., Vogel D.R., Electronic meeting systems to support group work: Theory and practice at arizona, Communications of the ACM, 34, 7, pp. 40-61, (1991)","F.

Reflecting on the management literature in the fields of knowledge management and performance management enabled the deduction of four basic assumptions, representing the links of a conceptual cause-and-effect framework - the knowledge value chain. Drawing on the resource-based view and the competence-based view of the firm, the paper identifies strategic, managerial, and operational dimensions of knowledge management. The review of performance management frameworks discusses the role of knowledge management in those models. These reflections allow linking knowledge management with core competencies, strategic processes, business performance, and finally, with value creation.","Intangible assets; Intellectual capital; Knowledge assets;

Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) information systems (IS), frequently a requirement for funding, are believed to inform the reporting process. The logical framework approach (LFA) is widely used throughout the aid industry for project design and appraisal, and although much of the literature also promotes the use of the LFA for the purposes of M&E, it has proved inadequate. This article reviews the key limitations of the conventional LFA for M&E and proposes an extension to the LFA matrix (the ""logframe"") in order to facilitate its application beyond the design phase. This is achieved by adding a time dimension, more precisely defining the elements of the project MIS, and integrating other project management tools. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA.

This study investigates why technical support analysts seek out and access knowledge from these repositories, as opposed to more traditional sources of such knowledge - colleagues and manuals. Focusing on the demand for - rather than supply of - knowledge in organizations, our research elaborates the role played by analysts' learning orientation, perceived work demands, and risk aversion in predicting their knowledge sourcing behavior. Our results include several counterintuitive findings that suggest there is not very much learning going on via technical support knowledge repositories. Analysts seem to be focused on finding recipes for solving customers' problems rather than building a better understanding of the products they support. Implications for research and practice highlight the need for more effective technologies to speed searches, the utility of a formal and visible mechanism for validating knowledge, and the inherent tension between efficiency and learning in these environments. © 2006 M.E.

This paper analyzes knowledge production in design-science research to explain how an endogenous form of pluralism characterizes such studies, making it problematic to associate any designscience study with a single view of knowledge production. Instead, a design-science research study exhibits up to four different modes of reasoning, called genres of inquiry. These genres are derived from two dualities that contrast differing knowledge goals and differing knowledge scope in the knowledge production process. The first duality arises from the sometimes seemingly contradictory knowledge goals of science versus design. The second duality reflects the contradiction between the scope of the knowledge produced, which may be idiographic or nomothetic. The evolutionary and iterative nature of a design-science study compels different knowledge goals and scope at different moments throughout a project. Because of this momentary nature, a single design-science study can be associated with multiple genres of inquiry. This understanding of the variety in the genres of inquiry advances the discourse on the nature of design-science research and the justification and evaluation of its outcomes. Consequently, a corresponding set of criteria for knowledge justification and evaluation is provided for each genre of inquiry.","Centrality of knowledge; Design science research; Duality; Endogenous pluralism;

Specific attention has recently been paid to digital social movement organizing and action repertoire development. The literature acknowledges the changing face of activism at the movement level, but little is known about the relationship between social movement organizations (SMOs) and digital action repertoires. Understanding this relationship is critical because strong adherence to values is at the heart of establishing action repertoires with legitimacy and persistence. In this paper, we rely on a two-year longitudinal study of the Swedish affiliate of Amnesty International. We examine the transformation in engagement and interaction that followed the organization's introduction of new action repertoires. Drawing on resource mobilization theory and the collective action space model, we elaborate how new action repertoires both stabilized and challenged the values of the SMO, as well as gradually broadened the interactions of supporters and deepened their modes of engagement. We offer a value-based model on the antecedents and effects of new action repertoires from the SMO perspective. The empirical findings and the model build new theory on social media and digital activism at the organizational level, complementing the predominant movement level research in the extant literature.","Case study; Collaboration; Digital activism; Networks and communities; Organization; Societal change","Management information systems; Societies and institutions; Amnesty internationals; Collaboration; Digital activism; Longitudinal study; Organizational levels; Resource mobilization theory; Societal changes; Value-based models; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Agarwal S.D., Barthel M.L., Rost C., Borning A., Bennett W.L., Johnson C.N., Grassroots organizing in the digital age: Considering values and technology in tea party and occupy wall street, Information, Communication & Society, 17, 3, pp. 326-341, (2014); Alimi E.Y., Hirsch-Hoefler S., Structure of political opportunities and threats, and movement-countermovement interaction in segmented composite regimes, Comparative Politics, 44, 3, pp. 331-349, (2012); Alvesson M., Skoldberg K., Reflexive Methodology: New Vistas for Qualitative Research, (2009); Bennett W.L., Segerberg A., Digital media and the personalization of collective action: Social technology and the organization of protests against the global economic crisis, Information, Communication & Society, 14, 6, pp. 770-799, (2011); Blau P.M., Scott W.R., Formal Organizations: A Comparative Approach, (1962); Bimber B., Flanagin A., Stohl C., Collective Action in Organizationsm, (2012); Chadwick A., Digital network repertoires and organizational hybridity, Political Communication, 24, 3, pp. 283-301, (2007); Charmaz K., Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis, (2006); Choi S., Park H.W., An exploratory approach to a twitter-based community centered on a political goal in South Korea: Who organized it, what they shared, and how they acted, New Media & Society, 16, 1, pp. 129-148, (2013); Clemens E.S., Minkoff D.C., Beyond the iron law: Rethinking the place of organizations in social movement research, The Blackwell Companion to Social Movements, pp. 155-170, (2004); Edmondson A.C., McManus S.E., Methodological fit in management field research, Academy of Management Review, 32, 4, pp. 1246-1264, (2007); Flanagin A.J., Stohl C., Bimber B., Modeling the structure of collective action, Communication Monographs, 73, 1, pp. 29-54, (2000); Gamson W.A., Meyer D.S., Framing Political Opportunity, Comparative Perspectives on Social Movements: Political Opportunities, Mobilizing Structures, and Cultural Framings, pp. 275-290, (1996); Garrett R., Protest in an information society: A review of literature on social movements and New ICTs, Information, Communication & Society, 9, 2, pp. 202-224, (2006); Ghobadi S., Clegg S., These days will never bne forgotten⋯: A critical mass approach to online activism, Information and Organization, 25, 1, pp. 52-71, (2015); Gil De Zuniga H., Jung N., Valenzuela S., Social media use for news and individuals' social capital, civic engagement and political participation, Journal of Computer- Mediated Communication, 17, 3, pp. 319-336, (2012); Glaser B.S., Strauss A.A., The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967); Harlow S., Social media and social movements: Facebook and an online guatemalan justice movement that moved offline, New Media & Society, 14, 2, pp. 225-243, (2012); Jenkins J.C., Resource mobilization theory and the study of social movements, Annual Review of Sociology, 9, pp. 527-553, (1983); Kane G.C., Alavi M., Labianca G., Borgatti S.P., What's different about social media networks?

An analysis of data that measure hundreds of electronic commerce transactions along with data at the firm level shows that higher shipping and handling charges are good indicators of better PDS quality. Other transaction-level conditions and firm-level attributes also affect PDS quality, as measured by availability, timeliness, and reliability. Most notably, when the net price of products transacted increases, PDS reliability and availability decline. Furthermore, Internet-retailer size is found to favor PDS availability whereas, surprisingly, newer Internet retailers exhibit a higher level of PDS availability than many of their incumbent competitors. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Although IFTUsheds light on the four mechanisms underlying technology use, it lacks a coherent theoretical explanation for the underlyingforce that leads to the four mechanisms. To offer a more generalized and richer description of the four mechanisms, this study extends IFTU by drawing on the process model of memory in cognitive psychology. In addition, based on the extended IFTUparadigm, a three-wave panel model is developed that incorporates not only proximal effects but also distal effects of the four mechanisms on post-adoption phenomena. Three different sets of data (n = 195, 160, and 342, respectively) are used to test the proposed model. The results of data analysis show that, as expected, the four mechanisms have proximal effects on subsequent evaluations and behavior. Furthermore, consistent with the memory perspective, the sequential updating and habit mechanisms are found to have distal effects on post-adoption phenomena even after controlling for their proximal effects. Overall, the findings ofthis study indicate that the memory perspective offers not only a seamless explanation of the four mechanisms underlying technology use but also yields deeper insights that can be validated only through a three-or-more-wave panel study. This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating that the extended IFTU paradigm has the potential to serve as a coherent theoreticalframework on post-adoption phenomena in which prior experiences are internalized into memories, which in turn regulate later experiences.","Continued use; Longitudinal study; Panel model; Path analysis; Process model of memory; Technology use; Theory of planned behavior (tpb)","Management information systems; Continued use; Longitudinal study; Panel model; Path analysis; Process Modeling; Technology use; Theory of Planned Behavior; Regression analysis","","","","","","","Aarts H., Dijksterhuis A., Habits as knowledge structures: Automaticity in goal-directed behavior, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, 1, pp. 53-63, (2000); Ahuja M.K., Thatcher J.B., Moving beyond intentions and toward the theory of trying: effects of work environment and gender on post-adoption information technology use, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 427-459, (2005); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Residual Effects of Past on Later Behavior: Habituation and Reasoned Action Perspectives, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6, 2, pp. 107-122, (2002); Alba J.W., Hutchinson J.W., Dimensions of consumer expertise, Journal of Consumer Research, 13, 4, pp. 411-454, (1987); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Anderson J.R., Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications, (1990); Atkins R.C., Schiffrin R.M., Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes, The Psychology of Learning and Motivation: Advances in Research and Theory, 2, pp. 89-195, (1968); Babin B.J., Babin L., Seeking something different?

Because the bulk of requirements determination occurs early in the development of a system, improvements can yield significant benefits for the entire systems development process. This paper first discusses a three-stage descriptive model of the requirements determination process. Four classes of difficulties in determining systems requirements are then used to organize and describe particular problems that occur within each stage of the process, together with the cognitive and behavioral theories that underlie them. The paper then describes techniques that can address the problems and presents theoretical considerations that analysts can use in applying the techniques to improve requirements determination. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It will be proven that the adoption of EDI by the supplier can result in the positive externalities for the buyer and negative externalities for the other suppliers. It will also be shown that although EDI reduces the transaction costs of the buyer, the upstream market tends to become more concentrated as a result of the increased cost differentials.","","Competition; Costs; Economic and social effects; Information technology; Management information systems; Marketing; Public policy; Standardization; Strategic planning; Competitive externalities; Electronic data interchange; Implementation policy; Interorganizational information systems; Data communication systems","","","","","","","","","","Inst of Management Sciences","","","","","","00251909","","MSCIA","","English","Manage Sci","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029275247"

However, there are very few empirical and theoretical studies on the factors that influence performance measurement practices in SMEs. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap using both theoretical and empirical approaches. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review and interviews were used to identify four key contingency factors for PMS in SMEs. A qualitative research design involving a multiple case study methodology was carried out to investigate how these factors influence performance measurement. Findings - The relationship between the contingency factors and performance measurement were formalized in four theoretical propositions. First corporate governance structure is one of the main factors influencing performance measurement adoption and use. Second, advanced information practices and advanced behaviours on the part of the people involved appear to be a necessary condition for the effective implementation and use of PMS in SMEs. Third, a change in a firm's business model seems to lead to the development of an improved PMS. Finally, the successful implementation of a PMS seems to be driven by an authoritative management style. Research limitations/implications - Contingency factors were studied independently. Future research might investigate how these factors collectively influence performance measurement practices to make interdependence more explicit. Practical implications - The theoretical propositions provide useful knowledge for defining a methodology and managerial tool to support performance measurement in SMEs. Originality/value - This paper defines key contingency factors influencing performance measurement in SMEs; it contributes to clarifying how these factors could influence performance measurement practices in companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate governance;

However, strategic investments usually have an element of risk linked to uncertain and deferred investment benefits. To date, such investment decisions relating to knowledge workers have not been extensively researched. In this paper, we explore the following research question: How do we strategically assess knowledge creation over time giving consideration to complex decision criteria in order to improve organizational value? We develop a model based on economic and organization theory for assessing organizational value with regard to knowledge creation investments. Our model prototype provides managers with a learning tool relating to the timing and selection of knowledge creation investments. Our own use of the tool in simulation experiments yielded several insights which suggest that the decisions typically made by managers may dilute knowledge creation investments. Our results demonstrate that the organizational benefit of knowledge creation processes should be well aligned with near-term tasks. Under instances of high knowledge depreciation, however, it is unlikely that individual workers can optimize knowledge creation process decisions without organizational involvement in matching skills to task complexities. The organizational benefits of consistent and frequent knowledge creation process participation increase over time as the match of skills and task complexities improve.","Economic theory; Knowledge creation;

One of the central effects of this trust in the context of IT adoption is to increase the perceived usefulness (PU) of Information Technology (IT) associated with the trustee's agency. One way of increasing this trust is through greater sociocultural similarity. Taking previous research into the realm of electronic voting, this paper posits that because trust is culture-dependent, it should decrease considerably as cultural diversity and differentiation increases. To investigate the role of trust in IT adoption in different cultures where dissimilar concepts of socially acceptable behavior exist, this study compares trust-related perceptions of an emerging IT (i.e., electronic voting) between the United States of America (USA) and the Republic of South Africa (RSA). More specifically, the question was addressed by comparing the unique circumstances of the cultural changes in the RSA with the more socially integrated mainstream USA culture. In both cultures, a perceived sociocultural similarity between the individual and the agency in charge of the electronic voting IT contributed to both the establishment of trust and to an increase in the perceived usefulness of the IT, supporting and extending the extrapolations of past propositions to this new realm. However, only in the USA did trust contribute to the PU of the IT. The results suggest that when cultural diversity is large, trust becomes of lesser importance, perhaps because it can no longer reduce social uncertainty. Implications for researchers and governmental voting agencies are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.","Citizen access; Individual rights; Internet policy; Internet trust; IS project planning;

In this paper, we advance a framework for supporting management decision-making about customization choices and the capabilities required to accomplish them. In this framework, we identify various customization possibilities for business processes as well as ERP systems. We also identify technical and process change capabilities required for system and process customization. Combining customization options with change capabilities, we present a useful way for managers to identify feasible customization options for their particular organization. Such a framework also helps managers to recognize the gap between desired customization options and change capabilities. case study is used to illustrate the application of the framework. © 2004 IEEE.","","Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision making; Information technology; Management information systems; Requirements engineering; Systems engineering; Change capability; Customization choices; Process customization; System customization; Enterprise resource planning","","","","","","","AMR Research Predicts Enterprise Applications Market Will Reach $70 Billion in 2006, (2002); Brown C., Vessey I., ERP implementation approaches: Toward a contingency framework, Proc. 20th Int.

Much of the prior information systems literature has assumed an underlying relationship between ""facilitating conditions"" for information technology (IT) adoption (e.g., user training, technical support, resource availability) and employees' technology use. Although these facilitating conditions are important, they do not provide a complete explanation of employees' IT usage. The reality of working in organizational settings suggests a different model of IT adoption and usage. Drawing from research on social information processing theory, and acknowledging the role of other individuals within the work context that shapes employees' learning, values, and behavior, we propose a framework to explain employees' adoption of IT and their level of usage within organizations, featuring both individual-level factors and factors related to the social information processing influence of co-workers. Our results show that an employee's coworkers exert an important influence on IT usage, whereas individual-level factors exhibit more modest effects. © 2005 M.E.

Second, do media-related perceptions remain static or change as they are used over time? And finally, do media differences result in performance differences, i.e., do richer media result in better performance for equivocal tasks as predicted by bandwidth theories? Some results of this study tend to support media-characteristics theories while others offer limited support for more evolutionary perspectives. For instance, initially, face-to-face groups found their medium to be warmer, have a better interface, and be more effective compared to their distributed counterparts. While many of these initial perceptions lingered over time, there was one notable exception. At the start of the study, face-to-face groups rated their medium as being more effective than synchronous groups; however, by the end of the study, no significant differences were apparent. Moreover, despite the persistently lower social presence of leaner media, distributed-synchronous groups performed better than their face-to-face counterparts. Finally, the two types of distributed groups - synchronous and asynchronous - did not differ significantly in their perceptions or performance. This study improves our understanding of distributed interaction while simultaneously highlighting the need to further investigate the relationships among tasks, technologies and teams over time.","Communication media; Computer-mediated communication; Group perceptions; Group performance; Longitudinal research strategies","Bandwidth; Communication systems; Computer supported cooperative work; Interfaces (computer); Performance; Societies and institutions; Technical presentations; Communication media; Computer-mediated communication; Group performance; Group preceptions; Longitudinal research strategies; Management information systems","","","","","","","Ebel R.L., Estimation of the reliability of ratings, Psychometrika, 16, 4, pp. 407-424, (1951); Fisher B.A., Ellis D.G., Small Group Decision Making: Communication and the Group Process, 3rd Ed., (1990); Gersick C.J.G., Marking time: Predictable transitions in task groups, Academy of Management Journal, 32, 2, pp. 274-309, (1989); Horst P., A generalized expression for the reliability of measures, Psychometrika, 14, 1, pp. 21-31, (1949); Kantorowitz E., Sudarsky O., The adaptable user interface, Communications of the ACM, 32, 11, pp. 1352-1358, (1989); Kinney S., Dennis A., Re-evaluating media richness: Cues, feedback, and task, Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 21-30, (1994); Lea M., Rationalist assumptions in cross-media comparisons of computer-mediated communication, Behaviour and Information Technology, 10, 2, pp. 153-172, (1991); Markus M.L., Electronic mail as the medium of managerial choice, Organization Science, 5, 4, pp. 502-527, (1994); McGrath J.E., Time, Interaction and Performance (TIP): A theory of groups, Small Group Research, 22, 2, pp. 147-174, (1991); Miranda S., Cohesion and Conflict Management in Group Decision Support Systems, (1990); Rice R.E., Love G., Electronic emotion: Socio-emotional content in a computer-mediated communication network, Communication Research, 14, 1, pp. 85-108, (1987); Short J., Williams E., Christie B., The Social Psychology of Telecommunications, (1976); Sproull L., Kiesler S., Reducing social context cues: Electronic mail in organizational communication, Management Science, 32, 11, pp. 1492-1512, (1986); Trevino L.K., Daft R., Lengel R.H., Understanding managers' media choices: A symbolic interactionist perspective, Organizations and Communication Technology, pp. 71-94, (1990); Valacich J.S., Mennecke B.E., Wachter R., Wheeler B.C., Extensions to media richness theory: A test of the task-media fit hypothesis, Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 11-20, (1994); Walther J.B., Interpersonal effects in computer mediated communication: A relational perspective, Communication Research, 19, 1, pp. 52-90, (1992); Walther J.B., Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, interpersonal and hyperpersonal interaction, Communication Research, 23, 1, pp. 3-43, (1996); Walther J.B., Tidwell L.C., Nonverbal cues in computer-mediated communication, and the effect of chronemics on relational communication, Journal of Organizational Computing, 5, 4, pp. 355-378, (1995)","K.

Conversely, IT consumerization refers to the process whereby the changing practices and expectations of consumers influence the IT-related activities of workers and managers in organizations. We propose that IT consumerization not only challenges the foundations of IT governance but ultimately also transforms it. To explore this research problem, we utilize the punctuated equilibrium theory and a case study of IT consumerization and the transformation of IT governance in a large global bank. Our findings suggest that the widespread adoption of digital technology in everyday life leads to ""everyone's IT,"" which is a new set of shared beliefs among consumers that highlights democratized access and individualized use of IT. As everyone's IT beliefs begin to alter the IT-related activities of workers, the result is IT governance misalignments that ultimately lead to a punctuated transformation of IT governance that dismantles functional IT governance. The establishment of platform-based governance marks a new equilibrium period. Our mid-range theory contributes to the IS domain with the novel concept of everyone's IT and a grounded explanation of IT governance transformation in the context of IT consumerization. Our theory offers a set of significant research and practical implications.

Although this issue has received significant attention in recent years, empirical research focusing specifically on it is still relatively sparse. Here, BP-ISP integration is considered in four ways (administrative, sequential, reciprocal, and full integration), reflecting various degrees of BP-ISP integration. The relationships between these and organizational impact (measured in terms of the extent of ISP problems and the extent of IS contributions to organizational performance) are investigated through the analysis of data gathered in a ""matched pair"" field survey of business planners and IS executives. The results empirically validate the importance of BP-ISP integration, since it was found to have a significant positive relationship with IS contributions to organization performance and a significant negative relationship to the extent of ISP problems.","Alignment;

In such a supply chain the initial production or key material procurement decision has to be made when there is limited information about the market demand. When it is the time for the final production and/or shipment decision, more accurate demand information is available, which allows the modification of the initial decision so that some costs can be saved. We consider a two-stage supply chain in which the manufacturer decides the initial production quantity in the first stage, and the retailer specifies her order quantity in the second stage after the demand forecast is improved. In this setting, the conventional return mechanism needs to be modified to coordinate the supply chain. We propose a risk sharing contract that requests the retailer to partially compensate for the manufacturer's loss that is attributable to the overproduction in the first stage, and the manufacturer to provide a partial credit for the retailer's loss that results from overstocking in the second stage. Such a contract not only extracts the maximal supply-chain profit, but can also improve the profit of each supply-chain member by tuning the contract parameters. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, 30303, GA, United States","Information systems (IS) use, the dominant theoretical paradigm for explaining how users apply IS artifacts toward goal attainment, gives primacy to human agency in the user-IS artifact relationship. Models and theorizing in the IS use research stream tend to treat the IS artifact as a passive tool; lacking in the ability to initiate action and accept rights and responsibilities for achieving optimal outcomes under uncertainty. We argue that a new generation of ""agentic"" IS artifacts requires revisiting the human agency primacy assumption. Agentic IS artifacts are no longer passive tools waiting to be used, are no longer always subordinate to the human agent, and can now assume responsibility for tasks with ambiguous requirements and for seeking optimal outcomes under uncertainty. To move our theorizing forward, we introduce delegation, based on agent interaction theories, as a foundational and powerful lens through which to understand and explain the human- agentic IS artifact relationship. While delegation has always been central to human-IS artifact interactions, it has yet to be explicitly recognized in IS use theorizing. We explicitly theorize IS delegation by developing an IS delegation theoretical framework. This framework provides a scaffolding which can guide future IS delegation theorizing and focuses on the human-agentic IS artifact dyad as the elemental unit of analysis. The framework specifically reveals the importance of agent attributes relevant to delegation (endowments, preferences, and roles) as well as foundational mechanisms of delegation (appraisal, distribution, and coordination). Guidelines are proposed to demonstrate how this theoretical framework can be applied toward generation of testable models. We conclude by outlining a roadmap for mobilizing future research. © 2021 University of Minnesota.

This paper builds on a belief that for the field to move forward and have an impact on practitioners and other academic fields, the existing work must be examined and systematized. It is particularly important to systematize research on the factors that underlie success of organizational IS. The goal here is to conceptualize the IS success antecedents (ISSA) area of research through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating the work in the domain. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, a taxonomy of 12 general categories is created, and existing research within each category is examined. Important lacunae in the direction of work have been determined. It is found that little work has been conducted on the macro-level independent variables, the most difficult variables to assess, although these variables may be the most important to understanding the ultimate value of IS to organizations. Similarly, ISSA research on success variables of consequence to organizations was found severely lacking. Variable analysis research on organizational-level success variables was found to be literally nonexistent in the IS field, whereas research in the organizational studies field was found to provide useful directions for IS researchers. The specifics of the 12 taxonomy areas are analyzed and directions for research in each of them provided. Thus, researchers and practitioners are directed toward available research and receive suggestions for future work to bring ISSA research toward an organized and cohesive future.","Antecedents of success;

Infomediaries offer matching services that facilitate establishment of a buyer-seller agreement, and value-added services that either provide a standalone benefit or enhance benefits from matching services. This paper develops and analyzes economic models of intermediaries to examine their pricing and product line design strategies. Intermediaries provide aggregation benefits: Buyers find an intermediary's service more valuable if it provides access to more sellers, and sellers value it more if it provides access to more buyers, but also when they compete with fewer sellers. Due to this unique combination of network effects, we find that an intermediary has stronger incentives to provide quality-differentiated versions of its service relative to other information goods sellers. When buyers have constant marginal valuations for service quality, the intermediary should offer only two levels of service. While it is optimal for the intermediary to offer two levels of service, increasing the quality of the low-level service reduces the intermediary's profits due to increased cannibalization of the premium service. Hence, the optimal menu consists of a basic matching service and a premium service that includes matching and value-added services.

Fast response and personalized recommendations have become natural trends for all businesses. This is particularly important for content-related products and services, such as consulting, news, and knowledge management in an organization. The digital nature of their products allows for more customized delivery over the Internet. To provide personalized services, however, a complete understanding of user profile and accurate recommendation are essential. In this paper, an Internet recommendation system that allows customized content to be suggested based on the user's browsing profile is developed. The method adopts a semantic-expansion approach to build the user profile by analyzing documents previously read by the person. Once the customer profile is constructed, personalized contents can be provided by the system. An empirical study using master theses in the National Central library in Taiwan shows that the semantic-expansion approach outperforms the traditional keyword approach in catching user interests. The proper usage of this technology can increase customer satisfaction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These technologies began as instrumental aids to support office work of individuals but have since also become the basis for social interactions and community building in organisations and more recently become able to perform managerial roles with the use of advanced AI capabilities. Our call for papers to this special issue invited original studies to go further and advance our thinking on the strategic implications of this layered evolution of workplace technologies on work and the structure of organisations. In this introduction, we synthesise the main themes from the special issue, and also ongoing dialogues with the growing community at the regular AIS / IFIP 9.1 workshop on the Changing Nature of Work. A key observation is that the work involved in configuring emergent Digital/Human configurations, is vastly under-reported and poorly understood. Paradoxically, this configuring work is the most demanding and critical in the shaping of modern organisations. We suggest that this type of largely invisible work requires engagement beyond the level of execution or even the meaning of work, it requires intervening with third order effects that get to the core of what an organisation is. We highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require more dynamic and supple responses based on the values, purpose and intent dominant in the organisation – we describe this as structural digital work. Leaders that are unable or unwilling to engage with effects at this level, and this type of work, will miss identifying core opportunities and risks associated with digital transformation in organisations. We also reflect on the value of current theories and methods used to research this important and emergent phenomenon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Changing nature of work; Digital transformation; Digital work; Digital/Human configurations; New ways of working; Organisational transformation","Information systems; Management information systems; Community buildings; Current theories; Digital transformation; Emergent phenomenon; Frames of reference; Organisational transformations; Social interactions; Third-order effects; Automatic identification","","","","","","","Aral S., Dellarocas C., Godes D., Social media and business transformation: a framework for research, Inform.

While there is little question that clients should learn, there is less clarity about how best to facilitate client learning during developer-client meetings. In this study, we suggest that a cooperative learning strategy called collaborative elaboration developed by educational psychologists provides a theoretical and practical basis for stimulating client learning during an IS design process. The problem with assessing the effects of collaborative elaboration, however, is in controlling for the many other factors that might affect client learning and outcomes of an IS design phase. In a unique research opportunity, we were able to measure the use of collaborative elaboration among 85 developers and clients involved in 17 projects over a semester-long IS design process. The projects were homogeneous with respect to key contextual variables. Our PLS analysis suggested that teams using more collaborative elaboration had more client learning and teams with more client learning achieved better IS design-phase outcomes. This suggests that theories about collaborative elaboration have significant potential for helping IS researchers identify new approaches for stimulating client learning early in the IS design process.","Client-developer dialogue;

However, instituting clan control in such conditions is challenging as people come to a project with diverse skills and backgrounds. There is often insufficient time for clan control to develop naturally. This paper investigates the question, ""How can clan control be enacted in complex IT projects?"" Recognizing social capital as a resource, we conceptualize a clan as a group with strong social capital (i.e., where its members have developed their structural, cognitive, and relational ties to the point that they share common values and beliefs and are committed to a set of peer norms). We theorize that the enactment of clan control is a dual process of (1) building the clan by developing its social capital dimensions (structural, cognitive, and relational ties) or reappropriating social capital from elsewhere and (2) leveraging the clan by reinforcing project-facilitating shared values, beliefs, and norms, and inhibiting those that impede the achievement of project goals. We explore how clan control was enacted in a large IT project at a major logistics organization in which clan control was quickly instituted to avoid an impending project failure. Our research contributes to theory in three ways: (1) we reconcile the two differing views of clan control into a single framework, (2) we explain the role of controllers in enacting clan control, and (3) we clarify how formal control can be employed to develop clan control.","Behavioral control theory; Clan control; Enterprise systems; Formal control; IT projects; Project control; Project management; Social capital","Management information systems; Behavioral control theories; Clan controls; Enterprise system; Formal controls; IT project; Project control; Social capitals; Project management","","","","","","","Adler P.A., Adler P., Intense loyalty in organizations: A case study of college athletes, Administrative Science Quarterly, 33, 3, pp. 401-417, (1988); Adler P.S., Borys B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling and coercive, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, 1, pp. 61-89, (1996); Adler P.S., Kwon S.-W., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept, Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Arnott R., Stiglitz J.E., Moral hazard and nonmarket institutions: Dysfunctional crowding out of peer monitoring?, American Economic Review, 81, 1, pp. 179-190, (1991); Arregle J.-L., Hitt M.A., Sirmon D.G., Very P., The development of organizational social capital: Attributes of family firms, Journal of Management Studies, 44, 1, pp. 73-93, (2007); Barron J.M., Gjerde K.P., Peer pressure in an agency relationship, Journal of Labor Economics, 15, 2, pp. 234-254, (1997); Bicchieri C., The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms, (2006); Bolino M.C., Turnley W.H., Bloodgood J.M., Citizenship behavior and the creation of social capital in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 27, 4, pp. 505-522, (2002); Boss R.W., Is the leader really necessary?

The dominant perspective of programme management is essentially project-based, tending to view programme management as an extension of project management. The most comprehensive and widely used programme management framework in the UK, Managing Successful Programmes, is published and used by the Office of Government Commerce, and purports to be pragmatic guidance in the form of key principles and techniques. This paper describes research on the actual practices used on programmes in commercial and UK public sector organisations. Using Managing Successful Programmes as a template for the data collection and analysis, we studied six programmes. Even in cases where Managing Successful Programmes was the mandated approach, the processes and techniques were not consistently applied, rather elements of the framework were selectively chosen and adapted. The research revealed significant and on-going crafting of programme content, structures and processes to reconcile divergent aims and interests, to expedite progress in the face of adversity and to engage multiple sponsors, contributors and stakeholders. The research highlighted the importance and influence of context, namely the dynamic cultural, political and business environment in which the programmes operate, and the organisationally embedded nature of programme management. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Context; MSP; Practices; Programme management","Data reduction; Information science; empirical analysis; management practice; project management; research; Context; Programme management; Management information systems","","","","","Home Office","Also many of these projects are mainly pilot projects funded by the Home Office.

Although much studied, variation in patterns of discretionary use has yet to be explained adequately in terms of an accepted integrative theory validated across varieties of channel types and organizational settings. In a step toward the development of such a theory, the present paper proposes a basic channel‐disposition model that relates an individual's attitude or disposition toward a channel to his/her actual use of the channel in the context of information and channel supply‐and‐demand structures in the organization. An exploratory study of the dispositions of 186 users of ten management information system (MIS) reports in four organizational settings provides limited evidence in support of the model proposed.

We explored these questions through a two-year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work. Drawing on a human–machine configuration perspective, we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis. In contrast to replacing human work, the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human-in-the-loop pattern, comprised of both the augmentation work of auditing (i.e. the generation of a ground truth and assessment of the algorithmic output against this) as well as the work of altering the algorithm and the data acquisition architecture. Our research points to the strategic importance of a human-in-the-loop pattern for organizational reflexivity to ensure that the performance of the algorithm meets the organization's requirements and changes in the environment. © 2020 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence (AI); Augmentation; Automation; Digital work; Human-in-the-loop; Human–machine configurations","Information systems; Management information systems; Algorithmic analysis; Data acquisition architecture; Ground truth; Human-in-the-loop; Data acquisition","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd","This work was financially supported by The Research Council of Norway and Iserv Computing , a Norwegian software company.

However, offering training programs and enabling access to facilities are not sufficient on their own if, due to other reasons, the socially disadvantaged groups do not choose to make use of the facilities. As an exploratory investigation, this study focuses on the voluntary adoption of these facilities (typified by the Internet) by one such disadvantaged group - older adults. In particular, this study investigates the role of Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations in older adults' usage of the Internet through a three-part longitudinal study, involving almost 1,000 participants. A theoretical model based on social cognitive theory was developed and empirically tested through both surveys and lab experiments. Behavioral modeling training courses were offered to adults age 55 or older in the study over a one-year period. Questionnaire surveys and cognitive knowledge assessments were conducted. In general, the findings in the longitudinal study (including three repeated measures) validated the affects of Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations on usage intention, and the important roles of support and encouragement in the formation of self-efficacy and outcome expectations. Limitations and implications are discussed. © 2006 M.E.

It is argued that learning is crucial to the success of ISD, and that many IS projects miscarry due to the inherently high levels of stress and anxiety that imbue ISD and that elicit defense-avoidance behavior patterns in project teams. Such social defenses reflect modes of group behavior that operate primarily to reduce anxiety, rather than reflecting genuine engagement with the task at hand. It is argued that the operation of these defenses can come to paralyze the learning processes that are critical to effective IS development Following a clinical research strategy, case studies are presented illustrating the working of defensive processes which undermined three IS projects. Three social defenses are illustrated: the organizational ritual, the sibling horde, and paranoid isolationism. Drawing on psychodynamic theory, the concept of transitional space is introduced. Such spaces have two important aspects: a supportive psychological climate and a supply of appropriate transitional objects (i.e., entities that provide temporary emotional support). It is argued that IS development should be reframed as a transitional space, with particular attention given to the selection of appropriate transitional objects to assist in breaking down defensive processes. The cases are revisited to illustrate this approach in action; useful insights and positive practical outcomes are shown. It is concluded that the present psychodynamic perspective has considerable value in relation to the IS discipline: theoretically, in terms of our understanding of the social dynamics of ISO and at a practical level too, through the provision of diagnostic concepts and remedial measures that have significant potential to enhance IS praxis and to redress the high rate of IS failure.","IS development; Methodologies and models; Organizational learning; Social defenses; Stress and anxiety; Transitional objects; Transitional space","Information technology; Learning systems; Professional aspects; Social aspects; Societies and institutions; Systems analysis; Information system (IS) development; Methodologies and models; Organizational learning; Social defenses; Stress and anxiety; Transitional objects; Transitional space; Management information systems","","","","","","","Wastell D.G., The fetish of technique: Methodology as a social defense, Information Systems Journal, 6, 1, pp. 25-40, (1996); Wastell D.G., Newman M., The behavioral dynamics of information system development: A stress perspective, Accounting, Management and Information Technology, 3, 2, pp. 121-148, (1993); Wastell D.G., Newman M., Information system design, stress and organisational change in the ambulance services: A tale of two cities, Accounting, Management and Information Technology, 6, 4, pp. 283-300, (1996); Winnicott D.W., Babies and Their Mothers, (1987)","D.G.

A research model, which suggests that task interdependence, goal conflict, and coordination strategies significantly affect productivity and satisfaction associated with software design and coding activities, is presented. Issues such as contingency/design misfit, conflicting contingencies, and the extent of deviation to theoretically prescribed coordination mechanisms applied to contingencies are used to make predictions on productivity and process satisfaction. A 2×2×2 factorial experiment was utilized. Overall, projects characterized by low task interdependence exhibited greater productivity than projects with high task interdependence. Also, in general, organic coordination was more productive than mechanistic coordination. There was also a significant interaction between task interdependence and coordination strategy. Low goal conflict and organic coordination each lead to greater process satisfaction. Productivity results for the goal conflict manipulation was opposite to the hypothesized direction. Unconflicted contingencies addressed with consistent coordination and partially conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination used, exhibited significant gains in productivity. In comparison, unconflicted contingencies with inconsistent coordination and conflicted contingencies, regardless of the coordination applied, resulted in lower productivity. This suggests that there are instances where multiple contingencies, which warrant the use of different coordination strategies, can be adequately addressed with a specific coordination strategy.","Contingency theory;

Our study posits that the effect of IT is not predetermined by its technological capabilities. Rather, its effect on interorganizational collaboration is the emergent properties of the interplay between IT and existing relationships between partners. Based on the literature, we selected four dimensions of supplier-retailer relationship (trust, interdependence, long-term orientation, and information sharing) to investigate the moderating effect of existing relationships on the efficacy of IT. Using case research that involved direct observation and systematic interviews with five pairs of suppliers and retailers, we verified that existing formative contexts between partners both enable and constrain the effect of IT on interorganizational collaboration. In addition, IT reinforces and stabilizes the already existing interorganizational structures and arrangements. Overall, the results suggest that cooperative formative contexts between partners should precede the IT-based interorganizational linkage effort. © 2005 IEEE.","Information technology (IT); Interorganizational information systems (IOSs); Supplier-retailer relationship; Supply chain collaboration; Supply chain management","Industrial management; Industrial relations; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Interorganizational information systems; Supplier-retailer relationship; Supply chain collaboration; Supply chain management; Information technology","","","","","","","Anderson J.C., Narus J.A., A model of distributor firm and manufacturing firm working partnerships, J.

ClearBoard permits coworkers in two locations to draw with color markers or with electronic pens and software tools while maintaining direct eye contact and the ability to employ natural gestures. The ClearBoard design is based on the key metaphor of “talking through and drawing on a transparent glass window.” We describe the evolution from ClearBoard-1 1993 to ClearBoard-2 (which incorporates TeamPaint, a multiuser paint editor). Initial observations and findings gained through the experimental use of the prototype, including the feature of “gaze awareness,” are discussed. Further experiments are conducted with ClearBoard-0 (a simple mockup), ClearBoard-1, and an actual desktop as a control. In the settings we examined, the ClearBoard environment led to more eye contact and potential awareness of collaborator's gaze direction over the traditional desktop environment. © 1993, ACM.

Half the teams used a group support system (GSS), while the other half used traditional processes that were the habitual norms for this organization. In the teams using traditional project team processes, the leaders defined the teams' project goal, directed discussions, recorded and controlled the teams' notes, assigned tasks to team members, and prepared and presented the teams' report. In the GSS teams, the leaders faced leadership challenges or abdicated, regular members participated to a greater extent, the project goal emerged from team discussion, and the teams ' notes were open and widely distributed. In short, processes in the GSS teams were more participatory and democratic. At first, teams found the GSS-based meeting processes very uncomfortable and returned to traditional verbal discussion-based processes. Once they returned to these traditional processes, however, they found them uncomfortable and moved back to include more electronic communication-based processes. Participants' attitudes (satisfaction, perceived effectiveness, and cohesiveness) were initially lower in GSS teams, but gradually increased, until they equaled those of the traditional teams. There were significant differences in overall project outcomes: traditional teams developed conservative projects that met the unstated project agenda perceived by the team leaders. In contrast, GSS teams developed projects more closely aligned to the interests of team members.","Adaptive structuration theory; Appropriation; Group support systems; Participation; Participative management; Project teams; Technology adoption","Communication systems; Decision support systems; Information technology; Professional aspects; Project management; Group support systems; Participative management; Project teams; Management information systems","","","","","","","Ackermann F., Participants' perceptions on the role of facilitators using group decision support systems, Group Decision and Negotiatio, 5, 2, pp. 93-112, (1996); Ackermann F., Eden C., Issues in computer and non-computer supported GDSS's, Decision Support System, 12, 4-5, pp. 381-390, (1994); Ackermann F., Eden C., Contrasting single user and networked group decision support systems for strategy making, Group Decision and Negotiatio, 10, 1, pp. 47-66, (2001); Adams A., Bond S., Clinical specialty and organizational features of acute hospital wards, Journal of Advanced Nursin, 26, 6, pp. 1158-1167, (1997); Aydin C., Rice R.E., Bringing social worlds together: Computers as catalysts for new interactions in health care organizations, Journal of Health and Social Behavio, 33, 2, pp. 168-185, (1992); Bass B.M., Two decades of research and development in transformational leadership, European Journal of Work and Organizational Psycholog, 8, 1, pp. 9-32, (1999); Batenburg R.S., Bongers F.J., The role of GSS in participatory policy analysis: A field experiment, Information & Managemen, 39, 1, pp. 15-30, (2001); Groupware at the World Bank, Groupware and Teamwork: Invisible Aid or Technical Hindrance?, pp. 145-183, (1996); Bostrom R.P., Clawson V.K., Watson R.T., The importance of facilitator role behaviors: Implications for training facilitators and teachers to use GSS, Journal of Teaching in International Busines, 7, 4, pp. 7-30, (1996); Briggs R., Adkins M., Mittleman D., Kruse J., Miller S., Nunamaker J., A technology transition model derived from field investigation of GSS use aboard the U.S.S.

This research examines how information technology (IT) infrastructure flexibility affects M&A. We use a combination of secondary as well as matched-pair survey data from 100 midsize firms in Spain to investigate this relationship. The empirical analysis suggests that IT infrastructure flexibility affects M&A through two key pathways: (1) a flexible IT infrastructure facilitates the development of business flexibility that provides the responsiveness to seize M&A opportunities and make acquisitions, and (2) a flexible IT infrastructure facilitates the development of post-M&A IT integration capability that provides the control to integrate the IT and business resources of the acquired firm and realize the economic benefits from M&A.","Business flexibility; Business value of IT; Dynamic capability; Endogeneity; IT infrastructure flexibility; M&A activities; Post-M&A IT integration capability; Post-M&A performance","Management information systems; Business value of it; Dynamic capabilities; Endogeneity; IT infrastructures; IT integration capabilities; Outsourcing","","","","","Government of Spain, (ECO2013-47027-P, P11-SEJ-7294); European Commission, EC; Universidad de Granada, UGR; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","We thank Arun Rai (Senior Editor), the anonymous associate editor, and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments to improve this work.

We identify the life cycle phases (and their associated decision processes) of virtual organizations, describe the requirements for an information infrastructure to support the management of virtual organizations throughout their life cycle, and discuss how Inter/Intranet technologies provide the mechanisms required for virtual organization management. The importance of information infrastructure to virtual organization management is illustrated through a set of simulations that compare performance of traditional static (stable partnership) supply chains and dynamic (virtual) supply chains utilizing a dynamic material allocation (DMA) strategy to respond to environmental change. Our overall conclusion is that an information infrastructure, utilizing Internet and Intranet technology, can support the communication required for effective virtual organization management throughout its life cycle. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the actual usage of these grammars is only poorly understood. In particular, little is known about how properties of these grammars inform usage beliefs such as usefulness and ease of use. In this paper, we use an ontological theory to describe conceptual modeling grammars in terms of their ontological deficiencies, and formulate two propositions in regard to how these ontological deficiencies influence primary usage beliefs. Using BPMN as an example modeling grammar, we surveyed 528 modeling practitioners to test the theorized relationships. Our results show that users of conceptual modeling grammars perceive ontological deficiencies to exist, and that these deficiency perceptions are negatively associated with usefulness and ease of use of these grammars. With our research, we provide empirical evidence in support of the predictions of the ontological theory of modeling grammar expressiveness, and we identify previously unexplored links between conceptual modeling grammars and grammar usage beliefs. This work implies for practice a much closer coupling of the act of (re-)designing modeling grammars with usage-related success metrics.","Conceptual modeling; Ontology; Perception measurement; Usage behavior","Management information systems; Conceptual model; Ease-of-use; Grammar usage; Information systems requirements; Modeling practitioners; Ontological theories; Success metrics; Usage behavior; Ontology","","","","","","","Ahuja M.K., Thatcher J.B., Moving beyond intentions and toward the theory of trying: Effects of work environment and gender on post-adoption information technology use, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 29, 3, pp. 427-459, (2005); Bodart F., Patel A., Sim M., Weber R., Should optional properties be used in conceptual modelling? a theory and three empirical tests, Information Systems Research, 12, 4, pp. 384-405, (2001); Bowen P.L., O'Farrell R.A., Rohde F., An empirical investigation of end-user query development: The effects of improved model expressiveness vs. complexity, Information Systems Research, 20, 4, pp. 565-584, (2009); Business Process Modeling Notation Specification.

This article develops a comprehensive model for examining the satisfaction of small business users with information technology (SBUSIT). It is argued that current models are not applicable as they are targeted primarily towards either the traditional data processing or end-user computing environment. This study develops and statistically validates the SBUSIT model. The validated model and an accompanying instrument are provided. It is noteworthy that many new factors and specific items distinguish the model from current ones.","Computer satisfaction; Instrument; IT satisfaction; Reliability and validity; Small business computing; User satisfaction; Very small businesses","Administrative data processing; Computers; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Reliability; User interfaces; Computer satisfaction; End user computing; Small business computing; User satisfaction; Information technology","","","","","","","Alpar P., Ein-Dor P., Major IS concerns of entrepreneurial organizations, Information & Management, 20, pp. 1-11, (1991); Bailey J.E., Pearson S.W., Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, Management Science, 29, 5, pp. 530-545, (1983); Baroudi J.J., Orlikowski W.J., The problem of statistical power in MIS research, MIS Quaterly, 13, 1, pp. 87-106, (1989); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix, Psychological Bulletin, 50, pp. 81-105, (1959); Carnevale A.P., America and the New Economy, (1991); Carr H.H., Managing End User Computing, (1988); Cohen J., Cohen P., Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation for the Behavioral Sciences, (1975); Cronbach L.J., Coefficient alpha and the internal structure of tests, Psychometrika, 16, pp. 297-334, (1951); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Davis G.B., Olson M.H., Conceptual foundations, structure and development, Management Information Systems, 2nd.(Edn.), (1985); Delone W.H., Determinants of success for computer usage in small business, MIS Quarterly, 12, 1, pp. 51-61, (1988); Doll W.J., Torkzadeh G., The measurement of end-user computing satisfaction, MIS Quarterly, 12, 2, pp. 259-274, (1988); Farhoomad F., Hrycyk G.P., The feasibility of computers in the small business environment, American Journal of Small Business, SPRING, (1985); Hair J.F.

Because of this asymmetry and incompleteness, parties seeking knowledge may not be able to identify qualified knowledge providers, and the appropriate experts may fail to be motivated to engage in knowledge transfer. We propose a sender-receiver framework for studying knowledge transfer under asymmetric and/or incomplete information. We outline four types of information structures for knowledge transfer, and focus on the sender-advantage asymmetric information structure and the symmetric incomplete information structure. We develop formal game-theoretical models, show how information incompleteness and asymmetry may negatively influence knowledge transfer, and propose solutions to alleviate these negative impacts. Implications for knowledge transfer research and practice are also discussed.","Asymmetric information; Incomplete information; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Sender-receiver game","Information retrieval; Information theory; Information use; Management information systems; Asymmetric information structure; Interorganizational relationships; Knowledge transfer; Sender receiver framework; Knowledge engineering","","","","","","","Akerlof G., The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, pp. 488-500, (1970); Emerging Best Practice in Knowledge Management, (1996); Using Information Technology to Support Knowledge Management, (1997); Argote L., McEvily B., Reagans R., Managing Knowledge in Organizations: An Integrative Framework and Review of Emerging Themes, Management Science, 49, pp. 571-582, (2003); Aumann R., Agreeing to Disagree, Analysis of Statistics, 4, pp. 1236-1239, (1976); Multiunit Organizations and Multiunit Strategy: Advances in Strategic Management, (2001); Carlile P., Transferring, Translating and Transforming: An Integrative Framework for Managing Knowledge across Boundaries, Organization Science, 15, pp. 555-568, (2004); Cho I.-K., Kreps D.M., Signaling Game and Stable Equilibria, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 102, pp. 179-221, (1987); Cohen D., Toward a Knowledge Context: Report on the First Annual U.C.

This study examines the performance implications of alignment between CSFs and one source of competence, the organization's information technology (IT) capability. The effects of three antecedent factors–environmental uncertainty, integration, and IT management sophistication–are also examined. This paper uses survey data from 244 large academic institutions, along with some secondary data. Following the profile deviation approach to measure alignment, the academic institutions are divided into three clusters based on their CSFs: the academic comprehensives, the reputed giants, and the small educators. The ideal profile of IT capability is next developed for each cluster in terms of four dimensions: information retrieval, electronic communication, computing facilities for students, and computer‐aided education. Alignment is then computed for each institution as the proximity of its IT capability profile from the ideal IT capability profile for the cluster to which it belongs. The results suggest that alignment facilitates both perceived IT success and organizational performance. Moreover, sophisticated IT management facilitates both alignment and perceived IT success, environmental uncertainty facilitates perceived IT success but not alignment, and integration facilitates neither alignment nor perceived IT success.

To be most useful in decision-making, instruments like end-user computing satisfaction (EUCS), which are designed to evaluate system success, should be robust. That is, they should enable comparisons by providing equivalent measurement across diverse samples that represent the variety of conditions or population subgroups present in organizations. Using a sample of 1,166 responses, the EUCS instrument is tested for measurement invariance across four dimensions - respondent positions, types of application, hardware platforms, and modes of development. While the results suggest that the meaning of user satisfaction is context sensitive and differs across population subgroups, the 12 measurement items are invariant across all four dimensions. The 12-item summed scale enables researchers or practitioners to compare EUCS scores across the instrument's originally intended universe of applicability. © 2004 M.E.

Supply chain management as an innovative management mode provides a new solution for resolving these problems from systems perspective. Coordination is the core issue to improve construction performance in construction supply chain (CSC). In this paper, the concepts of CSC and CSC management are defined. Furthermore, the inter-organization problems that effect CSC coordination are identified. Considering the Internet fosters the integration of construction processes and provides an efficient platform for CSC coordination, this paper presents two types of Internet-enabled coordination mechanisms: market mechanism, such as auction and contracting, and coordination flow, including information hub and electronic marketplace, for improving construction performance and to accelerate the innovations in the construction industry. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.","Construction industry; Construction supply chain; Internet; Supply chain coordination","Computer supported cooperative work; Electronic communities; Internet; Management information systems; construction industry; Internet; management practice; Construction supply chain; Supply chain coordination; Construction industry","","","","","Harbin Institute of Technology, China; National Center for Technology, Policy and Management; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, (PolyU 5114/03E); Tenth Five-year Plan Key S&T Project of China, (2004BA209B03)","The work described in this paper was funded by the Tenth Five-year Plan Key S&T Project of China (2004BA209B03) and the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (PolyU 5114/03E).

Design/methodology/ approach: An empirical study is conducted in 21 technological companies (N=236) in Taiwan and the collected survey data are used to test the relationships among the four dimensions expressed in the proposed structural equation model. Findings: The results show that SDL has a direct and significant impact on OL and KMC. SDL influences OP indirectly through OL and KMC. In addition, OL and KMC have direct and significant influences on OP. Research limitations/ implications: The source of data collected is Taiwan, hence, the results may not be easily generalized to other areas or countries. However, the findings are valuable for managers' reference, especially for those whose circumstances are similar to those in Taiwan. Practical implications - The conceptual structural equation model provides useful information for managers to enhance OP through the adoption of appropriate SDL, OL and KMC strategies. Originality/value: The study demonstrates how SDL indirectly impacts OP and illustrates the paths of influence through either OL or KMC. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Knowledge management; Organizational performance; Self-managed learning; Workplace training","Administrative data processing; Education; Information management; Knowledge management; Management information systems; Managers; Empirical studies; Four dimensions; Indirect effects; Organizational learnings; Organizational performance; Organizational performances; Practical implications; Self-managed learning; Significant impacts; Structural equation models; Survey datums; Workplace training; Mathematical models","","","","","","","Afiouni F., Human resource management and knowledge management: A road map toward improving organizational performance, Journal of American Academy of Business, Cambridge, 11, 2, pp. 124-30, (2007); Akerlind G.S., Trevitt A.C., Enhancing self-directed learning through educational technology: When students resist the change, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 36, 2, pp. 96-105, (1999); Alavi M., Leidner D., Review: Knowledge management and knowledge management systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues, MIS Quarterly, 25, 1, pp. 107-36, (2001); Aldawni A.M., Palvai P.C., Developing and validating an instrument for measuring user-perceived web quality, Information & Management, 39, 6, pp. 467-76, (2002); Amy A.H., Leaders As Facilitators of Organizational Learning, (2005); Andersen J.A., Leadership, personality and effectiveness, Journal of Socio-Economics, 35, 6, pp. 1078-91, (2006); Battor M., Zairi M., Francis A., Knowledge-based capabilities and their impact on performance: A best practice management evaluation, Business Strategy Series, 9, 2, pp. 47-56, (2008); Beitler M.A., Mitlacher L.W., Information sharing, self-directed learning and its implications for workplace learning: A comparison of business student attitudes in Germany and the USA, Journal of Workplace Learning, 19, 8, pp. 526-36, (2007); Bogner W.C., Bansal P., Knowledge management as the basis of sustained high performance, Journal of Management Studies, 44, 1, pp. 165-88, (2007); Bonham L.A., Self-directed learning: Emerging theory & practice, Self-directed Orientation Toward Learning: A Learning Style, pp. 55-68, (1989); Bontis N., Crossan M.M., Hulland J., Managing on organizational learning system by aligning stocks and flows, Journal of Management Studies, 39, 4, pp. 437-69, (2002); Calder J., McCollumn A., Open and Flexible Learning in Vocational Education & Training, (1998); Campbell D.T., Fiske D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix, Psychology Bulletin, 53, pp. 81-105, (1959); Cepeda G., Vera D., Dynamic capabilities and operational capabilities: A knowledge management perspective, Journal of Business Research, 60, 5, pp. 426-37, (2007); Chan S.C.H., Ngai E.W.T., Electronic learning systems: An analysis of the characteristics of adopters and non-adopters, International Journal of Innovation and Learning, 5, 6, pp. 664-82, (2008); Chang C.-C., Evaluating the effects of competency-based web learning on self-directed learning aptitudes, The Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching, 26, 3, pp. 197-216, (2007); Chen H.-Y., The Study on the Relationship of the Self-directed Learning Readiness and Management Competency and Job Performance - Perceived Organization Supporting As Moderator, (2005); Chen H.-C., Iii H.

Despite much work in the methodological literature on specific aspects of method bias, such as common method bias and self-report bias, the meaning of method bias remains unclear, and there is no comprehensive approach for dealing with it. This paper offers a clear definition of method bias, proposes a more comprehensive approach for dealing with it, and describes a demonstration exercise applying the approach in an empirical study of how individual system use and task performance relate. The demonstration suggests that the approach is feasible and illustrates how it can help researchers test theories and identify new research opportunities.","Construct; Measurement; Method bias; Method variance; Qualitative; Quantitative; Validity","Measurement; Construct; Method bias; Method variances; Qualitative; Quantitative; Validity; Management information systems","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Ashcraft M.H., Cognition, (2002); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., Multitrak-multimethod matrices in consumer research, Journal of Consumer Research, 17, pp. 426-439, (1991); Barki H., Titah R., Boffo C., Information system userelated activity: An expanded behavioral conceptualization of individual-level information system use, Information Systems Research, 18, 2, pp. 173-192, (2007); Bern D.J., Self-perception theory, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 6, pp. 1-62, (1972); Berthon P., Pitt L., Ewing M., Carr C.L., Potential research space in MIS: A framework for envisioning and evaluating research replication, extension, and generation, Information Systems Research, 13, 4, pp. 416-427, (2002); Blair E., Burton S., Cognitive processes used by survey respondents to answer behavioral frequency questions, Journal of Consumer Research, 14, pp. 280-288, (1987); Bolger F., Onkal-Atay D., The effects of feedback on judgmental interval predictions, International Journal of Forecasting, 20, 1, pp. 29-39, (2004); Bollen K.A., Lennox R., Conventional wisdom on measurement: A structural equation perspective, Psychological Bulletin, 110, 2, pp. 305-314, (1991); Borsboom D., Measuring the Mind, (2005); Scientific inquiry and the social sciences, A Volume in Honor of Donald T.

Pair programming, a core practice of this methodology, involves two programmers working collaboratively to develop software. This study examined the efficacy of pair programming by comparing the performance effectiveness and affective responses of collaborating pairs with those of individual programmers treated as nominal pairs. In a controlled laboratory experiment involving student subjects, proxies for entry level programmers working on entry level tasks, two factors were manipulated: programming setting (collaborativepair versus individuals) and programming task complexity (high versus low). Participants who worked in the individual condition were randomly combined into nominal pairs. The performance and affective responses of the collaborating pairs were then compared with those of the best performers and the second best performers of each nominal pair. Results indicated that programming pairs performed at the level above the second best performers and at the level of the best performers in each nominal pair. This relationship was found to be consistent across both levels of task complexity. Consequently, there was no evidence of an ""assembly bonus effect, "" where the performance of a collaborating pair exceeds the performance of its best member working alone. While this finding may appear counterintuitive due to the general perception of two heads being better than one, it is consistent with the findings in small group research. When affective responses were considered, programming pairs reported higher levels of satisfaction than those of the best and second-best performing members in nominal pairs. They also showed higher levels of confidence in their performance compared to those of the second-best members. But the confidence levels of pairs were no different from those of the best performing members in nominal pairs. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented.","Agile methodology; Assembly bonus effect; Group problem solving; Nominal group; Pair programming; Software development; Team performance","Management information systems; Software engineering; Agile Methodologies; Controlled laboratories; EXtreme Programming; Nominal group; Pair-programming; Productivity paradox; Software development methodologies; Team performance; Software design","","","","","","","Aiello J.R., Douthitt E.A., Social Facilitation from Triple to Electronic Performance Monitoring, Group Dynamics, 5, 3, pp. 163-180, (2001); Arisholm E., Gallis H., Dyba T., Sjeberg D.I.K., Evaluating Pair Programming with Respect to System Complexity and Programmer Expertise, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 33, 2, pp. 65-86, (2007); Baheti P., Gehringer E., Stotts D., Exploring the Efficacy of Distributed Pair Programming, Extreme Programming and Agile Methods - XP/Agile Universe 2002, pp. 208-220, (2002); Beck K., Embracing Change with Extreme Programming, IEEE Computer, 32, 10, pp. 70-77, (1999); Beck K., Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, (2000); Bhattacherjee A., Understanding Information Systems Continuance: An Expectation-Confirmation Model, MIS Quarterly, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001); Bodart F., Patel A., Sim M., Weber R., Should Optional Properties Be Used in Conceptual Modeling?

Individual mindfulness in IT use has not been studied systematically. Through three programmatic empirical studies, this paper develops a scale for IT mindfulness and tests its utility in the post-adoption system use context. Study 1 develops a measure of IT mindfulness and evaluates its validity and reliability. Study 2 employs a laboratory experiment to examine whether IT mindfulness can be manipulated and whether its influence is consistent across technological contexts. Study 3 places IT mindfulness in a nomological network and tests the construct's utility for predicting more active system use (e.g., trying to innovate and deep structure usage) as well as more automatic system use (e.g., continuance intention). Our primary contribution includes the development and validation of a scale for IT mindfulness. In addition, we demonstrate that IT mindfulness (1) differs from important existing concepts such as cognitive absorption, (2) can be manipulated, (3) more closely relates to active system use than automatic system use, and (4) provides more predictive power within the IS context than general trait mindfulness. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

This study tests the relationship between the integration of IS during mergers and acquisitions and their effectiveness. The findings point to a positive relationship between IS integration and effectiveness only when controlling for (a) IT intensity, and (b) organizational culture differences between the joining firms. Thus, managers are advised to take into account IT intensity and cultural differences during the pre-merger negotiations and during the post-merger integration process.","Conversion effectiveness; Information systems (IS) integration;

We report the results of a study focused on the issue of facilitating the movement of experienced COBOL programmers to become users of the C programming language. The study, conducted at a major financial services firm, is based upon a behavioral model of the acceptance of innovations that derives its foundations from research in social psychology, information technology acceptance, and innovation adoption. The model posits a relationship between beliefs about a target new technology and the subsequent adoption of the technology. Beliefs, in turn, are hypothesized to be influenced by a variety of external factors such as training and individual characteristics. Results suggest that certain beliefs do play a central role in determining acceptance behavior. Results also point to external factors such as organizational tenure, prior technical knowledge, training experiences, and perceived job insecurity that have significant effects on these beliefs. Theoretical and practical implications that follow are discussed. ©2000 IEEE.","Information technology implementation; Information technology innovation; Innovation diffusion; Software process improvement; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; COBOL (programming language); Information technology; Professional aspects; Social aspects; Software engineering; Technology transfer; Software process innovations; Management information systems","","","","","","","Adams D.A., R.

We present a theory-generating, interpretative field study of a highly complex and successful building project by architect Frank O. Gehry. We argue that what has been labeled collective mindfulness is only possible through a dialectic process of collective minding, in which organizational actors simultaneously exhibit elements of being mindful and mindless. Our analysis reveals that collective minding emerges from struggling with contradictions in the five elements of mindfulness. We argue that when actors struggle with these dialectic tensions, the same information technology capabilities are enacted as multiple, contradictory technologies-in-practice. Implications for the further study of collective minding and the appropriation of IT capabilities are discussed.","Collective mindfulness; Collective minding; Complex sociotechnical systems; Dialectics;

An understanding of how teams embrace and use such collaborative systems - and the relationship of that usage to teamwork quality and team performance - is critical for organizational success. We present a theoretical model in which usage of a collaborative system intervenes between teamwork quality and team performance for tasks that are supported by the system. We empirically validate the model in a setting where established teams voluntarily used a collaborative system over a four-month period to perform tasks with measurable outcomes. Our principal finding is that collaborative system use intervenes between teamwork quality and performance for tasks supported by the system but not for unsupported tasks.","Collaboration technology; Collaborative systems; Computer self-efficacy (CSE); Group support systems (GSS); Groupware; Team performance; Teamwork","Computer supported cooperative work; Research; Societies and institutions; Technology; Collaborative technology; Management information systems","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Agarwal R., Sambamurthy V., Stair R.M., Research report: The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy - An empirical assessment, Information Systems Research, 11, 4, pp. 418-430, (2000); Bandura A., Social Foundations of Thought and Action, (1986); Bandura A., Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, (1997); Benbasat I., Lai-Huat L., The effects of group, task, context and technology variables on the usefulness of group support systems: A meta-analysis of experimental studies, Small Group Research, 24, 4, pp. 430-462, (1993); Bentler P.M., Chou C.P., Practical issues in structural modeling, Sociological Methods & Research, 16, 1, pp. 78-117, (1987); Carmines E.G., McIver J.P., Analysing models with unobserved variables: Analysis of covariance structures, Social Measurement: Current Issues, pp. 65-110, (1981); Chidamabaram L., Relational development in computer-supported groups, MIS Quarterly, 20, 2, pp. 143-165, (1996); Chin W., Issues and opinion on structural equation modeling, MIS Quarterly, 22, 1, (1998); Compeau D.R., Higgins C.A., Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test, MIS Quarterly, 19, 2, pp. 189-211, (1995); Compeau D.R., Higgins; C.A., Huff S., Social cognitive theory and individual reactions to computing technology: A longitudinal study, MIS Quarterly, 23, 2, pp. 145-158, (1999); Dennis A.R., Wixom B.H., Investigating the moderators of the group support systems use with meta-analysis, Journal of Management Information Systems, 17, 3, pp. 235-257, (2001); Dennis A.R., Nunamaker J.F.

Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) is rapidly becoming an important theoretical paradigm for comprehending the impacts of advanced information technologies (DeSanctis and Poole 1994). Intended as a complement to the faithfulness of appropriation scale developed by Chin et al. (1997), this research note describes the development of an instrument to capture the AST construct of consensus on appropriation. Consensus on appropriation (COA) is the extent to which group participants perceive that they have agreed on how to adopt and use a technology. While consensus on appropriation is an important component of AST, no scale is currently available to capture this construct. This research note develops a COA instrument in the context of electronic meeting systems use. Initial item development, statistical analyses, and validity assessment (convergent, discriminant, and nomological) are described here in detail. The contribution of this effort is twofold: First, a scale is provided for an important construct from AST. Second, this report serves as an example of rigorous scale development using structural equation modeling. Employing rigorous procedures in the development of instruments to capture AST constructs is critical if the sound theoretical base provided by AST is to be fully exploited in understanding phenomena related to the use of advanced information technologies.","Adaptive Structuration Theory; Electronic Meeting Systems; Scale Development; Structural Equation Modeling; Technology Appropriation","Electronic commerce; Enterprise resource planning; Information technology; Management information systems; Adaptive structuration theory (AST); Information science","","","","","","","Arbuckle J., AMOS 4.0 User's Guide, (1999); Asch S.E., Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments, Readings in Social Psychology, (1952); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, J.

Yet, it is often claimed that the actual benefits of IT are disappointing at best, and that IT spending has failed to yield significant productivity gains - hence the productivity paradox. Evidence is fragmented and somewhat mitigated. This paper argues that the current state of empirical research results from a failure to understand the interplay between IT and managerial work. It addresses this issue by analyzing patterns of association between IT usage and the nature of managerial work in different organizational contexts. Fifty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with middle line managers in three large companies: a Bank, a Telecommunications company, and a Utility. In addition, daily activities and IT usage were logged. The data indicate that the relationship between the level of IT usage and the nature of managerial work was stronger in the two organizations that were reorienting their strategies (Bank, Telecommunications) than in the one pursuing its existing strategy (Utility). It was also found that the pattern of the relationship between IT usage and the nature of managerial work depended on the kind of strategic reorientation implemented by the firm. For instance, in the Bank, the level of IT usage was associated with the amount of time spent by managers on information-related activities (e.g., reading reports, gathering information) and on disturbance handling activities (e.g., resolving conflicts, managing crises). In the Telecommunications company, IT usage was associated with more time spent on information-related activities and less on negotiation-related activities (e.g., discussions with colleagues on resource sharing, discussions with subordinates on performance standards). This finding suggests that heavy IT users paid greater attention to and spent more time on the roles they performed best with the technology (information-related activities) and may in fact have been embarking on an over-specialization trajectory.","IS evaluation; IS impacts; IS usage; Management roles; Organizational strategies","Knowledge acquisition; Management information systems; Personnel; Productivity; Resource allocation; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Telecommunication industry; IS evaluation; IS impacts; IS usage; Management roles; Organizational strategies; Profitability; Information technology","","","","","","","Applegate L.M., In search of a new organizational model: Lessons from the field, Communication Technology and Organizational Forms, (1998); Barley S.R., Technology as an occasion for structuring: Evidence from observations of CT scanners and the social order of radiology departments, Administrative Science Quarterly, 31, pp. 78-108, (1986); Barua A., Kriebel C., Mukhopadhyay T., Information technology and business value: An analytic and empirical investigation, Working Paper, (1991); Bjorn-Andersen N., Pedersen P.H., Computer facilitated changes in the managerial power structure, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 5, 2, pp. 203-216, (1980); Brandt J.R., Middle management: Where the action will be, Industry Week, pp. 30-36, (1994); Brynjolfsson E., The productivity paradox of information technology, Communications of the ACM, 26, 12, pp. 67-77, (1993); Zmuidzinas M., Kling R., George J., Desktop computerization as a continuing process, Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 125-137, (1990)","A.

In particular, more and more firms have started strategically using the online user innovation communities (OUICs) for open innovation initiatives. The extent to which firms are able to derive business value from OUICs, however, has not been systematically examined. Drawing on a multi-theoretical foundation from the framework of dynamic capabilities and the view of innovation value chain, we conceptualize two OUIC-enabled capabilities, which are, ideation capability related to collecting user-generated ideas about potential innovation from OUIC, and implementation capability related to selecting user-generated ideas for innovation development and introducing developed innovation via OUIC. Using a large-scale panel data set consisting of 1676 firm-day observations from Dell and Starbucks, we examine the impacts of OUIC-enabled capabilities on firm value. We find robust evidence that OUIC-enabled ideation capability actually does not influence firm value, whereas OUIC-enabled implementation capability increases firm value. Novel theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Business value of information technology; Crowdsourcing; Information technology capabilities; Online user innovation communities; Open innovation; Social media","Crowdsourcing; Information systems; Management information systems; Business value; Implementation capabilities; Managerial implications; Online users; Open innovation; Social media; Theoretical foundations; User-generated content; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Achen C.H., Why Lagged Dependent Variables can Suppress the Explanatory Power of Other Independent Variables, (2001); Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Andrade M., Mitchell M., Stafford E., New evidence and perspectives on mergers, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 2, pp. 103-120, (2001); Aral S., Weill P., IT assets, organization capabilities, and firm performance: how resource allocations and organizational differences explain performance variation, Organization Science, 18, 5, pp. 763-780, (2007); Bardhan I., Krishnan V., Lin S., Business value of information technology: testing the interaction effect of IT and R&D on Tobin's Q, Information Systems Research, 24, 4, pp. 1147-1161, (2013); Bayus B.L., Crowdsourcing new product ideas over time: An analysis of the Dell IdeaStorm community, Management Science, 59, 1, pp. 226-244, (2013); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: an empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bharadwaj A., Bharadwaj S.G., Konsynski B.R., Information technology effects on firm performance as measured by Tobin's q, Management Science, 45, 7, pp. 1008-1024, (1999); Binder J.J., The event study methodology since 1969, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 11, 2, pp. 111-137, (1998); Bollen J., Mao H., Zeng X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market, Journal of Computational Science, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Brown S.J., Warner J.B., Using daily stock returns: the case of event studies, Journal of Financial Economics, 14, 1, pp. 3-31, (1985); Chae H.C., Koh C.E., Prybutok V.R., Information technology capability and firm performance: contradictory findings and their possible causes, MIS Quarterly, 38, 1, pp. 305-325, (2014); Chatterjee D., Richardson V.J., Zmud R.W., Examining the shareholder wealth effects of announcements of newly created CIO positions, MIS Quarterly, 25, 1, pp. 43-70, (2001); Chatterjee D., Pacini C., Sambamurthy V., The shareholder wealth and trading volume effects of IT infrastructure investments, Journal of Management Information Systems, 19, 2, pp. 7-43, (2002); Chen H., De P., Hu Y.J., Hwang B.H., Customers as Advisors: The Role of Social Media in Financial Markets, (2012); Chesbrough H.W., Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, (2003); Dehning B., Richardson V.J., Zmud R.W., The value relevance of announcements of transformational information technology investments, MIS Quarterly, 27, 4, pp. 637-656, (2003); Devaraj S., Kohli R., Performance impacts of information technology: is actual usage the missing link?, Management Science, 49, 3, pp. 273-289, (2003); Dewan S., Ren F., Risk and return of information technology initiatives: evidence from electronic commerce announcements, Information Systems Research, 18, 4, pp. 370-394, (2007); Di Gangi P.M., Wasko M., Steal my idea!

Yet, while much has been said about aligning IS functionality with the strategic intent and how to organizationally implement strategically aligned systems, less is known of how to successfully implement strategic change associated with system use - a truly critical challenge within strategic IS implementation. Drawing on a strategy-as-practice perspective we address this gap by developing a multi-dimensional view of IS strategy, conceptualizing three key challenges in the IS strategy process, to explain how and why a paper mill, despite successfully implementing a strategic production management system, failed to produce intended strategic change. We call this outcome strategy blindness: organizational incapability to realize the strategic intent of implemented, available system capabilities. Using a longitudinal case study we investigate how cognitive rigidity of key actors and fixed, interrelated practices shaped the implementation of the new production system. We also identify core components and dynamics that constitute a richer multi-dimensional view of the IS strategy implementation (alignment) process. In particular, we identify three salient factors that contribute to strategy blindness - mistranslation of intent, flexibility of the IT artifact and cognitive entrenchment - and discuss how they affect strategic implementation processes. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for IS strategy theory and practice, especially the contribution of strategy-as-practice to this stream of research.© 2014 The Authors.

Given the espoused importance of replications to the extraction of knowledge from research, there is surprisingly little evidence of its practice or discussion of its importance in the management information systems literature. In this article We develop a framework within which to systematize the conceptualization of replications; we review and illustrate how some key information systems research fits into the framework and examine the factors that influence the selection of a research strategy. Our framework includes a conceptualization of the relationship among replication, extension, and generation in IS research. The concept of ""research space"" is defined and a framework is developed that delineates eight possible research strategies. Finally, the benefits of our framework to salient stakeholders in the research process are outlined.","Research; Research Issues; Research Methodology; Research Models; Research Status; Theoretical Evaluation","Knowledge based systems; Research; Strategic planning; Research methodology; Management information systems","","","","","","","Adams D.A., Nelson R.R., Todd P., Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quart., 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Bailey J.E., Pearson S.W., Development of a tool measuring and analysing computer user satisfaction, Management Sci., 29, 5, pp. 530-544, (1983); Bandura A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency, Amer.

Drawing on Bourdieu's practice theory, we argue that the production of any practice involves varying degrees of embodiment (i.e., relying on personal relationships) and objectification (i.e., relying on the exchange of objects). We subsequently characterize boundary-spanning practices according to their relative degrees of embodiment and objectification. We distinguish between ""market-like"", boundary-spanning practices, which rely primarily on an objectified mode of practice production, from ""community-like"" practices, which involve mostly the embodied mode of practice production. IT is then conceptualized as a medium for sharing objects in the production of practices. As such, IT use allows for the sharing of objects without relying on embodied relationships. We use data from an in-depth ethnographic case study to investigate how IT was used to transform community-like boundary-spanning practices within an organization into market-like ones. Moreover, we demonstrate how, as IT was used to support the exchange and combination of depersonalized objects, other aspects of the practice (such as the roles of intermediaries and the nature of meetings) also changed. The related changes in these diverse aspects of a boundary-spanning practice supported the trend toward greater objectification. IT use also increased visibility of the terms associated with object exchange. This increased visibility exposed the inequality of the exchange and encouraged the disadvantaged party to renegotiate the relationship. © 2006 M.E.

Instead of setting a single minimum support threshold for all items, they allow users to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items, and an Apriori-based algorithm, named MSapriori, is developed to mine all frequent itemsets. In this paper, we study the same problem but with two additional improvements. First, we propose a FP-tree-like structure, MIS-tree, to store the crucial information about frequent patterns. Accordingly, an efficient MIS-tree-based algorithm, called the CFP-growth algorithm, is developed for mining all frequent itemsets. Second, since each item can have its own minimum support, it is very difficult for users to set the appropriate thresholds for all items at a time. In practice, users need to tune items' supports and run the mining algorithm repeatedly until a satisfactory end is reached. To speed up this time-consuming tuning process, an efficient algorithm which can maintain the MIS-tree structure without rescanning database is proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show that our algorithms are much more efficient and scalable than the previous algorithm. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

By the evolution of internet and related communication technologies, CMS has become a key information technology (IT) for organizations to communicate with its internal and exterior environment. Just like any other IT projects, the selection of CMS consists of various tangible and intangible criteria which contain uncertainty and incomplete information. In this paper the selection of CMS among available alternatives is regarded as a multi criteria decision making problem. A decision model which consists of seven criteria and four alternatives is built, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) integrated Grey-TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method is proposed, and applied in a Turkish foreign trade company. In the proposed model, the weights of the criteria are determined by AHP method and the alternatives are evaluated by Grey-TOPSIS. Due to the uncertainties, grey numbers are used for evaluations of the alternatives. One at a time sensitivity analysis is also provided in order to monitor the robustness of the method. Besides, the effects of using different distance functions, such as Manhattan, Euclidian and Minkowski distance functions on the results are examined. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Eng., Nanyang Technological Univ., Singapore 639798, Singapore","Contractor selection is the process of selecting the most appropriate contractor to deliver the project as specified so that the achievement of the best value for money is ensured. Construction clients are becoming more aware of the fact that selection of a contractor based on tender price alone is quite risky and may lead to the failure of the project in terms of time delay and poor quality standards. Evaluation of contractors based on multiple criteria is, therefore, becoming more popular. Contractor selection in a multicriteria environment is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty inherent in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgment of decision makers (DMs). This paper presents a systematic procedure based on fuzzy set theory to evaluate the capability of a contractor to deliver the project as per the owner's requirements. The notion of Shapley value is used to determine the global value or relative importance of each criterion in accomplishing the overall objective of the decision-making process. The research reported upon forms part of a larger study that aims to develop a fuzzy decision model for construction contractor selection involving investigating multiple criteria selection tendencies of construction clients, relationship among decision criteria, and construction clients' preferences of criteria in the contractor selection process. An illustration with a bid evaluation exercise is presented to demonstrate the data requirements and the application of the method in selecting the most appropriate contractor for the project under uncertainty. The proposed model is not intended to supplant the work of decision-making teams in the contractor selection process, but rather to help them make quality evaluations of the available candidate contractors. One major advantage of the proposed method is that it makes the selection process more systematic and realistic as the use of fuzzy set theory allows the DMs to express their assessment of contractors' performance on decision criteria in linguistic terms rather than as crisp values.","Construction industry; Contractors; Decision making; Evaluation; Fuzzy sets","Construction industry; Contracts; Data reduction; Decision making; Evaluation; Fuzzy sets; Management information systems; Optimization; Quality control; Risk assessment; Standards; Construction projects; Contractors; Project delivery; Quality standards; Decision support systems","","","","","","","Barrie D., Paulson B., Professional Construction Management, 3rd Ed., (1992); Diekmann J.E., Cost-plus contractor selection: A case study, J.

In this paper, we develop a substantive grounded theory of control balancing that addresses this theoretical gap. Based on a longitudinal case study of an ISD offshoring project in the financial services industry, we introduce a three-dimensional control configuration category that emerged from our data, suggesting that control type is only one dimension on which control configuration decisions need to be made. The other two dimensions that we identified are control degree (tight versus relaxed) and control style (unilateral versus bilateral). Furthermore, we illustrate that control execution during the life cycle of an ISD offshoring project is highly intertwined with the development of client-vendor shared understanding and that each influences the other. Based on these findings, we develop an integrative process model that explains how offshoring project managers make adjustments to the control configuration periodically to allow the ISD offshoring project and relationship to progress, yielding the iterative use of different three-dimensional control configurations that we conceptualize in the paper. Our process model of control balancing may trigger new ways of looking at control phenomena in temporary interfirm organizations such as client-vendor ISD offshoring projects. Implications for research on organizational control and ISD offshoring are discussed. In addition, guidelines for ISD offshoring practitioners are presented.","Control balancing; Control dynamics; Grounded theory; Information systems development; Longitudinal case study; Offshoring projects; Organizational control; Outsourcing relationships; Process model; Project management","Information management; Information systems; Life cycle; Longitudinal control; Management information systems; Outsourcing; Project management; Control dynamic; Grounded theory; Information systems development; Longitudinal case study; Off-shoring; Organizational controls; Outsourcing relationships; Process Modeling; Process control","","","","","","","Bacharach S.B., Organizational theories: Some criteria for evaluation, The Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 496-515, (1989); Barker J.R., Tightening the iron cage: Concertive control in self-managing teams, Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, 3, pp. 408-437, (1993); Bradach J.L., Eccles R.G., Price, authority, and trust: From ideal types to plural forms, Annual Review of Sociology, 15, 1, pp. 97-118, (1989); Bryant A., Charmaz K., The Sage Handbook of Grounded Theory, (2007); Cardinal L.B., Sitkin S.B., Long C.P., Balancing and rebalancing in the creation and evolution of organizational control, Organization Science, 15, 4, pp. 411-431, (2004); Choudhury V., Sabherwal R., Portfolios of control in outsourced software development projects, Information Systems Research, 14, 3, pp. 291-314, (2003); Das T.K., Teng B.-S., Between trust and control: Developing confidence in partner cooperation in alliances, Academy of Management Review, 23, 3, pp. 491-512, (1998); Dibbern J., Winkler J., Heinzl A., Explaining variations in client extra costs between software projects offshored to India, MIS Quarterly, 32, 2, pp. 333-366, (2008); Eisenhardt K.M., Building theories from case study research, Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 532-550, (1989); Eisenhardt K.M., Furr N.R., Bingham C.B., Microfoundations of performance: Balancing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic environments, Organization Science, 21, 6, pp. 1263-1273, (2010); Eisenhardt K.M., Graebner M.E., Theory building from cases: Opportunities and challenges, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 1, pp. 25-32, (2007); Ghemawat P., Managing differences, Harvard Business Review, 85, 3, pp. 58-68, (2007); Glaser B.G., Theoretical Sensitivity, (1978); Glaser B.G., Emergence Vs.

Nontechnical users are empowered to adapt pliable technology in the course of normal usage episodes. We develop a theoretical perspective of adaptation behaviors by extending the adaptive structuration theory (AST) to the level of individuals, and present a topology of adaptation behaviors to capture the rich landscape of this emerging phenomenon. Based on this new theoretical perspective, we propose a research model and perform a survey study targeting young professionals to empirically investigate adaptation of malleable IT by users. Our findings reveal the compounding effects of four distinct adaptation behaviors including the insight that task adaptation mediates the effect of technology adaptation on individual performance. This study contributes by providing a theoretical framework for examining adaptation behaviors, extending AST to the level of individuals, and addressing specific criticisms of AST in the information systems literature.","Exploitation; Exploration; Post adoption IT use; Structuration episodes; Task adaptation; Technology adaptation","Management information systems; Natural resources exploration; Exploitation; Post adoptions; Structuration; Task adaptation; Technology adaptation; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Prasad J., A conceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology, Information Systems Research, 9, 2, pp. 204-215, (1998); Ahmadi N., Repenning A., Ioannidou A., Collaborative end-user development on handheld devices, Visual Languages and Human-centric Computing, pp. 237-241, (2008); Ahuja M.K., Thatcher J.B., Moving beyond intentions and toward the theory of trying: Effects of work environment and gender on post-adoption information technology use, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 427-459, (2005); Alexander P.A., Domain knowledge: Evolving themes and emerging concerns, Educational Psychologist, 27, 1, pp. 33-51, (1992); Al-Natour S., Benbasat I., The adoption and use of IT artifacts: A new interaction-centric model for the study of user-artifact relationships, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 10, 9, pp. 661-685, (2009); Atuahene-Gima K., Murray J.Y., Exploratory and exploitative learning in new product development: A social capital perspective on new technology ventures in China, Journal of International Marketing, 15, 2, pp. 1-29, (2007); Bandura A., Wood R., Effect of perceived controllability and performance standards on self-regulation of complex decision making, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, 5, pp. 805-814, (1989); Barki H., Titah R., Boffo C., Information system use-related activity: An expanded behavioral conceptualization of individual-level information system use, Information Systems Research, 18, 2, pp. 173-192, (2007); Barley S.R., Technology AS an occasion for structuring: Evidence from observations of CT scanners and the social order of radiology departments, Administrative Science Quarterly, 31, 1, pp. 78-108, (1986); Beaudry A., Pinsonneault A., Understanding user responses to information technology: A coping model of user adaptation, MIS Quarterly, 29, 3, pp. 493-524, (2005); Benner M.J., Tushman M., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 676-706, (2002); Berman S.L., Down J., Hill C.W.L., Tacit knowledge AS a source of competitive advantage in the national basketball association, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 1, pp. 13-31, (2002); Bhattacherjee A., Harris M., Individual adaptation of information technology, Journal of Computer Information Systems, 50, 1, pp. 37-45, (2009); Bostrom R.P., Gupta S., Thomas D., A meta-theory for understanding information systems within sociotechnical systems, Journal of Management Information Systems, 26, 1, pp. 17-47, (2009); Burton-Jones A., Straub D.W., Reconceptualizing system usage: An approach and empirical test, Information Systems Research, 17, 3, pp. 228-246, (2006); Bygstad B., Managing the dynamics of mutual adaptation of technology and organisation in information systems development projects, Software Process: Improvement and Practice, 10, 3, pp. 341-353, (2005); Chang J.W., Huang D.W., Choi J.N., Is task autonomy beneficial for creativity?

However, new demands on the supply-chain system require changes to information flow and exchange. We undertake a case study of three automotive supply chains that face such new demands resulting from the introduction of an order-driven supply-chain strategy. We use our case study findings to evaluate the applicability of three different theoretical lenses on the multi-faceted interactions between information, physical flow, and the complex rationales driving supply-chain evolution: the resource-based view (RBV), the concept of complex adaptive systems (CAS), and adaptive structuration theory (AST). We find that each theory has a separate realm of applicability and while complimentary in nature, provides distinct insight on the structural shift in the supply-chain system. More specifically, we find that AST, a theory prominent in the social sciences, provides novel insights to supply-chain research at the firm level, particularly with respect to the difficulties in using IT systems to drive systemic change. It complements both the system-level perspective offered by the complex adaptive systems theory, as well as the concept of dynamic capabilities originating in the resourced-based view. The paper concludes with wider implications for future research in supply and value chain management. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Several review studies were carried out to afford a better understanding of the current research trend of KM processes. However, this issue still needs to be examined from other perspectives. It is observed that previous research neglects the examination of KM processes studies with regard to ISs. The current study systematically reviews and sheds the light on KM processes studies related to ISs aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of 41 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2001 to 2018. The main findings of this study indicate that knowledge sharing is the most frequent KM process studied, followed by knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. Besides, questionnaire surveys were found to be the primarily relied research methods for data collection in the context of KM processes. In addition, 78% of the analyzed studies registered positive research outcomes. In terms of IS type, most of the analyzed studies focused on investigating the impact of KM processes on E-business systems, knowledge management systems, and IS outsourcing, respectively. Additionally, in terms of data collection, the majority of the analyzed studies were primarily focused on the participants who are IS executives/managers. Furthermore, most of the analyzed studies that achieved positive outcomes were carried out in China. To that end, this review study attempts to demonstrate and detail the recent increase in the interest and the advancement made in KM processes research considering ISs studies, which form an essential reference for scholars in KM field. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Information systems;

They reflect the cultural circumstances and ideological assumptions that underlie phenomena and the role played by key decision makers together with long-term economic, social, and political forces in creating them. Each of these benefits is accompanied by limitations such as, in most cases, a lack of mathematical tractability. The careful application of historical methods can overcome some of these limitations. A seven-step methodology is proposed: begin with focusing questions, specify the domain, gather evidence, critique the evidence, determine patterns, tell the story, and write the transcript.","History; Management information systems; Strategy","Computational complexity; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Project management; Research and development management; Strategic planning; Intellectual contributions; Research projects; Research synergy; Management information systems","","","","","","","Abernathy W.J., Utterback J., Patterns of industrial innovation, Technology Review, 80, 7, pp. 40-47, (1978); Ackoff R.L., Scientific Method: Optimizing Applied Research Decisions, (1962); Argyris C., Schon D.A., Theory in Practice: Increasing Professional Effectiveness, (1978); Barnard C.I., The Functions of the Executive, (1938); Bloch M., The Historian's Craft, (1953); Polybius, Histories I, (1922); Santayana G., The Life of Reason, 1, (1905); Schon D.A., Beyond the Stable State, (1971); Schumpeter J.A., Theory of Economic Development, (1934); Schumpeter J.A., Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, (1942); Schumpeter J.A., History of Economic Analysis, (1954); Simon J.L., Basic Research Methods in Social Science: the Art of Empirical Investigation, 3rd Ed., (1985); Singer E.A., Experience and Reflection, (1959); Teece D.J., Profiting from technological innovation: Implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy, Research Policy, 15, pp. 285-305, (1986); Tuchman B.W., Practicing History, (1981); Weick K.E., Theoretical assumptions and research methodology selection, The Information Systems Research Challenge, pp. 111-129, (1984); Wriston W.B., Management and the Information Society, (1989); Yin R.K., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (1984)","R.O.

Especially technology-based self-service channels have found their way into the 21st century service economy. While research embraces these channels for their cost-efficiency, it has not examined whether a shift from personal to self-service affects customer-firm relationships. Drawing from the service-dominant logic and its central concept of value-in-context, we discuss customers' value creation in self-service and personal service channels and examine the long-term impact of these channels on customer retention. Using longitudinal customer data, we investigate how the ratio of self-service versus personal service use influences customer defection over time. Our findings suggest that the ratio of self-service to personal service used affects customer defection in a U-shaped manner, with intermediate levels of both self-service and personal service use being associated with the lowest likelihood of defection. We also find that this effect mitigates over time. We conclude that firms should not shift customers toward self-service channels completely, especially not at the beginning of a relationship. Our study underlines the importance of understanding when and how self-service technologies create valuable customer experiences and stresses the notion of actively managing customers' cocreation of value.","Customer defection; Customer retention; E-service; Longitudinal; Self-service; Value-in-context","Management information systems; Customer defections; Customer retention; E- services; In contexts; Longitudinal; Self-service; Sales","","","","","","","Al-Natour S., Benbasat I., The adoption and use of IT artifacts: A new interaction-centric model for the study of user-artifact relationships, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 10, 9, pp. 661-685, (2009); American Bankers Association, ABA Survey: Popularity of Mobile Banking Continues to Climb, (2013); Ba S., Stallaert J., Zhang Z., Balancing IT with the human touch: Optimal investment in IT-based customer service, Information Systems Research, 21, 3, pp. 423-442, (2010); Barnes J.G., Closeness, strength, and satisfaction: Examining the nature of relationships between providers of financial services and their retail customers, Psychology and Marketing, 14, 8, pp. 765-790, (1997); Barnes J.G., Dunne P.A., Glynn W.J., Self-service and technology: Unanticipated and unintended effects on customer relationships, Handbook of Services Marketing and Management, pp. 89-102, (2000); Bearden W.O., Malhotra M.K., Uscategui K.H., Customer contact and the evaluation of service experiences: Propositions and implications for the design of services, Psychology & Marketing, 15, 8, pp. 793-809, (1998); Bendapudi N., Berry L.L., Customers' motivations for maintaining relationships with service providers, Journal of Retailing, 73, 1, pp. 15-37, (1997); Bitner M.J., Brown S.W., Meuter M.L., Technology infusion in service encounters, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 138-149, (2000); Bolton R.N., A dynamic model of the duration of the customer's relationship with a continuous service, Marketing Science, 17, 1, pp. 45-65, (1998); Bolton R.N., Lemon K.N., A dynamic model of customers' usage of services: Usage as an antecedent and consequence of satisfaction, Journal of Marketing Research, 36, 2, pp. 171-186, (1999); Bolton R.N., Lemon K.N., Verhoef P.C., The theoretical underpinnings of customer asset management: A framework and propositions for future research, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 32, 3, pp. 271-292, (2004); Bowman D., Survival models for marketing strategy, Assessing Marketing Strategy Performance, pp. 115-144, (2004); Box-Steffensmeier J.M., Zorn C.J.W., Duration models and proportional hazards in political science, American Journal of Political Science, 45, 4, pp. 972-988, (2001); Buell R.W., Campbell D., Frei F.X., Are self-service customers satisfied or stuck, Production and Operations Management, 19, 6, pp. 679-697, (2010); Campbell D., Frei F.X., The cost structure, customer profitability, and retention implications of self-service distribution channels: Evidence from customer behavior in an online banking channel, Management Science, 56, 1, pp. 4-24, (2010); Campbell C.S., Maglio P.P., Davis M.M., From self-service to super-service: A resource mapping framework for co-creating value by shifting the boundary between provider and customer, Information Systems and E-business Management, 9, 2, pp. 173-191, (2011); Carlson J.R., Zmud R.W., Channel expansion theory and the experiential nature of media richness perceptions, Academy of Management Journal, 42, 2, pp. 153-170, (1999); Cenfetelli R.T., Benbasat I., Al-Natour S., Addressing the what and how of online services: Positioning supporting-services functionality and service quality for business-to-consumer success, Information Systems Research, 19, 2, pp. 161-181, (2008); Chan K.W., Yim C.K.B., Lam S.S.K., Is customer participation in value creation a double-edged sword?

This has undermined expected benefits from ERP implementation, and in extreme cases of package-organisational misalignment, has led to project and even organisational failure. In this study, we explain package-organisational misalignments as the result of differences between the structures embedded in the package and those embedded in the organisation. These differences reflect the different institutional context of the package developers and implementing organisation. Some organisational structures are imposed while other structures are voluntarily adopted. The organisation has less control in the case of imposed structures and misalignments associated with imposed structures are therefore more likely to be resolved through package customization. We apply the framework to three hospitals implementing the same ERP package, identify the structural sources of the misalignments, and analyze the relationship to the type of resolution (package customization or organisational adaptation). We found that imposed structures were indeed overwhelmingly resolved through package customization, while most voluntarily acquired structures were resolved via organisational adaptation. We identified the different context specific sources for these structural differences and contribute to the research on ERP implementation, institutional theory, as well as draw implications for practice in managing package-organisation misalignments. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, China has paid a great cost; e.g. severe environmental deterioration making it one of the most endangered urban and rural environments in the world. In improving the environment, China has taken a number of possible measures including promotion of ISO 14001. To investigate the implementation status of ISO 14001 and its impact on enterprises in China, a structured questionnaire survey has been conducted. The result indicates that the major motivation for the system was to seek entrance to the international market. The other benefits are: standardization of environmental management procedures for internal operations; saving resources and reducing wastage for corporate management; improving corporate image (CI) for marketing effects; enhancing environmental awareness of suppliers for supplier relations. Using relative importance analysis, the study identifies the critical factors affecting implementation of the standards. The top five out of 27 factors are: (1) environmental consciousness of top leaders; (2) environmental consciousness of middle management; (3) well-defined responsibility for environmental management; (4) legal system; and (5) legal enforcement. Based on the analysis and discussion, the study concludes that the Chinese government should take the lead in improving the legal framework, providing financial support and training to promote ISO 14001 to the Chinese enterprises. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Our research focuses on identifying important competencies for managing product portfolio complexity and on the development of appropriate theoretical explanations. We found three important competencies: product/technology portfolio strategy, organization and governance regarding complexity decisions, and product design and decision support systems. We explicate these competencies using a socio-technical systems theoretical perspective. Our findings provide the basis for a model describing the impact of complexity and complexity management on business unit profitability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This research examines the relationship between CIO influence behaviors and the successfulness of influence outcomes, utilizing a revised model initially developed by Yukl (1994). Focused interviews were first conducted with CIOs and their peers to gain insights into the phenomenon. A survey instrument was then developed and distributed to a sample of CIO and peer executive pairs to gather data with which to test a research model. A total of 69 pairs of surveys were eventually used for data analysis. The research model was found to be generally meaningful in the CIO-top management context. Furthermore, the influence behaviors rational persuasion and personal appeal exhibited significant relationships with peer commitment, whereas exchange and pressure were significantly related to peer resistance.

Improvement Practices","Rigby D.K., Bain and Company; Ledingham D., Technol./Perf. Improvement Practices","Disappointed by the high costs and elusive benefits, early adopters of customer relationship management systems came, in the post dot-com era, to view the technology as just another overhyped IT investment whose initial promise would never be fulfilled. But this year, something unexpected is happening. System sales are rising, and executives are reporting satisfaction with their CRM investments. What's changed? A wide range of companies are successfully taking a pragmatic, disciplined approach to CRM. Rather than use it to transform entire businesses, they've directed their investments toward solving clearly defined problems within their customer relationship cycle. The authors have distilled the experiences of these CRM leaders into four questions that all companies should ask themselves as they launch their own CRM initiatives: Is the problem strategic? Is the system focused on the pain point? Do we need perfect data? What's the right way to expand an initial implementation? The questions reflect a new realism about when and how to deploy CRM to best advantage. Understanding that highly accurate and timely data are not required everywhere in their businesses, CRM leaders have tailored their real-time initiatives to those customer relationships that can be significantly enhanced by ""perfect"" information. Once they've succeeded with their first targeted CRM project, they can use it as a springboard for solving additional problems. CRM, in other words, is coming to resemble any other valuable management tool, and the keys to successful implementation are also becoming familiar: strong executive and business-unit leadership, careful strategic planning, clear performance measures, and a coordinated program that combines organizational and process changes with the application of new technology.","","Commerce; Consumer Satisfaction; Cost Control; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; Management Information Systems; United States; commercial phenomena; consumer; cost control; human; information system; mass communication; organization and management; review; United States","","","","","","","","Bain and Company; email: darrell.rigby@bain.com","","","","","","","","00178012","","HABRA","15559450","English","Harv.

Because voluntary systems require users' volitional behavior, researchers have traced recent implementation failures to a lack of user commitment. However, gaps in our understanding of volitional usage behavior and user commitment have made it difficult to advance theory, research, and practice on this issue. To validate a proposed research model, cross-sectional, between-subjects, and within-subjects field data were collected from 714 users at the time of initial adoption and after six months of extended use. The model explained between 44.1 percent and 58.5 percent of the variance in adoption and usage behavior based upon direct effects of user commitment. Findings suggest that user commitment plays a critical role in the volitional acceptance and usage of such systems. Affective commitment - that is, internalization and identification based upon personal norms - exhibits a sustained positive influence on usage behavior. In contrast, continuance commitment - that is, compliance based upon social norms - shows a sustained negative influence from initial adoption to extended use. Theory development based upon Kelman's social influence framework offers new empirical insights about system users' commitment and how it affects volitional usage behavior. © 2005 M.E.

Their worth for managing the knowledge assets has not gone unnoticed: they have been promoted as safeguards to retain expert knowledge, to avoid knowledge erosion, etc. KBS are the outcome of a knowledge engineering process that may be seen as providing some of the building blocks of knowledge management. Although 'knowledge' is the first word in knowledge-based systems, they are hardly ever considered from a knowledge perspective. As a result, a biased view of the organizational value of KBS exists in the literature, putting an undue emphasis on technology. The key issue addressed in this article is: how does knowledge engineering relate to a broader perspective of knowledge management? A way to identify the issues to be addressed when valuing KBS as potential measures for knowledge management is presented. To illustrate its value, the outcomes of a recent empirical investigation of how KBS function within organizations are presented.","Knowledge management; Knowledge processing strategy; Knowledge-based systems; Organizational conditions for knowledge-based systems; Organizational impact of knowledge-based systems; Strategic application identification","Information management; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge engineering; Management information systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge processing strategy; Strategic application identification; Knowledge based systems","","","","","","","Abecker A., Bernardi A., Hinkelmann K., Kuhn O., Sintek M., Towards a well-founded technology for organizational memories, Proceedings of the AAAI Spring Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in Knowledge Management, pp. 1-7, (1997); Agarwal R., Brown S., Tanniru M., Assessing the impact of expert systems: The experiences of a small firm, Expert Systems with Applications: An International Journal, 7, 2, pp. 249-258, (1994); Argyris C., Schon D.A., Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective, (1978); Baldwin-Morgan A.A., The impact of an expert system for audit planning: Evidence from a case study, International Journal of Applied Expert Systems, 2, 3, pp. 159-174, (1994); Baldwin-Morgan A.A., Sangster A., Strategy and impacts of expert systems for bank lending, Expert Systems with Applications: An International Journal, 11, 4, pp. 455-462, (1996); Baldwin-Morgan A.A., Stone M.F., A matrix model of expert systems impacts, Expert Systems with Applications: An International Journal, 9, 4, pp. 599-608, (1995); Brachman R., Smith B.C., Special issue on knowledge representation, Sigart Newsletter, 70, pp. 1-138, (1980); Byrd T.A., Implementation and use of expert systems in organizations: Perceptions of knowledge engineers, Journal of Management Information Systems, 8, 8, pp. 97-116, (1992); Chipman S., Meyrowitz A.L., Foundations of Knowledge Acquisition: Cognitive Models of Complex Learning, (1993); Coats P.K., Why expert systems fail, Financial Management, 17, 3, pp. 77-86, (1988); Standard für wissensbasierte Systeme findet wenig Anklang, Computerwoche, 36, (1990); Croy M.J., Green M.G., Cook J.R., Assessing the impact of a proposed expert system via simulation, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 13, 1, pp. 1-16, (1995); Daniels H., Van Der Horst P., A cost/benefit analysis of expert systems, Organization, Management and Expert Systems, pp. 185-193, (1990); Dhaliwal J.S., Benbasat I., The use and effects of knowledge-based system explanations: Theoretical foundations and a framework for empirical evaluation, Information Systems Research, 7, 3, pp. 342-362, (1996); Dreyfus H.L., Dreyfus S.E., Mind over Machine: The Power of Human Intuition and Expertise in the Era of the Computer, (1986); Drucker P.F., Post-capitalist Society, (1993); Drucker P.F., The age of social transformation, The Atlantic Monthly, 274, 5, pp. 53-80, (1994); Duchessi P., O'Keefe T., O'Leary D., A research perspective: Artificial intelligence, management and organizations, international journal of intelligent systems in accounting, Finance and Management, 2, 3, pp. 151-159, (1993); Dutta S., Knowledge Processing and Applied Artificial Intelligence, (1993); Dutta S., Strategies for implementing knowledge-based systems, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44, 1, pp. 79-90, (1997); Engelmore R.S., Knowledge-based Systems in Japan, Baltimore, (1993); Fischer G., Ostwald J., Stahl G., Conceptual Frameworks and Computational Support for Organizational Memories and Organizational Learning, (1997); Gruber T.R., The Role of Standard Knowledge Representation for Sharing Knowledge-Based Technology, Technical Report KSL-90-53, (1990); Gruber T.R., Tenenbaum J.M., Weber J.C., Toward a knowledge medium for collaborative product development, Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Design, pp. 413-432, (1992); Hart A., Knowledge Acquisition for Expert Systems, 2nd Edn., (1992); Hauser R.D., Hebert F.J., Managerial issues in expert system implementation, S.A.M.

We conducted a behavioral experiment with EEG data from 83 social media users to understand whether they could detect fake news on social media, and whether the presence of a fake news flag affected their cognition and judgment. We found that the presence of a fake news flag triggered increased cognitive activity and users spent more time considering the headline. However, the flag had no effect on judgments about truth; flagging headlines as false did not influence users' beliefs. A post hoc analysis shows that confirmation bias is pervasive, with users more likely to believe news headlines that align with their political opinions. Headlines that challenge their opinions receive little cognitive attention (i.e., they are ignored) and users are less likely to believe them. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

The paper reports on the industrial supply chain studied, which was undergoing a Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) exercise. The aim of the BPR exercise was the streamlining of existing unstructured processes, ultimately culminating in the introduction of an ERP system into the organisation to improve information sharing between the supply chains echelons. The paper reviews previous work in this area and expands this work to address the issues posed by a more complex real industrial example. The model itself has been developed for a complex supply chain structure. This supply chain has multiple customers, distributors and product families, with customers and distributors face differing demand patterns. This model and its associated experimentation highlights the significant benefits achievable through the use of improved information sharing and forecasting techniques on the supply chain performance parameters. Potential total supply chain cost savings of up to 9.7% have been shown, with increased savings occurring with reduced system capacity. The model also quantifies the impact of collaboration between all partners in the study and shows that gains are achievable by all parties in the supply chain. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Consider, for example, material requirements planning (MRP) as part of current enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which is mainly driven by the bill of material (BOM). For information-intensive products such as insurances, and many other services, the workflow process typically evolves or is redesigned without careful consideration of the structure and characteristics of the product. In this paper, we present a method named product-based workflow design (PBWD). PBWD takes the product specification and three design criteria as a starting point, after which formal models and techniques are used to derive a favorable new design of the workflow process. The ExSpect tool is used to support PBWD. Finally, using a real case study, we demonstrate that a full evaluation of the search space for a workflow design may be feasible depending on the chosen design criteria and the specific nature of the product specifications.","Business process redesign; Formal methods; Process design; Workflow systems; Workflows","Planning; Product design; Specifications; Workflow systems; Management information systems","","","","","","","Van der Aalst W.M.P., Generic workflow models: How to handle dynamic change and capture management information, Proceedings of the Fourth IFCIS International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems (CoopIS'99), pp. 115-126, (1999); Van der Aalst W.M.P., On the automatic generation of workflow processes based on product structures, Computers in Industry, 39, 2, pp. 97-111, (1999); Van der Aalst W.M.P., Reengineering knock-out processes, Decision Support Systems, 30, 4, pp. 451-468, (2000); Van der Aalst W.M.P., Van Hee K.M., Workflow Management: Models, Methods, and Systems, (2002); Van der Aalst W.M.P., Reijers H.A., Limam S., Product-based workflow design, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on CSCW in Design, pp. 397-402, (2001); Van der Aalst W.M.P., De Crom P.J.N., Goverde R.R.H.M.J., Van Hee K.M., Hofman W.J., Reijers H.A., Van der Toorn R.A., ExSpect 6.4: An executable specification tool for hierarchical colored Petri nets, Application and Theory of Petri Nets 2000 (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), 1825, pp. 455-464, (2000); Aldowaisan T.A., Gaafar L.K., Business process redesign: An approach for process mapping, Omega, 27, 5, pp. 515-524, (1999); De Crom P.J.N., Reijers H.A., Using prototyping in a product-driven design of business processes, Proceedings of the Open Enterprise Solutions: Systems, Experiences, and Organizations Conference, pp. 41-47, (2001); Davenport T.H., Short J.E., The new industrial engineering: Information technology and business process redesign, Sloan Management Review, 31, 4, pp. 11-27, (1990); ExSpect 6.2 User Manual, (1998); (2001); Erens F., MacKay A., Sulonen R., Product modelling using multiple levels of abstraction - Instances as types, Computers in Industry, 24, 1, pp. 17-28, (1994); Hammer M., Reengineering work: Don't automate, obliterate, Harvard Business Review, 68, 4, pp. 104-112, (1990); Hammer M., Champy J., Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution, (1993); Van Hee K.M., Information System Engineering: A Formal Approach, (1994); Hegge H.M.H., Intelligent Product Family Descriptions for Business Applications, (1995); Herrmann Th., Walter T., The relevance of showcases for the participative improvement of business processes and workflow management, Proceedings of the Participatory Design Conference (PDI '98), pp. 117-127, (1998); Hofacker I., Vetschera R., Algorithmical approaches to business process design, Computers & Operations Research, 28, 13, pp. 1253-1275, (2001); Hupp T., Polak G., Westgaard O., Designing Work Groups, Jobs, and Work Flow, (1995); Kumar A., Van der Aalst W.M.P., Verbeek H.M.W., Dynamic work distribution in workflow management systems: How to balance quality and performance?, Journal of Management Information Systems, 18, 3, pp. 157-193, (2001); MacSweeney G., Traveling the long road to end-to-end processing, Insurance & Technology, 26, 10, pp. 30-34, (2001); O'Neill P., Sohal A.S., Business process redesign: A review of recent literature, Technovation, 19, 9, pp. 571-581, (1999); Orlicky A., Structuring the bill of materials for MRP, Production and Inventory Management, 13, 4, pp. 19-42, (1972); Orman L.V., A model management approach to business process redesign, Journal of Management Information Systems, 15, 1, pp. 187-212, (1998); Peppard J., Rowland P., The Essence of Business Process Re-engineering, (1995); Reijers H.A., Product-based design of business processes applied within the financial services, Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology, 34, 2, pp. 34-46, (2002); Reijers H.A., Goverde R.R.H.M.J., Smooth Cases: An Application of Product-based Design [In Dutch], (1999); Sharp A., McDermott P., Workflow Modeling: Tools for Process Improvement and Application Development, (2001); Sherwoord-Smith M., People centered process re-engineering: An evaluation perspective to office systems re-design, Business Process Re-engineering: Information Systems Opportunities and Challenges.

It argues that a full understanding of the process of implementation of such systems should include not only technical aspects but also the social dynamics of an organization; specifically core values, distribution of power and mechanisms of control. A theoretical framework is formulated based on punctuated equilibrium and previous SIS literature, and is applied to an exploratory case study conducted in a Latin American public organization. The case study depicts how the initiative to implement SIS was the result of external and internal disturbances. The case analysis highlights relationships between an organization's deep structure and SIS implementation. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the study. These include (1) the role of the formal organizational structure in influencing the outcome of SIS implementations, (2) the impact of exogenous contingencies such as elections and external funding that may create a sense of crisis and (3) the influence of newcomers who may be brought in to solve the crisis.","Case study;

The ease of seeking sex partners through classified ad sites may promote risky behaviors that increase the transmission of STDs. In this paper, using a natural experiment setup, we investigate whether the entry of a major online personals ad site, Craigslist, increases the prevalence of HIV over a 10 year period from 1999 to 2008 across 33 states in the United States. After controlling for extraneous factors, our results suggest that the entry of Craigslist is related to a 15.9 percent increase in HIV cases. Our analysis suggests that the site entry produces an average of 6,130 to 6,455 cases of HIV infection in the United States each year, mapping out to between $62 million and $65.3 million in annual treatment costs. In addition, the analyses reveal that nonmarket-related casual sex is the primary driver of the increase in HIV cases, in contrast to paid transactions solicited on the site (e.g., escort services and prostitution), which has a negative relationship with HIV trends. These findings are essential to understanding the social routes through which HIV transmission takes place and the extent to which site entry can influence HIV trends. Implications for healthcare practitioners and policy makers are discussed.","Classified ad sites; HIV; Internet; Online intermediaries; Transmission route","Internet; Classified ad sites; HIV transmission; Natural experiment; Online intermediaries; Online platforms; Risky behaviors; Transmission route; Treatment costs; Management information systems","","","","","","","Allison P.D., Waterman R.P., Fixed-effects negative binomial regression models, Sociological Methodology, 32, 1, pp. 247-265, (2002); Athey S., Stern S., The impact of information technology on emergency health care outcomes, RAND Journal of Economics, 33, 3, pp. 399-432, (2002); Ayyagari R., Grover V., Purvis R., Technostress: Technological antecedents and implications, MIS Quarterly, 35, 4, pp. 831-858, (2011); Bailey J.P., Bakos Y., An exploratory study of the emerging role of electronic intermediaries, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 1, 3, pp. 7-20, (1997); Bakos J.Y., Reducing buyer search costs: Implications for electronic marketplaces, Management Science, 43, 12, pp. 1676-1692, (1997); Baumeister R.F., Heatherton T.F., Self-regulation failure: An overview, Psychological Inquiry, 7, 1, pp. 1-15, (1996); Belotto A., Leanes L.F., Schneider M.C., Tamayo H., Correa E., Overview of Rabies in the Americas, Virus Research, 111, 1, pp. 5-12, (2005); Benotsch E., Kalichman S., Cage M., Men who have met sex partners via the internet: Prevalence, predictors, and Implications for HIV prevention, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 31, 2, pp. 177-183, (2002); Bertrand M., Duflo E., Mullainathan S., How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 1, pp. 249-275, (2004); Brynjolfsson E., Hu Y., Smith M.D., Consumer surplus in the digital economy: Estimating the value of increased product variety at Online booksellers, Management Science, 49, 11, pp. 1580-1596, (2003); Carballo-Dieguez A., Miner M., Dolezal C., Rosser B.R.S., Jacoby S., Sexual negotiation, HIV-status disclosure, and sexual risk behavior among latino men who use the Internet to seek sex with other men, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 35, 4, pp. 473-481, (2006); Carpenter C., Youth alcohol use and risky sexual behavior: Evidence from underage drunk driving laws, Journal of Health Economics, 24, 3, pp. 613-628, (2005); Chesson H.W., Blandford J.M., Gift T.L., Tao G., Irwin K.L., The estimated direct medical cost of sexually transmitted diseases among American youth, 2000, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 36, 1, pp. 11-19, (2004); Chiasson M., Parsons J., Tesoriero J., Carballo-Dieguez A., Hirshfield S., Remien R., HIV behavioral research online, Journal of Urban Health, 83, 1, pp. 73-85, (2006); Cunningham S., Kendall T.D., Risk behaviours among internet-facilitated sex workers: Evidence from two new datasets, Sexually Transmitted Infections, 86, pp. iii100-iii105, (2010); Cunningham S., Kendall T.D., Prostitution 2.0: The changing face of sex work, Journal of Urban Economics, 69, 3, pp. 273-287, (2011); Dranove D., Kessler D., McClellan M., Satterthwaite M., Is more information better?

(or any other WWW indexer's) categories can be used to describe the content of a document. Such categories offer a standardized and universal way for referring to or describing the nature of real world objects, activities, documents and so on, and may be used (we suggest) to semantically characterize the content of documents. WWW indices, like Yahoo! provide a huge hierarchy of categories (topics) that touch every aspect of human endeavors. Such topics can be used as descriptors, similarly to the way librarians use for example, the Library of Congress cataloging system to annotate and categorize books. In the course of investigating this idea, we address the problem of automatic categorization of web-pages in the Yahoo! directory. We use Telltale as our classifier; Telltale uses n-grams to compute the similarity between documents. We experiment with various types of descriptions for the Yahoo! categories and the webpages to be categorized. Our findings suggest that the best results occur when using the very brief descriptions of the Yahoo! categorized entries; these brief descriptions are provided either by the entries' submitters or by the Yahoo! human indexers and accompany most Yahoo! - indexed entries.","","Linguistics; World Wide Web; Ontology; Management information systems","","","","","","","","","","ACM","ACM","Proceedings of the 1999 8th International Conference on Information Knowledge Management (CIKM'99)","2 November 1999 through 6 November 1999","Kansas City, MO, USA","56198","","1581131461","00217","","English","Int Conf Inf Knowledge Manage","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033279035"

Customer relationship management system (CRMS) is an innovative technology which facilitates the process to acquire, develop, and maintain customer relationships more efficiently and effectively. From the business perspective, patients represent the major customers of the hospital who receive and feel the healthcare services directly and realistically. Although the critical factors for the adoption of information systems have been identified in previous studies, few have specifically explored CRMS adoption in hospitals despite the fact that it has dramatic impacts on the quality of healthcare services and customer satisfaction. To fill this gap, this study proposes an integrated model that incorporates both organizational and system related factors as primary determiners of CRMS adoption in hospitals. A series of surveys were conducted with three levels of health institutions in Taiwan: medical centers, regional hospitals, and community hospitals. The results indicated that hospital size, IS capabilities of staff, innovation of senior executives, knowledge management capabilities, and relative advantage have significant influence on the CRMS adoption. The research results also reveal constructive suggestions to researchers, hospitals, CRMS vendors, and the government to increase the likelihood of adopting CRMS. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides an overview of this topic by contrasting ways of assessing the validity of effect and causal indicators in structural equation models (SEMs). It also draws a distinction between composite (formative) indicators and causal indicators and argues that validity is most relevant to the latter. Sound validity assessment of indicators is dependent on having an adequate overall model fit and on the relative stability of the parameter estimates for the latent variable and indicators as they appear in different models. If the overall fit and stability of estimates are adequate, then a researcher can assess validity using the unstandardized and standardized validity coefficients and the unique validity variance estimate. With multiple causal indicators or with effect indicators influenced by multiple latent variables, collinearity diagnostics are useful. These results are illustrated with a number of correctly and incorrectly specified hypothetical models.","Causal indicators; Composites; Effect indicators; Formative indicators; Measurement; Reflective indicators; Scale construction; Structural equation models; Validity","Composite materials; Measurement; Hypothetical models; Latent variable; Parameter estimate; Relative stabilities; Structural equation models; Validity; Validity assessment; Variance estimate; Management information systems","","","","","","","Bagozzi R.P., On the meaning of formative measurement and how it differs from reflective measurement, Psychological Methods, 12, pp. 229-237, (2007); Belsley D.A., Kuh E., Welch R.E., Regression Diagnostics, (1980); Blalock H.M., Causal Inferences in Nonexperimental Research, (1964); Bollen K.A., Multiple indicators: Internal consistency or no necessary relationship, Quantity and Quality, 18, 4, pp. 377-385, (1984); Bollen K.A., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Bollen K.A., Interpretational confounding is due to misspecification, not to type of indicator: Comment on Howell, Breivik, and Wilcox, Psychological Methods, 12, 2, pp. 219-228, (2007); Bollen K.A., Davis W.R., Causal indicator models: Identification, estimation, and testing, Structural Equation Modeling, 16, 3, pp. 498-522, (2009); Bollen K.A., Davis W.R., Two rules of identification for structural equation models, Structural Equation Modeling, 16, 3, pp. 523-536, (2009); Bollen K.A., Lennox R., Conventional wisdom on measurement: A structural equation perspective, Psychological Bulletin, 110, 2, pp. 305-314, (1991); Bollen K.A., Ting K., A tetrad test for causal indicators, Psychological Methods, 5, 1, pp. 3-22, (2000); Diamantopoulos A., Riefler P., Roth K.P., Advancing formative measurement models, Journal of Business Research, 61, 12, pp. 1203-1218, (2008); Fornell C., Bookstein F.L., A comparative analysis of two structural equation models: LISREL and PLS applied to market data, A Second Generation of Multivariate Analysis, 1, pp. 289-324, (1982); Grace J.B., Bollen K.A., Representing general theoretical concepts in structural equation models: The role of composite variables, Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 15, 2, pp. 191-213, (2008); Heise D.R., Employing nominal variables, induced variables, and block variables in path analyses, Sociological Methods and Research, 1, pp. 147-173, (1972); Howell R.D., Breivik E., Wilcox J.B., Reconsidering formative measurement, Psychological Methods, 12, 2, pp. 205-218, (2007); Jarvis C.B., Mackenzie S.B., Podsakoff P.M., Giliatt N., Mee J.F., A Critical Review of Construct Indicators and Measurement Model Misspecification in Marketing and Consumer Research, Journal of Consumer Research, 30, 2, pp. 199-218, (2003); Joreskog K.G., Goldberger A.S., Estimation of a model with multiple indicators and multiple causes of a single latent variable, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 70, 351, pp. 631-639, (1975); MacCallum R.C., Browne M.W., The use of causal indicators in covariance structure models: Some practical issues, Psychological Bulletin, 114, 3, pp. 533-541, (1993); Petter S., Straub D., Rai A., Specifying formative constructs in information systems research, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 31, 4, pp. 623-656, (2007)","K.A.

Kohli and Devaraj (2003) provided valuable insights into this issue based on a meta-analysis of 66 BVIT studies. This paper extends Kohli and Devaraj by examining the influences on BVIT through a meta-analysis of 303 studies published between 1990 and 2013. We found that BVIT increases when the study does not consider IT investment, does not use profitability measure of value, and employs primary data sources, fewer IT-related antecedents, and larger sample size. Considerations of IT alignment, IT adoption and use, and interorganizational IT strengthen the relationship between IT investment on BVIT, whereas the focus on environmental theories dampens the same relationship. However, the use of productivity measures of value, the number of dependent variables, the economic region, the consideration of IT assets and IT infrastructure or capability, and the consideration of IT sophistication do not affect BVIT. Finally, BVIT increases over time with IT progress. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.","Business value of information technology; Firm performance; Information technology; Investment; Metaanalysis; Payoff","Information technology; Management information systems; Business value; Firm Performance; Implications for futures; Information technology impact; Inter-organizational; Meta-analysis; Payoff; Productivity measure; Investments","","","","","","","Ada S., Sharman R., Balkundi P., Impact of meta-analytic decisions on the conclusions drawn on the business value of information technology, Decision Support Systems, 54, 1, pp. 521-533, (2012); Akgun A.E., Byrne J.C., Keskin H., Lynn G.S., Transactive memory systems in new product development teams, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 53, 1, pp. 95-111, (2006); Aral S., Brynjolfsson E., Wu L., Three-way complementarities: Performance pay, human resource analytics, and information technology, Management Science, 58, 5, pp. 913-931, (2012); Bacharach S.B., Organizational theories: Some criteria for evaluation, Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 496-515, (1989); Bakos Y.J., Nault B.R., Ownership and investment in electronic networks, Information Systems Research, 8, 4, pp. 321-341, (1997); Banker R.D., Bardhan I.R., Chang H., Lin S., Plant information systems, manufacturing capabilities, and plant performance, MIS Quarterly, 30, 2, pp. 315-337, (2006); Bardhan I., Krishnan V., Lin S., Business value of information technology: Testing the interaction effect of it and r&d on tobin's q, Information Systems Research, 24, 4, pp. 1147-1161, (2013); Barnes P., The analysis and use of financial ratios: A review article, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 14, 4, pp. 449-461, (1987); Barua A., Konana P., Whinston A.B., An empirical investigation of net-enabled business value, MIS Quarterly, 28, 4, pp. 585-620, (2004); Barua A., Kriebel C., Mukhopadhyay T., Information technologies and business value: An analytic and empirical investigation, Information Systems Research, 6, 1, pp. 3-23, (1995); Barua A., Lee B., An economic analysis of the introduction of an electronic data interchange system, Information Systems Research, 8, 4, pp. 398-422, (1997); Barua A., Lee C.H.S., Whinston A.B., The calculus of reengineering, Information Systems Research, 7, 4, pp. 409-428, (1996); Bergeron M., Dexter A.S., An empirical assessment of financial edi value to corporate adopters, Measuring Information Technology Payoff: Contemporary Approaches, pp. 346-364, (1999); Bharadwaj A.S., A resource-based perspective on information technology capability and firm performance: An empirical investigation, MIS Quarterly, 24, 1, pp. 169-196, (2000); Bhatt G., Emdad A., Roberts N., Grover V., Building and leveraging information in dynamic environments: The role of it infrastructure flexibility as enabler of organizational responsiveness and competitive advantage, Information & Management, 47, 7-8, pp. 341-349, (2010); Bhatt G.D., Grover V., Types of information technology capabilities and their role in competitive advantage: An empirical study, Journal of Management Information Systems, 22, 2, pp. 253-277, (2005); Bhattacherjee A., Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices, (2012); Brynjolfsson E., The productivity paradox of information technology, Communications of the ACM, 36, 12, pp. 67-77, (1993); Brynjolfsson E., Hitt L.M., Is information systems spending productive?

This is amply reflected in recent surveys of CIOs, which consistently suggest that the notion of alignment is a top challenge and management priority. Many CIOs face a double challenge when addressing the issue of alignment: they must first clarify top management's expectations and assumptions about IT, which may be contradictory, and then understand their implications for how the IT department should be managed (i.e., translate the function's strategic mission into an IT management model that adds value to the organization). The characterization of the IT function has constituted a central and growing subject of research in the information systems field. Although the extant literature has much to teach us, knowledge in this area is nevertheless fragmented and has not been properly integrated. In response to these limitations, this study proposes and tests a new theory of the contribution of the IT function. Specifically, our objective is to offer an explanation of the contribution of the IT function in organizations with a typology of ideal profiles. A field study was conducted in 24 large Canadian companies in order to validate a set of research propositions. Our results first suggest that there are five distinct ""ideal"" IT management profiles in organizations and each of these profiles tends to focus on specific sources of value. Next, we observed that IT functions that are close to the ideal of any given profile seem to be outperforming those with hybrid profiles. Finally, our findings provide a compelling explanation as to how ideal IT management profiles are adopted in organizations. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the proposed theory.","CIO; Field study; IT contribution; IT function; IT management profile; Theory building;

With both increasing functionality and affordability, HRIS are being used extensively in organisations of all sizes. Despite this, surprisingly little is know about the current usage, whether disparities exist between companies of different sizes, or about the impact HRIS has on the general professional standing of the HR professional. We developed and administered a survey and gave structured interviews to assess and compare the specific areas of use and to introduce a taxonomy that provides a framework for academic discussion and comparison. We further determined whether HRIS usage was strategic, a perceived value-add for the organisation, and its impact on professional standing for HR professionals. These findings were compared to those for other professions that also use MIS. Our results showed that, on average, few differences exist between SME and large company usage. Moreover, we found that the professional standing of HR professionals has been enhanced by the specific use of HRIS for strategic partnering but that this is not as pronounced as that experienced by those from other professions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study draws upon the theory of social influence to examine the role played by group attitudes in mediating the impact of GDSS designs on group decision‐making performance. We found that, in addition to capabilities of GDSS designs, group attitudes toward GDSS were influential in affecting group decision‐making performance. The managerial implications of the study are: (1) effective GDSS designs for supporting groups in equivocal decision‐making contexts should include structures for communication and consensus support and (2) attempts should be made to enhance user attitudes toward the GDSS through design features of the GDSS, training, and facilitation of positive social influences within the group. The study also provides encouraging evidence about the value of social theories, such as the social influence model and the adaptive structuration theory, in investigating GDSS effects. Further, this study illustrates the value of the partial least squares (PLS) analysis method for testing holistic structural models of GDSS effects. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.
